DESCRIPTION
    A zone represents a logical group of related assets within a lake. A zone
    can be used to map to organizational structure or represent stages of data
    readiness from raw to curated. It provides managing behavior that is shared
    or inherited by all contained assets.

    The Zone ID is used to generate names such as database and dataset names
    when publishing metadata to Hive Metastore and BigQuery.
      ▪ Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
      ▪ Must start with a letter.
      ▪ Must end with a number or a letter.
      ▪ Must be between 1-63 characters.
      ▪ Must be unique across all lakes from all locations in a project.

EXAMPLES
    To create a Dataplex zone with name test-zone within lake test-lake in
    location us-central1 with type RAW, and resource location type
    SINGLE_REGION, run:

        $ gcloud dataplex zones create test-zone --location=us-central \
            --lake=test-lake --resource-location-type=SINGLE_REGION \
            --type=RAW

    To create a Dataplex zone with name test-zone within lake test-lake in
    location us-central1 with type RAW,resource location type SINGLE_REGION
    with discovery-enabled and discovery schedule 0 * * * *, run:

        $ gcloud dataplex zones create test-zone --location=us-central \
            --lake=test-lake --resource-location-type=SINGLE_REGION \
            --type=RAW --discovery-enabled --discovery-schedule="0 * * * *"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Zones resource - Arguments and flags that define the Dataplex zone you
     want to create. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument zone on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       ZONE
          ID of the zones or fully qualified identifier for the zones.

          To set the zone attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument zone on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --lake=LAKE
          The identifier of the Dataplex lake resource.

          To set the lake attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument zone on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --lake on the command line.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Dataplex resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument zone on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property dataplex/location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Settings for resources attached as assets within a zone.

     This must be specified.

       --resource-location-type=RESOURCE_LOCATION_TYPE
          Location type of the resources attached to a zone.
          RESOURCE_LOCATION_TYPE must be one of:

           MULTI_REGION
              Resources that are associated with a multi-region location.
           SINGLE_REGION
              Resources that are associated with a single region.

     --type=TYPE
        Type. TYPE must be one of:

         CURATED
            A zone that contains data that is considered to be ready for
            broader consumption and analytics workloads. Curated structured
            data stored in Cloud Storage must conform to certain file formats
            (Parquet, Avro, and Orc) and organized in a hive-compatible
            directory layout.
         RAW
            A zone that contains data that needs further processing before it
            is considered generally ready for consumption and analytics
            workloads.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the zone.

     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
        Display name of the zone.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --validate-only
        Validate the create action, but don't actually perform it.

     Settings to manage the metadata discovery and publishing.

       --[no-]discovery-enabled
          Whether discovery is enabled. Use --discovery-enabled to enable and
          --no-discovery-enabled to disable.

       --discovery-exclude-patterns=[EXCLUDE_PATTERNS,...]
          The list of patterns to apply for selecting data to exclude during
          discovery. For Cloud Storage bucket assets, these are interpreted as
          glob patterns used to match object names. For BigQuery dataset
          assets, these are interpreted as patterns to match table names.

       --discovery-include-patterns=[INCLUDE_PATTERNS,...]
          The list of patterns to apply for selecting data to include during
          discovery if only a subset of the data should considered. For Cloud
          Storage bucket assets, these are interpreted as glob patterns used to
          match object names. For BigQuery dataset assets, these are
          interpreted as patterns to match table names.

       Determines when discovery jobs are triggered.

         --discovery-schedule=DISCOVERY_SCHEDULE
            Cron schedule (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) for running
            discovery jobs periodically. Discovery jobs must be scheduled at
            least 30 minutes apart.

       Describe data formats.

         Describe CSV and similar semi-structured data formats.

           --csv-delimiter=CSV_DELIMITER
              The delimiter being used to separate values. This defaults to
              ','.

           --[no-]csv-disable-type-inference
              Whether to disable the inference of data type for CSV data. If
              true, all columns will be registered as strings. Use
              --csv-disable-type-inference to enable and
              --no-csv-disable-type-inference to disable.

           --csv-encoding=CSV_ENCODING
              The character encoding of the data. The default is UTF-8.

           --csv-header-rows=CSV_HEADER_ROWS
              The number of rows to interpret as header rows that should be
              skipped when reading data rows.

         Describe JSON data format.

           --[no-]json-disable-type-inference
              Whether to disable the inference of data type for Json data. If
              true, all columns will be registered as their primitive types
              (strings, number or boolean). Use --json-disable-type-inference
              to enable and --no-json-disable-type-inference to disable.

           --json-encoding=JSON_ENCODING
