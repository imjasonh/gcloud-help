POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Entry group resource - Arguments and flags that define the Dataplex entry
     group you want to add IAM policy binding to. The arguments in this group
     can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other

        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       ENTRY_GROUP
          ID of the entry group or fully qualified identifier for the entry
          group.

          To set the entry_group attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument entry_group on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Dataplex resource.

          To set the location attribute:

            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property dataplex/location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.

          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Role name to assign to the principal. The role name is the complete
