POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - The name of the EdgeCacheService resource to create.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument service on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       SERVICE
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service. To
          set the service attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument service on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location Id.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument service on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ use global location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable description of the resource.

     --edge-security-policy=EDGE_SECURITY_POLICY
        Resource URL that points at the Cloud Armor edge security policy that
        is applied on each request against the EdgeCacheService.

        Security Policies should be specified as relative resource URLs - for
        example projects/my-project/locations/global/securityPolicies/my-policy

        Note that only security policies with a type of EDGE can be attached to
        an EdgeCacheService.

     --edge-ssl-certificate=[EDGE_SSL_CERTIFICATE,...]
        URLs to sslCertificate resources that are used to authenticate
        connections between users and the EdgeCacheService.

        Certificates should be specified as relative resource URLs - for
        example projects/my-project/locations/global/certificates/my-cert

        Note that only "global" certificates with a "scope" of EDGE_CACHE can
        be attached to an EdgeCacheService.

        You may specify up to 5 SSL certificates per Service.

     --enable-logging
        Specifies whether to enable logging for traffic served by this service.

        Defaults to false.

     --labels=KEY=VALUE
        List of KEY=VALUE labels to attach to this resource.

     --logging-sample-rate=LOGGING_SAMPLE_RATE
        Configures the sampling rate of requests, where 1.0 means all logged
        requests are reported and 0.0 means no logged requests are reported.
        The default value is 1.0, and the value of the field must be in [0, 1].

        This field can only be specified if logging is enabled for this
        service.

     --require-tls
        Require TLS (HTTPS) for all clients connecting to this service.

        Clients who connect over HTTP (port 80) will receive a HTTP 301 to the
        same URL over HTTPS (port 443). You must have at least one (1)
        edgeSslCertificate specified to enable this.
