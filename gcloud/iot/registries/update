            --enable-http-config --enable-mqtt-config \
            --state-pubsub-topic=pubsub-topic-name

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Registry resource - The device registry to update. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument registry on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       REGISTRY
          ID of the registry or fully qualified identifier for the registry.

          To set the registry attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument registry on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud region for the registry.

          To set the region attribute:

     --event-notification-config=[subfolder=SUBFOLDER],[topic=TOPIC]
        The configuration for notification of telemetry events received from
        the device. This flag can be specified multiple times to add multiple
        configs to the device registry. Configs are added to the registry in

        subfolder field is allowed and must be specified last.

         subfolder

            configuration will be used to publish telemetry events. If empty
            all strings are matched.

     --log-level=LOG_LEVEL
        The default logging verbosity for activity from devices in this
        registry. The verbosity level can be overridden by setting a specific
        device's log level.

        LOG_LEVEL must be one of:

         debug
            All events will be logged
         error
