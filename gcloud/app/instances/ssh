NAME
    gcloud app instances ssh - SSH into the VM of an App Engine Flexible
        instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud app instances ssh INSTANCE [--container=CONTAINER]
        [--service=SERVICE] [--version=VERSION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]
        [-- COMMAND ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud app instances ssh lets you remotely log in to your running App
    Engine Flexible instances under two conditions:
      ▪ The instance is running.
      ▪ The instance has an external IP address. To check from the Cloud
        Console, go to the Instances page and confirm that there is an IP
        address listed in the VM IP column. To check from your app.yaml, open
        your app.yaml and look at the network settings. The instance_ip_mode
        field must be either not listed or set to external.

    gcloud app instances ssh resolves the instance's IP address and
    pre-populates the VM with a public key managed by gcloud. If the gcloud
    managed key pair does not exist, it is generated the first time an SSH
    command is run, which may prompt you for a passphrase for the private key
    encryption.

    All SSH commands require the OpenSSH client suite to be installed on Linux
    and Mac OS X. On Windows, the Google Cloud CLI comes with a bundled PuTTY
    suite instead, so it has no external dependencies.

EXAMPLES
    To SSH into an App Engine Flexible instance, run:

        $ gcloud app instances ssh --service=s1 --version=v1 i1

    To SSH into the app container within an instance, run:

        $ gcloud app instances ssh --service=s1 --version=v1 i1 \
          --container=gaeapp

    To SSH into the app container and run a remote command, run:

        $ gcloud app instances ssh --service=s1 --version=v1 i1 \
          --container=gaeapp -- echo hello

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        The instance ID.

     [-- COMMAND ...]
        Remote command to execute on the VM.

        The '--' argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
        left and COMMAND on the right.

FLAGS
     --container=CONTAINER
        Name of the container within the VM to connect to.

     --service=SERVICE
        The service ID.

     --version=VERSION
        The version ID.
