NAME
    gcloud app domain-mappings - view and manage your App Engine domain
        mappings

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud app domain-mappings COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This set of commands can be used to view and manage your app's domain
    mappings.

    App Engine Domain Mappings allow an application to be served via one or
    many custom domains, such as example.com, instead of the default
    https://<PROJECT-ID>.<REGION-ID>.r.appspot.com address. You can use a
    custom domain with or without SSL.

    Use the AUTOMATIC management type to automatically provision an SSL
    certificate for your domain. Use the MANUAL management type to provide your
    own certificate or omit SSL.

EXAMPLES
    To list your App Engine domains, run:

        $ gcloud app domain-mappings list

    To create a domain with an automatically managed certificate, run:

        $ gcloud app domain-mappings create 'example.com' \
            --certificate-management=AUTOMATIC

    To create a domain with a manual certificate, run:

        $ gcloud app domain-mappings create 'example.com' \
            --certificate-management=manual --certificate-id=1234
