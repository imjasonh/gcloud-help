NAME
    gcloud app services set-traffic - set traffic splitting settings

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud app services set-traffic [SERVICES ...] --splits=SPLITS,[SPLITS,...]
        [--migrate] [--split-by=SPLIT_BY; default="ip"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command sets the traffic split of versions across a service or a
    project.

EXAMPLES
    To send all traffic to 'v2' of service 's1', run:

        $ gcloud app services set-traffic s1 --splits=v2=1

    To split traffic evenly between 'v1' and 'v2' of service 's1', run:

        $ gcloud app services set-traffic s1 --splits=v2=.5,v1=.5

    To split traffic across all services:

        $ gcloud app services set-traffic --splits=v2=.5,v1=.5

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [SERVICES ...]
        The services to modify.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --splits=SPLITS,[SPLITS,...]
        Key-value pairs describing what proportion of traffic should go to each
        version. The split values are added together and used as weights. The
        exact values do not matter, only their relation to each other. For
        example, v1=2,v2=2 is equivalent to v1=.5,v2=.5

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --migrate
        The migrate flag determines whether or not to use traffic migration
        during the operation. Traffic migration will attempt to automatically
        migrate traffic from the previous version to the new version, giving
        the autoscaler time to respond. See the documentation here:
        https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/console/trafficmigration
        for more information.

     --split-by=SPLIT_BY; default="ip"
        Whether to split traffic based on cookie, IP address or random.
        SPLIT_BY must be one of: cookie, ip, random.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
