DESCRIPTION
    The flags available to this command represent the fields of a queue that
    are mutable.

EXAMPLES
    To update a Cloud Tasks queue:

        $ gcloud tasks queues update my-queue --clear-max-attempts \
          --clear-max-retry-duration --clear-max-doublings \
          --clear-min-backoff --clear-max-backoff \
          --clear-max-dispatches-per-second \
          --clear-max-concurrent-dispatches --clear-routing-override

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     QUEUE
        The queue to update.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        The location where we want to manage the queue or task. If not
        specified, uses the location of the current project's App Engine app if
        there is an associated app.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-http-header-override
          Clear the field corresponding to --http-header-override.

       --http-header-override=HEADER_FIELD: HEADER_VALUE
          If provided, the specified HTTP headers override the existing headers
          for all tasks in the queue. If a task has a header with the same Key
          as a queue-level header override, then the value of the task header
          will be overriden with the value of the queue-level header.
          Otherwise, the queue-level header will be added to the task headers.
          Header values can contain commas. This flag can be repeated. Repeated
          header fields will have their values overridden.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-http-method-override
          Clear the field corresponding to --http-method-override.

       --http-method-override=HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE
          If provided, the specified HTTP method type override is used for all
          tasks in the queue, no matter what is set at the task-level.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-http-oauth-service-account-email-override
          Clear the field corresponding to
          --http-oauth-service-account-email-override.

       --http-oauth-service-account-email-override=HTTP_OAUTH_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_OVERRIDE
          The service account email to be used for generating an OAuth2 access
          token to be included in the request sent to the target when executing
          the task. The service account must be within the same project as the
          queue. The caller must have 'iam.serviceAccounts.actAs' permission
          for the service account.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-http-oauth-token-scope-override
          Clear the field corresponding to --http-oauth-token-scope-override.

       --http-oauth-token-scope-override=HTTP_OAUTH_TOKEN_SCOPE_OVERRIDE
          The scope to be used when generating an OAuth2 access token to be
          included in the request sent to the target when executing the task.
          If not specified, 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'
          will be used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-http-oidc-service-account-email-override
          Clear the field corresponding to
          --http-oidc-service-account-email-override.

       --http-oidc-service-account-email-override=HTTP_OIDC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_OVERRIDE
          The service account email to be used for generating an OpenID Connect
          token to be included in the request sent to the target when executing
          the task. The service account must be within the same project as the
          queue. The caller must have 'iam.serviceAccounts.actAs' permission
          for the service account.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-http-oidc-token-audience-override
          Clear the field corresponding to --http-oidc-token-audience-override.

       --http-oidc-token-audience-override=HTTP_OIDC_TOKEN_AUDIENCE_OVERRIDE
          The audience to be used when generating an OpenID Connect token to be
          included in the request sent to the target when executing the task.
          If not specified, the URI specified in the target will be used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-http-uri-override
          Clear the field corresponding to --http-uri-override.

       --http-uri-override=KEY:VALUE,[KEY:VALUE,...]
          If provided, the specified HTTP target URI override is used for all
          tasks in the queue depending on what is set as the mode. Allowed
          values for mode are: ALWAYS, IF_NOT_EXISTS. If not set, mode defaults
          to ALWAYS.

          KEY must be at least one of: [scheme, host, port, path, query, mode].
          Any missing keys will use the default.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-log-sampling-ratio
          Clear the field corresponding to --log-sampling-ratio.

       --log-sampling-ratio=LOG_SAMPLING_RATIO
          Specifies the fraction of operations to write to Cloud Logging. This
          field may contain any value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. 0.0 is
          the default and means that no operations are logged.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-attempts
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-attempts.

       --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS
          The maximum number of attempts per task in the queue.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-backoff
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-backoff.

       --max-backoff=MAX_BACKOFF
          The maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it
          fails. Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-concurrent-dispatches
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-concurrent-dispatches.

       --max-concurrent-dispatches=MAX_CONCURRENT_DISPATCHES
          The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be
          dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached,
          Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of outstanding
          requests decreases.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-dispatches-per-second
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-dispatches-per-second.

       --max-dispatches-per-second=MAX_DISPATCHES_PER_SECOND
          The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-doublings
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-doublings.

       --max-doublings=MAX_DOUBLINGS
          The time between retries will double maxDoublings times.

          A tasks retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles
          maxDoublings times, then increases linearly, and finally retries
          retries at intervals of maxBackoff up to maxAttempts times.

          For example, if minBackoff is 10s, maxBackoff is 300s, and
          maxDoublings is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The
          retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by
          2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of maxBackoff
          until the task has been attempted maxAttempts times. Thus, the
          requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-retry-duration
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-retry-duration.

       --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
          The time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the
          task was first run. Once the --max-retry-duration time has passed and
          the task has been attempted --max-attempts times, no further attempts
          will be made and the task will be deleted.

          Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-min-backoff
          Clear the field corresponding to --min-backoff.

       --min-backoff=MIN_BACKOFF
          The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it
          fails. Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-routing-override
          Clear the field corresponding to --routing-override.

       --routing-override=KEY:VALUE,[...]
          If provided, the specified App Engine route is used for all tasks in
          the queue, no matter what is set is at the task-level.

          KEY must be at least one of: [service, version, instance]. Any
          missing keys will use the default.
