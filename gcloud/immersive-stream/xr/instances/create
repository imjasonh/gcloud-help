NAME
    gcloud immersive-stream xr instances create - create an Immersive Stream
        for XR service instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud immersive-stream xr instances create INSTANCE
        --add-region=[autoscaling_buffer=AUTOSCALING_BUFFER],
          [autoscaling_min_capacity=AUTOSCALING_MIN_CAPACITY],
          [capacity=CAPACITY],
          [enable_autoscaling=ENABLE_AUTOSCALING],[region=REGION]
        --version=VERSION (--content=CONTENT : --location=LOCATION) [--async]
        [--fallback-url=FALLBACK_URL] [--gpu-class=GPU_CLASS] [--mode=MODE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create an Immersive Stream for XR service instance.

EXAMPLES
    To create a service instance called my-instance serving content my-content
    with version my-version that has availablilty for 2 concurent sessions in
    us-west1 region and 3 concurrent sessions in us-east4 region, run:

        $ gcloud immersive-stream xr instances create my-instance \
            --content=my-content --version=my-version \
            --add-region=region=us-west1,capacity=2 \
            --add-region=region=us-east4,capacity=3

    Optionally, a fallback url may be specified. Users will be redirected to
    this fallback url when the service instance is unable to provide the
    streaming experience. To create a service instance called my-instance
    serving content my-content with version my-version that has availablilty
    for 2 concurent sessions in us-west1 and uses fallback url
    https://www.google.com run:

        $ gcloud immersive-stream xr instances create my-instance \
            --content=my-content --version=my-version \
            --add-region=region=us-west1,capacity=2 \
            --fallback-url="https://www.google.com"

        By default, the instance is created with mode=ar, which supports both
        3D and AR experiences. Instances can also be configured to use
        3D-only mode. This configuration cannot be updated later.
        To use 3D-only mode, include:

        --mode=3d

        By default, the instance is created with gpu-class=t4. This uses the
        NVIDIA T4 GPU for the instance. Instances can also be configured to
        use NVIDIA L4 GPUs at creation. Note that only certain regions are
        available for L4, and only 3D-only mode is supported. This
        configuration cannot be updated later.
        To use NVIDIA L4 GPU for the instance, include:

        --gpu-class=l4

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        Name of the instance to be created

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --add-region=[autoscaling_buffer=AUTOSCALING_BUFFER],[autoscaling_min_capacity=AUTOSCALING_MIN_CAPACITY],[capacity=CAPACITY],[enable_autoscaling=ENABLE_AUTOSCALING],[region=REGION]
        Flag used to specify region and capacity required for the service
        instance's availability.

            'region' is the region in which the instance is deployed.

            'capacity' is the maxium number of concurrent streaming sessions that the instance can support in the given region.

        This is a repeatable flag.

     --version=VERSION
        Build version tag of the content served by this instance

     Content resource - Immersive Stream for XR content resource served by the
     instance. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --content on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       --content=CONTENT
          ID of the content or fully qualified identifier for the content.

          To set the name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --content on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location for the content.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --content on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ location is always global.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --fallback-url=FALLBACK_URL
        Fallback url to redirect users to when this service instance is unable
        to provide the streaming experience

     --gpu-class=GPU_CLASS
        The class of GPU that is used by this service instance

     --mode=MODE
        The rendering mode that is supported by this service instance

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
