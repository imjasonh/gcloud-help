EXAMPLES
    To delete an intercept endpoint group association called my-association, in
    project ID my-project, run:

    $ gcloud network-security intercept-endpoint-group-associations \        delete my-association --project=my-project --location=global

    OR

    $ gcloud network-security intercept-endpoint-group-associations \        delete \
        projects/my-project/locations/global/\
        interceptEndpointGroupAssociations/my-association

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Intercept endpoint group association resource - Intercept Endpoint Group
     Association. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument INTERCEPT_ENDPOINT_GROUP_ASSOCIATION on the
        command line with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       INTERCEPT_ENDPOINT_GROUP_ASSOCIATION
          ID of the intercept endpoint group association or fully qualified
          identifier for the intercept endpoint group association.

          To set the endpoint-group-association-id attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument INTERCEPT_ENDPOINT_GROUP_ASSOCIATION on the
            command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the intercept endpoint group association.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument INTERCEPT_ENDPOINT_GROUP_ASSOCIATION on the
            command line with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="20m"
        Time to synchronously wait for the operation to complete, after which
        the operation continues asynchronously. Ignored if --no-async isn't
        specified. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
        formats.
