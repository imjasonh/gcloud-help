NAME
    gcloud network-security intercept-deployments create - create an Intercept
        Deployment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud network-security intercept-deployments create
        (INTERCEPT_DEPLOYMENT : --location=LOCATION)
        (--forwarding-rule=FORWARDING_RULE
          : --forwarding-rule-location=FORWARDING_RULE_LOCATION)

        [--max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="20m"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create an intercept deployment. Successful creation of a deployment results
    in a deployment in ACTIVE state. Check the progress of deployment creation
    by using gcloud network-security intercept-deployments list.

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create an intercept deployment called my-deployment, in project ID
    my-project and zone us-central1-a, run:        $ gcloud network-security intercept-deployments create \
            my-deployment --project=my-project --location=us-central1-a \
            --deployment-group-location=global \
            --forwarding-rule=my-forwarding-rule \
            --forwarding-rule-location=us-central1 \
            --intercept-deployment-group=my-deployment-group

    OR

        $ gcloud network-security intercept-deployments create \
            my-deployment --project=my-project --location=us-central1-a \

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
