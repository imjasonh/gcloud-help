NAME
    gcloud network-security intercept-deployment-groups create - create an
        Intercept Deployment Group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud network-security intercept-deployment-groups create
        (INTERCEPT_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP : --location=LOCATION) --network=NETWORK
        [--async] [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="20m"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create an intercept deployment group. Successful creation of a deployment
    group results in a deployment group in ACTIVE state. Check the progress of
    deployment group creation by using gcloud network-security
    intercept-deployment-groups list.

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create a intercept deployment group called my-deployment-group, in
    project ID my-project, run:        $ gcloud network-security intercept-deployment-groups create \
            my-deployment-group --project=my-project --location=global \
            --network=my-network

    OR

        $ gcloud network-security intercept-deployment-groups create \
            my-deployment-group --project=my-project --location=global \
            --network=projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network

    OR

        $ gcloud network-security intercept-deployment-groups create \
            projects/my-project/locations/global/interceptDeploymentGroups/\
        my-deployment-group \
            --network=projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network

    OR

        $ gcloud network-security intercept-deployment-groups create \
            projects/my-project/locations/global/interceptDeploymentGroups/\
        my-deployment-group \
            --network=projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network \
            --description='new description'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Intercept deployment group resource - Intercept Deployment Group. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument INTERCEPT_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP on the command line
        with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       INTERCEPT_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP
          ID of the intercept deployment group or fully qualified identifier
          for the intercept deployment group.

          To set the deployment-group-id attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument INTERCEPT_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP on the command
            line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the intercept deployment group.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument INTERCEPT_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP on the command
            line with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Network resource - Intercept Deployment Group. This represents a Cloud
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --network on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       --network=NETWORK
          ID of the network or fully qualified identifier for the network.

          To set the network-name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --network on the command line.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the deployment group.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="20m"
        Time to synchronously wait for the operation to complete, after which
        the operation continues asynchronously. Ignored if --no-async isn't
        specified. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
        formats.
