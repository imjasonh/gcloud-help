NAME
    gcloud config - view and edit Google Cloud CLI properties

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud config GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The gcloud config command group lets you set, view and unset properties
    used by Google Cloud CLI.

    A configuration is a set of properties that govern the behavior of gcloud
    and other Google Cloud CLI tools. The initial default configuration is set
    when gcloud init is run. You can create additional named configurations
    using gcloud init or gcloud config configurations create.

    To display the path of the active configuration along with information
    about the current gcloud environment, run $ gcloud info.

    To switch between configurations, use gcloud config configurations
    activate.

    gcloud supports several flags that have the same effect as properties in a
    configuration (for example, gcloud supports both the --project flag and
    project property). Properties differ from flags in that flags affect
    command behavior on a per-invocation basis. Properties allow you to
    maintain the same settings across command executions.

    In addition to setting properties in a configuration, and the use of flags,
    it is possible to override the value of a property with an environment
    variable. The matching environment variable for a property is of the form
    'CLOUDSDK_CATEGORY_PROPERTY'. For example, to demonstrate overriding the
    project property in the core category to my-project, use a command like:

        $ CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=my-project gcloud config get core/project

    For more information on configurations, see gcloud topic configurations.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

GROUPS
    GROUP is one of the following:

     configurations
        Manage the set of gcloud named configurations.

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     get
        Print the value of a Google Cloud CLI property.

     list
        List Google Cloud CLI properties for the currently active
        configuration.

     set
        Set a Google Cloud CLI property.

     unset
        Unset a Google Cloud CLI property.

AVAILABLE PROPERTIES
     core
         account
            Account gcloud should use for authentication. Run gcloud auth list
            to see your currently available accounts.

         console_log_format
            Control the format used to display log messages to the console.

            Valid values are:
            ▸ standard - Simplified log messages are displayed on the
              console.
            ▸ detailed - More detailed messages are displayed on the console.

            If unset, default is standard.

         custom_ca_certs_file
            Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.

         default_format
            Sets the default format for printing command resources.
            core/default_format overrides the default yaml format. If the
            command contains a command-specific output format, it takes
            precedence over the core/default_format value. Use
            --verbosity=debug flag to view the command-specific format. Both
            core/format and --format also take precedence over
            core/default_format. The supported formats are limited to: config,
            default, disable, flattened, json, list, none, object, text. For
            more details run $ gcloud topic formats. Run $ gcloud config set
            --help to see more information about core/default_format

         default_regional_backend_service
            If True, backend services in gcloud compute backend-services will
            be regional by default. Setting the --global flag is required for
            global backend services.

         disable_color
            If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the
            terminal.

         disable_file_logging
            If True, gcloud will not store logs to a file. This may be useful
            if disk space is limited.

         disable_prompts
            If True, the default answer will be assumed for all user prompts.
            However, for any prompts that require user input, an error will be
            raised. This is equivalent to either using the global --quiet flag
            or setting the environment variable CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS
            to 1. Setting this property is useful when scripting with gcloud.

         disable_usage_reporting
            If True, anonymous statistics on SDK usage will not be collected.
            This value is set by your choices during installation, but can be
            changed at any time. For more information, see Usage statistics.

         enable_feature_flags
            If True, remote config-file driven feature flags will be enabled.

         format
            Sets the format for printing all command resources. This overrides
            the default command-specific human-friendly output format. Use
            --verbosity=debug flag to view the command-specific format. If both
            core/default_format and core/format are specified, core/format
            takes precedence. If both core/format and --format are specified,
            --format takes precedence. The supported formats are limited to:
            config, default, disable, flattened, json, list, none, object,
            text. For more details run $ gcloud topic formats. Run $ gcloud
            config set --help to see more information about core/format

         log_http
            If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the logs. To see logs
            in the terminal, adjust verbosity settings. Otherwise, logs are
            available in their respective log files.

         max_log_days
            Maximum number of days to retain log files before deleting. If set
            to 0, turns off log garbage collection and does not delete log
            files. If unset, the default is 30 days.

         parse_error_details
            If True, gcloud will attempt to parse and interpret error details
            in API originating errors. If False, gcloud will write flush error
            details as is to stderr/log.

         pass_credentials_to_gsutil
            If True, pass the configured Google Cloud CLI authentication to
            gsutil.

         project
            Project ID of the Cloud Platform project to operate on by default.
            This can be overridden by using the global --project flag.

         show_structured_logs
            Control when JSON-structured log messages for the current verbosity
            level (and above) will be written to standard error. If this
            property is disabled, logs are formatted as text by default.

            Valid values are:
            ▸ never - Log messages as text
            ▸ always - Always log messages as JSON
            ▸ log - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a file
            ▸ terminal - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a terminal

            If unset, default is never.

         trace_token
            Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
            issues. This token will be provided by Google support.

         user_output_enabled
            True, by default. If False, messages to the user and command output
            on both standard output and standard error will be suppressed.

         verbosity
            Default logging verbosity for gcloud commands. This is the
            equivalent of using the global --verbosity flag. Supported
            verbosity levels: debug, info, warning, error, critical, and none.

     accessibility
         screen_reader
            Make gcloud more screen reader friendly.

     ai
         region
            Default region to use when working with AI Platform resources. When
            a --region flag is required but not provided, the command will fall
            back to this value, if set.

     ai_platform
         region
            Default region to use when working with AI Platform Training and
            Prediction resources (currently for Prediction only). It is ignored
            for training resources for now. The value should be either global
            or one of the supported regions. When a --region flag is required
            but not provided, the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     app
         cloud_build_timeout
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for Docker builds to complete during
            deployments. All Docker builds now use the Cloud Build API.

         promote_by_default
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, that version
            will be promoted to receive all traffic for the service. This
            property can be overridden with the --promote-by-default or
            --no-promote-by-default flags.

         stop_previous_version
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, the previously
            deployed version is stopped. If False, older versions must be
            stopped manually.

         use_runtime_builders
            If set, opt in/out to a new code path for building applications
            using pre-fabricated runtimes that can be updated independently of
            client tooling. If not set, the default path for each runtime is
            used.

     artifacts
         location
            Default location to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a location value is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. If this value is
            unset, the default location is global when location value is
            optional.

         repository
            Default repository to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a repository value is required but not provided,
            the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     auth
         access_token_file
            A file path to read the access token. Use this property to
            authenticate gcloud with an access token. The credentials of the
            active account (if it exists) will be ignored. The file should
            contain an access token with no other information.

         disable_credentials
            If True, gcloud will not attempt to load any credentials or
            authenticate any requests. This is useful when behind a proxy that
            adds authentication to requests.

         impersonate_service_account
            While set, all API requests will be made as the given service
            account or target service account in an impersonation delegation
            chain instead of the currently selected account. You can specify
            either a single service account as the impersonator, or a
            comma-separated list of service accounts to create an impersonation
            delegation chain. This is done without needing to create, download,
            or activate a key for the service account or accounts.

            In order to make API requests as a service account, your currently
            selected account must have an IAM role that includes the
            iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission for the service
            account or accounts.

            The roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role has the
            iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission. You can also create
            a custom role.

            You can specify a list of service accounts, separated with commas.
            This creates an impersonation delegation chain in which each
            service account delegates its permissions to the next service
            account in the chain. Each service account in the list must have
            the roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on the next service
            account in the list. For example, when the property is set through
            gcloud config set auth/impersonate_service_account=
            SERVICE_ACCOUNT_1,SERVICE_ACCOUNT_2, the active account must have
            the roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on SERVICE_ACCOUNT_1,
            which must have the roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on
            SERVICE_ACCOUNT_2. SERVICE_ACCOUNT_1 is the impersonated service
            account and SERVICE_ACCOUNT_2 is the delegate.

         login_config_file
            Sets the created login configuration file in
            auth/login_config_file. Calling gcloud auth login will
            automatically use this login configuration unless it is explicitly
            unset.

         service_account_disable_id_token_refresh
            If True, disable ID token refresh for service account.

         service_account_use_self_signed_jwt
            If True, use self signed jwt flow to get service account
            credentials access token. This only applies to service account json
            file and not to the legacy .p12 file.

         token_host
            Overrides the token endpoint to provision access tokens. It can be
            used with Private Service Connect.

     batch
         location
            Default location to use when working with Batch resources. When a
            location value is required but not provided, the command will fall
            back to this value, if set.

     billing
         quota_project
            The Google Cloud project that is billed and charged quota for
            operations performed in gcloud. When unset, the default is
            [CURRENT_PROJECT]. This default bills and charges quota against the
            current project. If you need to operate on one project, but need to
            bill your usage against or use quota from a different project, you
            can use this flag to specify the billing project. If both
            billing/quota_project and --billing-project are specified,
            --billing-project takes precedence.

     builds
         kaniko_cache_ttl
            TTL, in hours, of cached layers when using Kaniko. If zero, layer
            caching is disabled.

         region
            Default region to use when working with Cloud Build resources. When
            a --region flag is required but not provided, the command will fall
            back to this value, if set.

         timeout
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for builds to complete. If unset,
            defaults to 10 minutes.

         use_kaniko
            If True, kaniko will be used to build images described by a
            Dockerfile, instead of docker build.

     component_manager
         additional_repositories
            Comma separated list of additional repositories to check for
            components. This property is automatically managed by the gcloud
            components repositories commands.

         disable_update_check
            If True, Google Cloud CLI will not automatically check for updates.

     composer
         location
            Composer location to use. Each Composer location constitutes an
            independent resource namespace constrained to deploying

            parameter corresponds to the /locations/<location> segment of the
            Composer resource URIs being referenced.

     compute
         image_family_scope
            Sets how images are selected with image families for disk and
            instance creation. By default, zonal image resources are used when
            using an image family in a public image project, and global image
            resources are used for all other projects. To override the default
            behavior, set this property to zonal or global.

         region
            Default region to use when working with regional Compute Engine
            resources. When a --region flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. To see valid choices,
            run gcloud compute regions list.

         use_new_list_usable_subnets_api
            If True, use the new API for listing usable subnets which only

            Context-aware access. This includes user login as well. Some
            services may not support client certificate authorization. If a
            command sends requests to such services, the client certificate
            will not be validated. Run gcloud topic client-certificate for list
            of services supporting this feature.

            a location is required but not provided by a flag, the command will
            fall back to this value, if set.

         tier
            Default tier to use when creating Dataproc Metastore services. When
            a tier is required but not provided by a flag, the command will
            fall back to this value, if set.

            Valid values are:
            ▸ developer - The developer tier provides limited scalability and
              no fault tolerance. Good for low-cost proof-of-concept.
            ▸ enterprise - The enterprise tier provides multi-zone high
              availability, and sufficient scalability for enterprise-level
              Dataproc Metastore workloads.

     ml_engine
         local_python
            Full path to the Python interpreter to use for Cloud ML Engine

         polling_interval
            Interval (in seconds) at which to poll logs from your Cloud ML
            Engine jobs. Note that making it much faster than the default (60)
            will quickly use all of your quota.

            command will fall back to this value, if set.

     notebooks
         location
            Default location to use when working with Notebook resources. When
            a location value is required but not provided, the command will
            fall back to this value, if set.

            Port to use when connected to the proxy server.

         rdns
            If True, DNS queries will not be performed locally, and instead,
            handed to the proxy to resolve. This is default behavior.

         type
            Type of proxy being used. Supported proxy types are: [http,
            http_no_tunnel, socks4, socks5].

         username

            authentication.

     redis
         region
            Default region to use when working with Cloud Memorystore for Redis
            resources. When a region is required but not provided by a flag,
            the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     run

         parent
            Default parent gcloud should use for scc surface.

     secrets
         locations
            A comma separated list of the locations to replicate secrets to.
            Only applies to secrets with a user-managed policy.

         replication-policy
            The type of replication policy to apply to secrets. Allowed values
            are "automatic" and "user-managed". If user-managed then locations
            must also be provided.

     spanner
         instance
            Default instance to use when working with Cloud Spanner resources.
            When an instance is required but not provided by a flag, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set.

     ssh
         putty_force_connect
            Whether or not gcloud should automatically accept new or changed
            host keys when executing plink/pscp commands on Windows. Defaults
            to True, but can be set to False to present these interactive
            prompts to the user for host key checking.

         verify_internal_ip
            Whether or not gcloud should perform an initial SSH connection to
            verify an instance ID is correct when connecting via its internal
            IP. Without this check, gcloud will simply connect to the internal
            IP of the desired instance, which may be wrong if the desired
            instance is in a different subnet but happens to share the same
            internal IP as an instance in the current subnet. Defaults to True.

     storage
         additional_headers
            Includes arbitrary headers in storage API calls. Accepts a comma
            separated list of key=value pairs, e.g.
            header1=value1,header2=value2.

         base_retry_delay
            Second delay between retrying operations. May be multiplied by
            exponential_sleep_multiplier.

         check_hashes
            'check_hashes' specifies how strictly to require integrity checking
            for downloaded data. Legal values are:

            ▸ 'if_fast_else_fail' - (default) Only integrity check if the
              digest will run efficiently (using compiled code), else fail the
              download.

            ▸ 'if_fast_else_skip' - Only integrity check if the server
              supplies a hash and the local digest computation will run
              quickly, else skip the check.

            ▸ 'always' - Always check download integrity regardless of
              possible performance costs.

            ▸ 'never' - Don't perform download integrity checks. This setting
              is not recommended except for special cases such as measuring
              download performance excluding time for integrity checking.

            This option exists to assist users who wish to download a composite
            object and are unable to install crcmod with the C-extension.
            CRC32c is the only available integrity check for composite objects,
            and without the C-extension, download performance can be
            significantly degraded by the digest computation. This option is
            ignored for daisy-chain copies, which don't compute hashes but
            instead (inexpensively) compare the cloud source and destination
            hashes.

         check_mv_early_deletion_fee
            Block mv commands that may incur an early deletion fee (the source
            object in a mv is deleted).

         convert_incompatible_windows_path_characters
            Allows automatic conversion of invalid path characters on Windows.
            If not enabled, Windows will raise an OSError if an invalid
            character is encountered.

         copy_chunk_size
            Chunk size used for copying to in clouds or on disk.

         download_chunk_size
            Chunk size used for downloadinging to clouds.

         exponential_sleep_multiplier
            Used in exponential backoff for retrying operations.

         key_store_path
            Path to a yaml file containing an encryption key, and multiple
            decryption keys for use in storage commands. The file must be
            formatted as follows:

                encryption_key: {A customer-supplied or customer-managed key.}
                decryption_keys:
                - {A customer-supplied key}
                ...

            Customer-supplied encryption keys must be RFC 4648 section 4
            base64-encoded AES256 strings. Customer-managed encryption keys
            must be of the form
            projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{key-ring}/cryptoKeys/{crypto-key}.

         max_retries
            Max number of retries for operations like copy.

         max_retry_delay
            Max second delay between retriable operations.

         multipart_chunksize
            Specifies partition size in bytes of each part of a multipart
            upload made by the Boto3 client. To calculate the maximum size of a
            Boto3 client multipart upload, multiply the multipart_chunk value
            by the maximum number of parts the API allows. For AWS S3 this
            limit is 10000. Values can be provided either in bytes or as
            human-readable values (e.g., "150M" to represent 150 mebibytes).

         multipart_threshold
            Files larger than this threshold will be partitioned into parts,
            uploaded separately by the Boto3 client, and then combined into a
            single object. Otherwise, files smaller than this threshold will be
            uploaded by the Boto3 client in a single stream.

         parallel_composite_upload_compatibility_check
            Determines if the GET bucket call should be performed to check if
            the default storage class and retention period for the destination
            bucket meet the criteria for parallel composite upload.

         parallel_composite_upload_component_prefix
            The prefix used when naming temporary components created by
            composite uploads. If the prefix begins with a /, the temporary
            components are uploaded relative to the bucket name. If the prefix
            does not begin with a /, the temporary components are uploaded
            relative to the prefix portion of the destination object name. For
            example, consider an upload that will create a final object named
            gs://bucket/dir1/dir2/object. Using a prefix of /prefix means
            temporary components use names like
            gs://bucket/prefix/COMPONENT_NAME. Using a prefix of prefix means
            temporary components use names like
            gs://bucket/dir1/dir2/prefix/COMPONENT_NAME. Note that this can
            complicate cleaning up temporary components, as they will not all
            share a common prefix. If this property is not specified, gcloud
            storage uses the prefix
            /gcloud/tmp/parallel_composite_uploads/see_gcloud_storage_cp_help_for_details/.
            If a chosen prefix results in temporary component names longer than
            the maximum length Cloud Storage allows, gcloud storage performs a
            non-composite upload.

         parallel_composite_upload_component_size
            Specifies the ideal size of a component in bytes, which will act as
            an upper bound to the size of the components if ceil(file_size /
            parallel_composite_upload_component_size) is less than the maximum
            number of objects the API allows composing at once. Values can be
            provided either in bytes or as human-readable values (e.g., "150M"
            to represent 150 mebibytes).

         parallel_composite_upload_enabled
            Determines whether parallel composite upload should be used.
            Default value is None which will use parallel composite upload and
            log an appropriate warning for the user explaining that parallel
            composite upload is being used by default.

         parallel_composite_upload_threshold
            Specifies the maximum size of a file to upload in a single stream.
            Files larger than this threshold will be partitioned into component
            parts, uploaded in parallel, then composed into a single object.
            The number of components will be the smaller of ceil(file_size /
            parallel_composite_upload_component_size) and the maximum number of
            objects the API allows composing at once. For Cloud Storage this
            limit is 32. This property has no effect if
            parallel_composite_upload_enabled is set to False.

         process_count
            The maximum number of processes parallel execution should use. When
            process_count and thread_count are both 1, commands use sequential
            execution.

         resumable_threshold
            File operations above this size in bytes will use resumable instead
            of one-shot strategies. For example, a resumable download.

         rsync_files_directory
            Directory path to intermediary files created by rsync.

         rsync_list_chunk_size
            Number of files processed at a time by the rsync command when it
            builds and compares the list of files at the source and
            destination.

         s3_endpoint_url
            If set, boto3 client will connect to this endpoint. Otherwise,
            boto3 selects a default endpoint based on the AWS service used.

         sliced_object_download_component_size
            Target size and upper bound for files to be sliced into. Analogous
            to parallel_composite_upload_component_size.

         sliced_object_download_max_components
            Specifies the maximum number of slices to be used when performing a
            sliced object download. Set None for automatic optimization based
            on system resources.

         sliced_object_download_threshold
            Slice files larger than this value. Zero will block sliced
            downloads. Analogous to parallel_composite_upload_threshold.

         suggest_transfer
            If True, logs messages about when Storage Transfer Service might be
            a better tool than gcloud storage.

         thread_count
            The number of threads parallel execution should use per process.
            When process_count and thread_count are both 1, commands use
            sequential execution.

         tracker_files_directory
            Directory path to tracker files for resumable operations.

         upload_chunk_size
            Chunk size used for uploading to clouds.

         use_gcloud_crc32c
            If True, data integrity checks use a binary subprocess to calculate
            CRC32C hashes with the included gcloud-crc32c tool rather than the
            google-crc32c Python library. This behavior is also triggered when
            the google-crc32c Python library is unavailable even if this
            property is False.

         use_gsutil
            If True, use the deprecated upload implementation which uses
            gsutil.

         use_magicfile
            If True, uses the file --mime <filename> command to guess content
            types instead of the default filename extension-based mechanism.
            Available on UNIX and macOS (and possibly on Windows, if you're
            running Cygwin or some other package that provides implementations
            of UNIX-like commands). When available and enabled use_magicfile
            should be more robust because it analyzes file contents in addition
            to extensions.

         use_threading_local
            If True, reuses some resource if they are already declared on a
            thread. If False, creates duplicates of resources like API clients
            on the same thread. Turning off can help with some bugs but will
            hurt performance.

     survey
         disable_prompts
            If True, gcloud will not prompt you to take periodic usage
            experience surveys.

     vmware
         region
            Default region to use when working with VMware Engine resources.
            When a --region flag is required but not provided, the command will
            fall back to this value, if set.

     workstations
         cluster
            Default cluster to use when working with Workstations resources.
            When a --cluster flag is required but not provided, the command
            will fall back to this value, if set.

         config
            Default configuration to use when working with Workstations
            resources. When a --config flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set.

         region
            Default region to use when working with Workstations resources.
            When a --region flag is required but not provided, the command will
            fall back to this value, if set.
