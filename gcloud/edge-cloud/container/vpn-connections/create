NAME
    gcloud edge-cloud container vpn-connections create - create a VPN
        connection between an Edge Container cluster and a VPC network

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud edge-cloud container vpn-connections create VPN_CONNECTION
        --cluster=CLUSTER --vpc-network=VPC_NETWORK [--async]
        [--high-availability] [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [--location=LOCATION]
        [--nat-gateway-ip=NAT_GATEWAY_IP] [--router=ROUTER]
        [--vpc-project=VPC_PROJECT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a new VPN connection.

EXAMPLES
    To create a connection called 'my-vpn-connection' between the VPC network
    'my-vpc' and the Edge Container cluster 'my-cluster' which is at region
    us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud edge-cloud container vpn-connections create \
            my-vpn-connection --location=us-central1 \
            --vpc-network='my-vpc' --cluster='my-cluster'

    Here VPC network and cluster should be under the same project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Vpn connection resource - VPN connection to create. This represents a
     Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument vpn_connection on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     To set the location attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument vpn_connection on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line;
      ◆ set the property edge_container/location.

     This must be specified.

       VPN_CONNECTION
          ID of the vpn connection or fully qualified identifier for the vpn
          connection.

          To set the vpn_connection attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument vpn_connection on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Cluster resource - The name of the cluster to be connected under current
     project. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --cluster on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     To set the location attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --cluster on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line;
      ◆ set the property edge_container/location.

     This must be specified.

       --cluster=CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --cluster on the command line.

     --vpc-network=VPC_NETWORK
        The name of the VPC network to be connected. By default it is assumed
        to be under the same project as cluster. If this VPC network is under a
        different project, vpc-project is required.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --high-availability
        Enables high availability on cluster side. This creates an additional
        VPN endpoint in cluster. Multiple Nodes/NodePools are required to
        enable this feature.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --location=LOCATION
        For resources [cluster, vpn_connection], provides fallback value for
        resource location attribute. When the resource's full URI path is not
        provided, location will fallback to this flag value.

     --nat-gateway-ip=NAT_GATEWAY_IP
        The NAT gateway IP for the gateway floating IPs. Required if cluster
        sits behind NAT.

     --router=ROUTER
        Name of the Cloud Router to use when creating the VPN connection. This
        Cloud Router must be in the same region as the cluster and connected to
        the provided VPC network. If not provided, a service-managed Cloud
        Router will either be created or reused to create the VPN connection.

     --vpc-project=VPC_PROJECT
        The project of the VPC network. Required if the project of VPC network
        differs from the project of the cluster.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
