DESCRIPTION
    Create an Edge Container cluster.

EXAMPLES
    To create a cluster called my-cluster in region us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud edge-cloud container clusters create my-cluster \
            --location=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - Edge Container cluster to create. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location for the cluster.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --admin-users=ADMIN_USERS
        Username (Google email address) of the user who should be granted
        cluster-admin initially. This currently supports exactly one admin. If
        not set, the account issuing the creation request will be used by
        default.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --cluster-ipv4-cidr=CLUSTER_IPV4_CIDR; default="10.0.0.0/17"
        All pods in the cluster are assigned an RFC1918 IPv4 address from this
        block. This field cannot be changed after creation.

     --container-default-runtime-class=CONTAINER_DEFAULT_RUNTIME_CLASS
        Name of the default runtime class for containers. It supports two
        values RUNC and GVISOR.

     --control-plane-kms-key=CONTROL_PLANE_KMS_KEY
        Google Cloud KMS key that will be used to secure persistent disks of
        the control plane VMs of a remote control plane cluster. The Edge
        Container service account for this project must have
        roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter on the key.

        If not provided, a Google-managed key will be used by default.

     --control-plane-machine-filter=CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_FILTER
        Only machines matching this filter will be allowed to host local
        control plane nodes. The filtering language accepts strings like
        "name=<name>", and is documented here: AIP-160
        (https://google.aip.dev/160).

     --control-plane-node-count=CONTROL_PLANE_NODE_COUNT
        The number of local control plane nodes in a cluster. Use one to create
        a single-node control plane or use three to create a high availability
        control plane. Any other numbers of nodes will not be accepted.

     --control-plane-node-location=CONTROL_PLANE_NODE_LOCATION
        Google Edge Cloud zone where the local control plane nodes will be
        created.

     --control-plane-node-storage-schema=CONTROL_PLANE_NODE_STORAGE_SCHEMA
        Name for the storage schema of control plane nodes.

     --control-plane-shared-deployment-policy=CONTROL_PLANE_SHARED_DEPLOYMENT_POLICY
        Policy configuration about how user application is deployed for local
        control plane cluster. It supports two values, ALLOWED and DISALLOWED.
        ALLOWED means that user application can be deployed on control plane
        nodes. DISALLOWED means that user application can not be deployed on
        control plane nodes. Instead, it can only be deployed on worker nodes.
        By default, this value is DISALLOWED. The input is case insensitive.

     --default-max-pods-per-node=DEFAULT_MAX_PODS_PER_NODE
        The default maximum number of pods per node.

     --enable-google-group-authentication
        If set, the cluster will be configured to use Google Group
        authentication.

     --external-lb-ipv4-address-pools=[EXTERNAL_LB_IPV4_ADDRESS,...]
        IPv4 address pools that are used for data plane load balancing of local
        control plane clusters. Existing pools cannot be updated after cluster
        creation; only adding new pools is allowed. Each address pool must be
        specified as one of the following two types of values: 1. A IPv4
        address range, for example, "10.0.0.1-10.0.0.10". A range that contains
        a single IP (e.g. "10.0.0.1-10.0.0.1") is allowed. 2. A IPv4 CIDR
        block, for example, "10.0.0.1/24" Use comma when specifying multiple
        address pools, for example: --external-lb-ipv4-address-pools
        10.0.0.1-10.0.0.10,10.0.0.1/24

     --fleet-project=FLEET_PROJECT
        Name of the Fleet host project where the cluster is registered.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --lro-timeout=LRO_TIMEOUT
        Overwrite the default LRO maximum timeout.

     --maintenance-window-end=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_END
        End time of the recurring cluster maintenance window in the RFC 3339
        (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. E.g.
        "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z" or "2021-01-01T00:00:00-05:00"

     --maintenance-window-recurrence=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_RECURRENCE
        An RFC 5545 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.8.5.3)
        recurrence rule for how the cluster maintenance window recurs. They go
        on for the span of time between the start and the end time. E.g.
        FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU.

     --maintenance-window-start=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_START
        Start time of the recurring cluster maintenance window in the RFC 3339
        (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. E.g.
        "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z" or "2021-01-01T00:00:00-05:00"

     --offline-reboot-ttl=OFFLINE_REBOOT_TTL
        Specifies the maximum duration a node can reboot offline (without
        connection to Google) and then rejoin its cluster to resume its
        designated workloads. This duration is relative to the machine's most
        recent connection to Google. The maximum allowed duration is 7 days. To
        disallow offline reboot, set the duration to "PT0S". The parameter
        should be an ISO 8601 duration string, for example, "P1DT1H2M3S".

     --release-channel=RELEASE_CHANNEL; default="RELEASE_CHANNEL_UNSPECIFIED"
        Release channel a cluster is subscribed to. It supports two values,
        NONE and REGULAR. NONE is used to opt out of any release channel.
        Clusters subscribed to the REGULAR channel will be automatically
        upgraded to versions that are considered GA quality, and cannot be
        manually upgraded. Additionally, if the REGULAR channel is used, a
        specific target version cannot be set with the 'version' flag. If left
        unspecified, the release channel will default to REGULAR.

     --services-ipv4-cidr=SERVICES_IPV4_CIDR; default="10.96.0.0/12"
        All services in the cluster are assigned an RFC1918 IPv4 address from
        this block. This field cannot be changed after creation.

     --system-addons-config=SYSTEM_ADDONS_CONFIG
        If specified as a YAML/JSON file, customized configuration in this file
        will be applied to the system add-ons.

        For example,

        { "systemAddonsConfig": { "ingress": { "disabled": true, "ipv4_vip":
        "10.0.0.1" } } }

     --version=VERSION
        Target cluster version. For example: "1.5.0".

     --zone-storage-kms-key=ZONE_STORAGE_KMS_KEY
        Google Cloud KMS key that will be used to encrypt and decrypt the root
        key for zone storage encryption. The zone storage KMS key is only
        applicable to the storage infra cluster. The Edge Container service
        account for this project must have
        roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter on the key.

        If not provided, a Google-managed key will be used by default.
