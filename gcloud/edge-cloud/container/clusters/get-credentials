NAME
    gcloud edge-cloud container clusters get-credentials - get credentials of
        an edge-container cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud edge-cloud container clusters get-credentials
        (CLUSTER : --location=LOCATION)
        [--auth-provider-cmd-path=AUTH_PROVIDER_CMD_PATH]
        [--offline-credential] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Fetch credentials for a running Edge Container cluster. This command
    updates a kubeconfig file with appropriate credentials and endpoint
    information to point kubectl at a specific Edge Container cluster. By
    default, credentials are written to HOME/.kube/config. You can provide an
    alternate path by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable. If
    KUBECONFIG contains multiple paths, the first one is used. This command
    enables switching to a specific cluster, when working with multiple
    clusters. It can also be used to access a previously created cluster from a
    new workstation. The command will configure kubectl to automatically
    refresh its credentials using the same identity as the gcloud command-line
    tool. See https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/kubectl for
    kubectl documentation.

EXAMPLES
    To get credentials of a cluster named my-cluster managed in location
    us-west1, run:        $ gcloud edge-cloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster \
            --location=us-west1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - Edge Container cluster to get credentials. The

     This must be specified.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location for the cluster.

          To set the location attribute:

            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.
