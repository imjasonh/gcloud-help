              Examples: `2`, `2.3`, `2.3.4`.

              The current Cloud Composer version will be used within the created
              environment. The Apache Airflow version is a semantic version or an alias
              in the form of major or major.minor version numbers, resolved to the
              latest matching Apache Airflow version supported in the current Cloud

              `composer-2.1.2-airflow-2.3.4`.

              The Cloud Composer portion of the image version is a semantic version or
              an alias in the form of major version number or `latest`, resolved to the
              current Cloud Composer version. The Apache Airflow portion of the image
              version is a semantic version or an alias in the form of major or
              major.minor version numbers, resolved to the latest matching Apache
              Airflow version supported in the given Cloud Composer version. The
              resolved versions are stored in the created environment.

          private-service-connect, vpc-peering.

       --enable-private-endpoint
          Environment cluster is managed using the private IP address of the
          master API endpoint. Therefore access to the master endpoint must be
          from internal IP addresses.

          public IP address.

          Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also
          specified.

       --enable-private-environment
          Environment cluster is created with no public IP addresses on the
          cluster nodes.

          If not specified, cluster nodes will be assigned public IP addresses.

          When used with Composer 3, disable internet connection from any
          Composer component.

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.

       --enable-privately-used-public-ips

          ranges privately. The ranges are specified by '--cluster-ipv4-cidr'
          and --services-ipv4-cidr flags.

          Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also
          specified.

       --master-ipv4-cidr=MASTER_IPV4_CIDR
          IPv4 CIDR range to use for the cluster master network. This should

          specified.

       --web-server-ipv4-cidr=WEB_SERVER_IPV4_CIDR
          IPv4 CIDR range to use for the Airflow web server network. This
          should have a size of the netmask between 24 and 29.

          Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also
          specified.

          10.0.0.0/14).

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.

       --cluster-secondary-range-name=CLUSTER_SECONDARY_RANGE_NAME
          Secondary range to be used as the source for pod IPs. Alias ranges
          will be allocated from this secondary range. NAME must be the name of
          an existing secondary range in the cluster subnetwork.

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.

       --enable-ip-alias
          Enable use of alias IPs
          (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/alias-ip/) for Pod IPs. This
          will require at least two secondary ranges in the subnetwork, one for
          the pod IPs and another to reserve space for the services range.

       --enable-ip-masq-agent
          When enabled, the IP Masquarade Agent
          (https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/enable-ip-masquerade-agent)
          is deployed to your environment's cluster. It performs many-to-one IP
          address translations to hide a pod's IP address behind the cluster
          node's IP address. This is done when sending traffic to destinations
          outside the cluster's pod CIDR range.

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.

       --services-ipv4-cidr=SERVICES_IPV4_CIDR
          IP range for the services IPs.

          Can be specified as a netmask size (e.g. '/20') or as in CIDR notion
          (e.g. '10.100.0.0/20'). If given as a netmask size, the IP range will
          be chosen automatically from the available space in the network.

          If unspecified, the services CIDR range will be chosen with a default
          mask size.

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.

       --services-secondary-range-name=SERVICES_SECONDARY_RANGE_NAME
          Secondary range to be used for services (e.g. ClusterIPs). NAME must
          be the name of an existing secondary range in the cluster subnetwork.

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.
