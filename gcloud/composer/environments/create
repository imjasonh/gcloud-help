     At most one of these can be specified:

       --airflow-version=AIRFLOW_VERSION
          Version of Apache Airflow to run in the environment.

              Must be of the form `X[.Y[.Z]]`, where `[]` denotes optional fragments.
              Examples: `2`, `2.3`, `2.3.4`.

              The current Cloud Composer version will be used within the created
              environment. The Apache Airflow version is a semantic version or an alias
              in the form of major or major.minor version numbers, resolved to the
              latest matching Apache Airflow version supported in the current Cloud

              environment.

       --image-version=IMAGE_VERSION
          Version of the image to run in the environment.

              The image version encapsulates the versions of both Cloud Composer
              and Apache Airflow. Must be of the form
              `composer-A[.B.C[-D.E]]-airflow-X[.Y[.Z]]`, where `[]` denotes optional
              fragments.

              `composer-2.1.2-airflow-2.3.4`.

              The Cloud Composer portion of the image version is a semantic version or
              an alias in the form of major version number or `latest`, resolved to the
              current Cloud Composer version. The Apache Airflow portion of the image
              version is a semantic version or an alias in the form of major or
              major.minor version numbers, resolved to the latest matching Apache
              Airflow version supported in the given Cloud Composer version. The
              resolved versions are stored in the created environment.

     Private Clusters

       --cloud-sql-ipv4-cidr=CLOUD_SQL_IPV4_CIDR
          IPv4 CIDR range to use for the Cloud SQL network. This should have a
          size of the netmask not greater than 24.

          Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also
          specified.

       --composer-network-ipv4-cidr=COMPOSER_NETWORK_IPV4_CIDR
          IPv4 CIDR range to use for the Composer network. This must have a
          size of the netmask between 24 and 29.

          Can be specified for Composer 2.X or greater. Cannot be specified
          unless --enable-private-environment is also specified.

       --connection-subnetwork=CONNECTION_SUBNETWORK
          Subnetwork from which an IP address for internal communications will
          be reserved. Needs to belong to the Compute network to which the
          environment is connected. Can be the same subnetwork as the one to
          which the environment is connected.

          Can be specified for Composer 2.X or greater. Cannot be specified
          unless --enable-private-environment is also specified.

       --connection-type=CONNECTION_TYPE

          be one of VPC_PEERING or PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT.

          Can be specified for Composer 2.X or greater. Cannot be specified
          unless --enable-private-environment is also specified. Cannot be set
          to VPC_PEERING if --connection-subnetwork is also specified.

          CONNECTION_TYPE must be one of: connection-type-unspecified,
          private-service-connect, vpc-peering.

       --disable-private-environment
          Enables internet connection for Composer components.

          When used with Composer 2, this means the environment cluster is
          created with public IP addresses on the cluster nodes.

       --enable-private-endpoint
          Environment cluster is managed using the private IP address of the
          master API endpoint. Therefore access to the master endpoint must be
          from internal IP addresses.

          If not specified, the master API endpoint will be accessible by its
          public IP address.

          Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also
          specified.

       --enable-private-environment
          Disables internet connection from any Composer component.

          When used with Composer 2, the environment cluster is created with no
          public IP addresses on the cluster nodes. If not specified, cluster
          nodes will be assigned public IP addresses.

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.

       --enable-privately-used-public-ips
          When enabled GKE pods and services may use public(non-RFC1918) IP
          ranges privately. The ranges are specified by '--cluster-ipv4-cidr'
          and --services-ipv4-cidr flags.

          Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also
          specified.

       --master-ipv4-cidr=MASTER_IPV4_CIDR
          IPv4 CIDR range to use for the cluster master network. This should
          have a size of the netmask between 23 and 28.

          Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also
          specified.

       --web-server-ipv4-cidr=WEB_SERVER_IPV4_CIDR
          IPv4 CIDR range to use for the Airflow web server network. This
          should have a size of the netmask between 24 and 29.

          Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also
          specified.

     IP Alias (VPC-native)

       --cluster-ipv4-cidr=CLUSTER_IPV4_CIDR
          IP address range for the pods in this cluster in CIDR notation (e.g.
          10.0.0.0/14).

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.

       --cluster-secondary-range-name=CLUSTER_SECONDARY_RANGE_NAME
          Secondary range to be used as the source for pod IPs. Alias ranges
          will be allocated from this secondary range. NAME must be the name of
          an existing secondary range in the cluster subnetwork.

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.

       --enable-ip-alias
          Enable use of alias IPs
          (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/alias-ip/) for Pod IPs. This
          will require at least two secondary ranges in the subnetwork, one for
          the pod IPs and another to reserve space for the services range.

       --enable-ip-masq-agent
          When enabled, the IP Masquarade Agent
          (https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/enable-ip-masquerade-agent)
          is deployed to your environment's cluster. It performs many-to-one IP
          address translations to hide a pod's IP address behind the cluster
          node's IP address. This is done when sending traffic to destinations
          outside the cluster's pod CIDR range.

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.

       --services-ipv4-cidr=SERVICES_IPV4_CIDR
          IP range for the services IPs.

          Can be specified as a netmask size (e.g. '/20') or as in CIDR notion
          (e.g. '10.100.0.0/20'). If given as a netmask size, the IP range will
          be chosen automatically from the available space in the network.

          If unspecified, the services CIDR range will be chosen with a default
          mask size.

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.

       --services-secondary-range-name=SERVICES_SECONDARY_RANGE_NAME
          Secondary range to be used for services (e.g. ClusterIPs). NAME must
          be the name of an existing secondary range in the cluster subnetwork.

          When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless
          --enable-ip-alias is also specified.
