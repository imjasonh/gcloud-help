SYNOPSIS
    gcloud composer GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Cloud Composer is a managed Apache Airflow service that helps you create,
    schedule, monitor and manage workflows. Cloud Composer automation helps you
    create Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow-native tools, such as

    on your workflows and not your infrastructure.
