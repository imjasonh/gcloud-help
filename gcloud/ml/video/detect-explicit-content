NAME
    gcloud ml video detect-explicit-content - detect explicit content in videos

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud ml video detect-explicit-content INPUT_PATH [--async]
        [--output-uri=OUTPUT_URI] [--region=REGION] [--segments=[SEGMENTS,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Detect adult content within a video. Adult content is content generally
    appropriate for 18 years of age and older, including but not limited to
    nudity, sexual activities, and pornography (including cartoons or anime).

    The response includes a bucketized likelihood value, from VERY_UNLIKELY to
    VERY_LIKELY. When Explicit Content Detection evaluates a video, it does so
    on a per-frame basis and considers visual content only (not audio).

EXAMPLES
    To detect explicit content in a video file named
    'gs://my_bucket/input_file.mp4', run the following command.:

        $ gcloud ml video detect-explicit-content \
            gs://my_bucket/input_file.mp4

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INPUT_PATH
        Path to the video to be analyzed. Must be a local path or a Google
        Cloud Storage URI.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --output-uri=OUTPUT_URI
        Location to which the results should be written. Must be a Google Cloud
        Storage URI.

     --region=REGION
        Optional Cloud region where annotation should take place. If no region
        is specified, a region will be determined based on video file location.
        REGION must be one of: asia-east1, europe-west1, us-east1, us-west1.

     --segments=[SEGMENTS,...]
        Segments from the video which you want to analyze (by default, the
        entire video will be treated as one segment). Must be in the format
        START1:END1[,START2:END2,...] (inclusive). START and END of segments
        must be a properly formatted duration string of the form HhMmSs where:

            *  H is the number of hours from beginning of video
            *  M is the number of minutes from the beginning of video
            *  S is the number of seconds from the beginning of the video

        H, M and S can be specified as ints or floats for fractional units (to
        microsecond resolution). Unit chars (e.g. h, m or s) are required.
        Microseconds can be specified using fractional seconds e.g. 0.000569s
        == 569 microseconds.

        Examples:

        0s:23.554048s,24s:29.528064s

        0:1m40s,3m50s:5m10.232265s
