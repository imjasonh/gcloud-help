NAME
    gcloud debug snapshots delete - delete debug snapshots for a Cloud Debugger
        debug target (debuggee)

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud debug snapshots delete [ID ...] [--all-users] [--include-inactive]
        [--location=LOCATION-REGEXP] [--target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (DEPRECATED) Cloud Debugger is deprecated and will be shutdown May 31,
    2023.

    See: https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/deprecations

    gcloud debug snapshots delete is used to delete snapshots from a Cloud
    Debugger debug target (debuggee). It will ask for confirmation before
    deleting any snapshots. To suppress confirmation, use the global --quiet
    option.

EXAMPLES
    To delete all active snapshots created by the current user of the debug
    target (debuggee), without being prompted for confirmation, run:

        $ gcloud debug snapshots delete --target=<debuggee_id> --quiet

    To delete all active and inactive snapshots created by all users of the
    debug target (debuggee), run:

        $ gcloud debug snapshots delete --target=<debuggee_id> --all-users \
            --include-inactive

    To delete the debug snapshots with IDs 'ID1' and 'ID2' (where ID1 and ID2
    were each created by different users) of the debug target (debuggee), run:

        $ gcloud debug snapshots delete ID1 ID2 --target=<debuggee_id> \
            --all-users

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [ID ...]
        Zero or more snapshot resource identifiers. The specified snapshots
        will be deleted.

FLAGS
     --all-users
        If set, matching snapshots from all users will be deleted, rather than
        only snapshots created by the current user.

     --include-inactive
        If set, also delete snapshots which have been completed. By default,
        only pending snapshots will be deleted.

     --location=LOCATION-REGEXP
        A regular expression to match against snapshot locations. All snapshots
        matching this value will be deleted. You may specify --location
        multiple times.

        EXAMPLE:

            gcloud debug snapshots delete \
                --location foo.py:[1-3] --location bar.py:4

     --target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)
        The debug target. It may be a target ID or name obtained from 'debug
        targets list', or it may be a regular expression uniquely specifying a
        debuggee based on its description or name. For App Engine projects, if
        not specified, the default target is the most recent deployment of the
        default module and version.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
