NAME
    gcloud deploy targets remove-iam-policy-binding - remove an IAM policy
        binding for a Cloud Deploy target

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud deploy targets remove-iam-policy-binding (TARGET : --region=REGION)
        --member=PRINCIPAL --role=ROLE
        [--all | --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Removes a policy binding to the IAM policy of a Cloud Deploy target. One
    binding consists of a member and a role.

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

EXAMPLES
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of
    'roles/clouddeploy.operator' for the user 'test-user@gmail.com' on
    'my-target' with the region 'us-central1', run:

        $ gcloud deploy targets remove-iam-policy-binding my-target \
            --region='us-central1' --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/clouddeploy.operator'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Target resource - The target for which to remove the IAM policy binding.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument target on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       TARGET
          ID of the target or fully qualified identifier for the target.

          To set the target attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument target on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          Location of the target.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument target on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property deploy/region.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Deleted principals have an additional deleted: prefix and a ?uid=UID
        suffix, where UID is a unique identifier for the principal. Example:
        deleted:user:test-user@gmail.com?uid=123456789012345678901.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the principal from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and principal, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding that you want to remove. When the
          condition is explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a
          binding without a condition is removed. Otherwise, only a binding
          with a condition that exactly matches the specified condition
          (including the optional description) is removed. For more on
          conditions, refer to the conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.
