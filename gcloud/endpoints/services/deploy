NAME
    gcloud endpoints services deploy - deploys a service configuration for the
        given service name

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud endpoints services deploy SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE
        [SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE ...] [--async] [--force, -f] [--validate-only]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command is used to deploy a service configuration for a service to
    Google Service Management. As input, it takes one or more paths to service
    configurations that should be uploaded. These configuration files can be
    Proto Descriptors, Open API (Swagger) specifications, or Google Service
    Configuration files in JSON or YAML formats.

    If a service name is present in multiple configuration files (given in the
    host field in OpenAPI specifications or the name field in Google Service
    Configuration files), the first one will take precedence.

    This command will block until deployment is complete unless the --async
    flag is passed.

EXAMPLES
    To deploy a single Open API service configuration, run:

        $ gcloud endpoints services deploy ~/my_app/openapi.json

    To run the deployment asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud endpoints services deploy ~/my_app/openapi.json --async

    To deploy a service config with a Proto, run:

        $ gcloud endpoints services deploy ~/my_app/service-config.yaml \
            ~/my_app/service-protos.pb

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE [SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE ...]
        The service configuration file (or files) containing the API
        specification to upload. Proto Descriptors, Open API (Swagger)
        specifications, and Google Service Configuration files in JSON and YAML
        formats are acceptable.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --force, -f
        Force the deployment even if any hazardous changes to the service
        configuration are detected.

     --validate-only
        If included, the command validates the service configuration(s), but
        does not deploy them. The service must exist in order to validate the
        configuration(s).
