NAME
    gcloud endpoints services undelete - undeletes a service configuration that
        was previously deleted

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud endpoints services undelete SERVICE [--async] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Services that are deleted will be retained in the system for 30 days. If a
    deleted service is still within this retention window, it can be undeleted
    with this command.

    Note that this means that this command will not be effective for service
    configurations marked for deletion more than 30 days ago.

EXAMPLES
    To undelete a service named my-service, run:

        $ gcloud endpoints services undelete my-service

    To run the same command asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud endpoints services undelete my-service --async

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE
        The name of the service to undelete.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.
