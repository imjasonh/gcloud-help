NAME
    gcloud storage buckets notifications delete - delete notification
        configurations from a bucket

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud storage buckets notifications delete URLS [URLS ...]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud storage buckets notifications delete deletes notification
    configurations from a bucket. If a notification configuration name is
    passed as a parameter, that configuration alone is deleted. If a bucket
    name is passed, all notification configurations associated with the bucket
    are deleted.

    Cloud Pub/Sub topics associated with this notification configuration are
    not deleted by this command. Those must be deleted separately, for example
    with the command "gcloud pubsub topics delete".

EXAMPLES
    Delete a single notification configuration (with ID 3) in the bucket
    example-bucket:

        $ gcloud storage buckets notifications delete \
            b/example-bucket/notificationConfigs/3

    Delete all notification configurations in the bucket example-bucket:

        $ gcloud storage buckets notifications delete gs://example-bucket

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URLS [URLS ...]
        Specifies notification configuration names or buckets.
