NAME
    gcloud storage buckets anywhere-caches disable - disable Anywhere Cache
        instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud storage buckets anywhere-caches disable ID [ID ...]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Disables one or more Anywhere Cache instances.

    The cache instance will be set to DISABLED state. The existing entries can
    be read from the cache but new entries will not be written to the cache.
    The L4 SSD cache would not be deleted by the cache manager until the min
    TTL (1h) has been reached (cache instance is kept for at least 1h). Google
    Cloud Storage defines the min TTL which is applied to all cache instances.
    Cach disablement could be canceled by using anywhere-caches resume command
    before the instance is deleted.

EXAMPLES
    The following command disables the anywhere cache instance of bucket
    my-bucket having anywhere_cache_id my-cache-id:

        $ gcloud storage buckets anywhere-caches disable \
            my-bucket/my-cache-id

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ID [ID ...]
        Identifiers for a Anywhere Cache instance. They are combination of
        bucket_name/anywhere_cache_id. For example : test-bucket/my-cache-id.
