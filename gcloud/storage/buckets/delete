DESCRIPTION
    Deletes one or more Cloud Storage buckets.

EXAMPLES
    Delete a Google Cloud Storage bucket named "my-bucket":

        $ gcloud storage buckets delete gs://my-bucket gs://my-other-bucket

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URLS [URLS ...]
        Specifies the URLs of the buckets to delete.

FLAGS
     --additional-headers=HEADER=VALUE
        Includes arbitrary headers in storage API calls. Accepts a comma
        separated list of key=value pairs, e.g. header1=value1,header2=value2.
        Overrides the default storage/additional_headers property value for
        this command invocation.

     --continue-on-error, -c
        If any operations are unsuccessful, the command will exit with a
        non-zero exit status after completing the remaining operations. This
        flag takes effect only in sequential execution mode (i.e. processor and
        thread count are set to 1). Parallelism is default.
