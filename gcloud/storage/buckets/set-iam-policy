NAME
    gcloud storage buckets set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for a bucket

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud storage buckets set-iam-policy URLS [URLS ...] POLICY_FILE
        [--continue-on-error, -c] [--etag=ETAG, -e ETAG] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Set the IAM policy for a bucket. For more information, see Cloud Identity
    and Access Management
    (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam).

EXAMPLES
    To set the IAM policy in POLICY-FILE on BUCKET:

        $ gcloud storage buckets set-iam-policy gs://BUCKET POLICY-FILE

    To set the IAM policy in POLICY-FILE on all buckets beginning with "b":

        $ gcloud storage buckets set-iam-policy gs://b* POLICY-FILE

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URLS [URLS ...]
        URLs for buckets to apply the IAM policy to. Can include wildcards.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

FLAGS
     --continue-on-error, -c
        If any operations are unsuccessful, the command will exit with a
        non-zero exit status after completing the remaining operations. This
        flag takes effect only in sequential execution mode (i.e. processor and
        thread count are set to 1). Parallelism is default.

     --etag=ETAG, -e ETAG
        Custom etag to set on IAM policy. API will reject etags that do not
        match this value, making it useful as a precondition during concurrent
        operations.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
