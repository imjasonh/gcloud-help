    command with --exclude-bucket-id-regexes flag. to specify list of bucket id
    regexes.,

        $ gcloud storage intelligence-configs enable --organization=my-org \
            --exclude-bucket-id-regexes="my-bucket-.*"

    To apply location based filters in the storage intelligence plan, Use
    --include-locations or --exclude-locations flags to specify allowed list of
    locations or excluded list of locations. The following command updates
    storage intelligence plan of sub-folder 123456 with the specified list of
    included locations.,

        $ gcloud storage intelligence-configs enable --sub-folder=123456 \
            --include-locations="us-east1","us-west1"

    The following command enables storage intelligence with Trial edition for
    the given project,
