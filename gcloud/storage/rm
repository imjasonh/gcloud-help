NAME
    gcloud storage rm - delete objects and buckets

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud storage rm [URLS ...] [--additional-headers=HEADER=VALUE]
        [--all-versions, -a] [--continue-on-error, -c]
        [--exclude-managed-folders] [--read-paths-from-stdin, -I]
        [--recursive, -R, -r]
        [--if-generation-match=GENERATION
          --if-metageneration-match=METAGENERATION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete objects and buckets.

EXAMPLES
    The following command deletes a Cloud Storage object named my-object from
    the bucket my-bucket:

        $ gcloud storage rm gs://my-bucket/my-object

    The following command deletes all objects directly within the directory
    my-dir but no objects within subdirectories:

        $ gcloud storage rm gs://my-bucket/my-dir/*

    The following command deletes all objects and subdirectories within the
    directory my-dir:

        $ gcloud storage rm gs://my-bucket/my-dir/**

    Note that for buckets that contain versioned objects
    (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning), the above
    command only affects live versions. Use the --recursive flag instead to
    delete all versions.

    The following command deletes all versions of all resources in my-bucket
    and then deletes the bucket.

        $ gcloud storage rm --recursive gs://my-bucket/

    The following command deletes all text files in the top-level of my-bucket,
    but not text files in subdirectories:

        $ gcloud storage rm -recursive gs://my-bucket/*.txt

    The following command deletes one wildcard expression per line passed in by
    stdin:

        $ some_program | gcloud storage rm -I

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [URLS ...]
        The URLs of the resources to delete.

FLAGS
     --additional-headers=HEADER=VALUE
        Includes arbitrary headers in storage API calls. Accepts a comma
        separated list of key=value pairs, e.g. header1=value1,header2=value2.
        Overrides the default storage/additional_headers property value for
        this command invocation.

     --all-versions, -a
        Delete all versions
        (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning) of an object.

     --continue-on-error, -c
        If any operations are unsuccessful, the command will exit with a
        non-zero exit status after completing the remaining operations. This
        flag takes effect only in sequential execution mode (i.e. processor and
        thread count are set to 1). Parallelism is default.

     --exclude-managed-folders
        Excludes managed folders from command operations. By default gcloud
        storage includes managed folders in recursive removals. Please note
        that this flag would not be applicable for hierarchical namespace
        buckets as we always list managed folders for these buckets.

     --read-paths-from-stdin, -I
        Read the list of URLs from stdin.

     --recursive, -R, -r
        Recursively delete the contents of buckets or directories that match
        the path expression. By default, this will delete managed folders as
        well. If the path is set to a bucket, like gs://bucket, the bucket is
        also deleted. This option implies the --all-versions option. If you
        want to delete only live object versions, use the ``**'' wildcard
        instead.

PRECONDITION FLAGS
     --if-generation-match=GENERATION
        Execute only if the generation matches the generation of the requested
        object.

     --if-metageneration-match=METAGENERATION
        Execute only if the metageneration matches the metageneration of the
        requested object.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha storage rm
