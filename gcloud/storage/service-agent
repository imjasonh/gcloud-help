SYNOPSIS
    gcloud storage service-agent [--authorize-cmek=AUTHORIZE_CMEK]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud storage service-agent displays the Cloud Storage service agent,
    which is used to perform Cloud KMS operations against your a default or
    supplied project. If the project does not yet have a service agent, gcloud
    storage service-agent creates one.

EXAMPLES
    To show the service agent for your default project:

        $ gcloud storage service-agent

    To show the service account for my-project:

        $ gcloud storage service-agent --project=my-project

    To authorize your default project to use a Cloud KMS key:

        $ gcloud storage service-agent \
            --authorize-cmek=projects/key-project/locations/us-east1/\
        keyRings/key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key

FLAGS
     --authorize-cmek=AUTHORIZE_CMEK
        Adds appropriate encrypt/decrypt permissions to the specified Cloud KMS
        key. This allows the Cloud Storage service agent to write and read
        Cloud KMS-encrypted objects in buckets associated with the service
        agent's project.
