SYNOPSIS
    gcloud storage restore [URLS ...] [--all-versions, -a] [--async]
        [--[no-]preserve-acl, -p] [--read-paths-from-stdin, -I]
        [--allow-overwrite --deleted-after-time=DELETED_AFTER_TIME
          --deleted-before-time=DELETED_BEFORE_TIME]
        [--if-generation-match=GENERATION
          --if-metageneration-match=METAGENERATION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The restore command restores soft-deleted resources:

        $ gcloud storage restore url...

EXAMPLES
    Restore soft-deleted version of bucket with generations:

        $ gcloud storage restore gs://bucket#123

    Restore several soft-deleted buckets with generations:

        $ gcloud storage restore gs://bucket1#123 gs://bucket2#456

    Restore latest soft-deleted version of object in a bucket.

        $ gcloud storage restore gs://bucket/file1.txt

    Restore a specific soft-deleted version of object in a bucket by specifying
    the generation.

        $ gcloud storage restore gs://bucket/file1.txt#123

    Restore all soft-deleted versions of object in a bucket.

        $ gcloud storage restore gs://bucket/file1.txt --all-versions

    Restore several objects in a bucket (with or without generation):

        $ gcloud storage restore gs://bucket/file1.txt \
            gs://bucket/file2.txt#456

    Restore the latest soft-deleted version of all text objects in a bucket:

        $ gcloud storage restore gs://bucket/**.txt

    Restore a list of objects read from stdin (with or without generation):

        $ cat list-of-files.txt | gcloud storage restore \
            --read-paths-from-stdin

    Restore object with its original ACL policy:

        $ gcloud storage restore gs://bucket/file1.txt --preserve-acl

    Restore all objects in a bucket asynchronously:

        $ gcloud storage restore gs://bucket/** --async

    Restore all text files in a bucket asynchronously:

        $ gcloud storage restore gs://bucket/**.txt --async

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [URLS ...]
        The url of objects to list.

FLAGS
     SYNCHRONOUS RESTORE OPTIONS

       --all-versions, -a
          Restores all versions of soft-deleted objects.

          This flag is only useful for buckets with [object versioning]
          (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning) enabled. In
          this case, the latest soft-deleted version will become live and the
          previous generations will become noncurrent.

          If versioning is disabled, the latest soft-deleted version will
          become live and previous generations will be soft-deleted again.

          This flag disables parallelism to preserve version order.

     --async
        Initiates an asynchronous bulk restore operation on the specified
        bucket.

     --[no-]preserve-acl, -p
        Preserves ACLs when copying in the cloud. This option is Cloud
        Storage-only, and you need OWNER access to all copied objects. If all
        objects in the destination bucket should have the same ACL, you can
        also set a default object ACL on that bucket instead of using this
        flag. Preserving ACLs is the default behavior for updating existing
        objects. Use --preserve-acl to enable and --no-preserve-acl to disable.

     --read-paths-from-stdin, -I
        Read the list of URLs from stdin.

     BULK RESTORE OPTIONS

       --allow-overwrite
          If included, live objects will be overwritten. If versioning is
          enabled, this will result in a noncurrent object. If versioning is
          not enabled, this will result in a soft-deleted object.

       --deleted-after-time=DELETED_AFTER_TIME
          Restores only the objects that were soft-deleted after this time.

       --deleted-before-time=DELETED_BEFORE_TIME
          Restores only the objects that were soft-deleted before this time.

PRECONDITION FLAGS
     --if-generation-match=GENERATION
        Execute only if the generation matches the generation of the requested
        object.

     --if-metageneration-match=METAGENERATION
        Execute only if the metageneration matches the metageneration of the
        requested object.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
