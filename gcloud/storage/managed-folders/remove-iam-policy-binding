DESCRIPTION

    managed folder URL and the binding. For more information, see Cloud
    Identity and Access Management
    (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam).

EXAMPLES
    To remove an IAM policy binding from the role of
    roles/storage.objectCreator for the user john.doe@example.com on a managed
    folder managed-folder in a bucket bucket:

        $ gcloud storage managed-folders remove-iam-policy-binding \
            gs://bucket/managed-folder --member=user:john.doe@example.com \
            --role=roles/storage.objectCreator

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL
        URL of managed folder to remove IAM policy binding from.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Deleted principals have an additional deleted: prefix and a ?uid=UID
        suffix, where UID is a unique identifier for the principal. Example:
        deleted:user:test-user@gmail.com?uid=123456789012345678901.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the principal from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and principal, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding that you want to remove. When the
          condition is explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a
          binding without a condition is removed. Otherwise, only a binding
          with a condition that exactly matches the specified condition
          (including the optional description) is removed. For more on
          conditions, refer to the conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition. Use a full or
          relative path to a local file containing the value of condition.
