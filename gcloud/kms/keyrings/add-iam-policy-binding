NAME
    gcloud kms keyrings add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM policy binding for a
        kms keyring

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud kms keyrings add-iam-policy-binding (KEYRING : --location=LOCATION)
        --member=PRINCIPAL --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Adds a policy binding to the IAM policy of a kms keyring. A binding
    consists of at least one member, a role, and an optional condition.

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/editor' for the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' on the keyring fellowship with location global, run:

        $ gcloud kms keyrings add-iam-policy-binding fellowship \
            --location='global' --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/editor'

    To add an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018 for
    the role of 'roles/cloudkms.signer' and the user 'test-user@gmail.com' on
    the keyring fellowship and location global, run:

        $ gcloud kms keyrings add-iam-policy-binding fellowship \
            --location='global' --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/cloudkms.signer' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Keyring resource - The keyring to add the IAM policy binding. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument keyring on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       KEYRING
          ID of the keyring or fully qualified identifier for the keyring. To
          set the keyring attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument keyring on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the resource. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument keyring on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Role name to assign to the principal. The role name is the complete
        path of a predefined role, such as roles/logging.viewer, or the role ID
        for a custom role, such as
        organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/logging.viewer.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          A condition to include in the binding. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a basic role. Basic roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer. For more on conditions, refer to the
          conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.
