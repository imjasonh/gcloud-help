        EkmConfig

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud kms ekm-config add-iam-policy-binding --location=LOCATION
        --member=PRINCIPAL --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Adds a policy binding to the IAM policy of a kms EkmConfig. A binding
    consists of at least one member, a role, and an optional condition.

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/editor' for the user
    test-user@gmail.com on the EkmConfig with location us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud kms ekm-config add-iam-policy-binding \
            --location='us-central1' --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/editor'

    To add an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2022 for
    the role of 'roles/editor' and the user test-user@gmail.com and location
    us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud kms ekm-config add-iam-policy-binding \
            --location='us-central1' --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/editor' --condition='expression=request.time <
        timestamp("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2022,description=Expires
        at midnight on 2022-12-31'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Location resource - The KMS location resource. This represents a Cloud
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location or fully qualified identifier for the location. To
          set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Role name to assign to the principal. The role name is the complete
        path of a predefined role, such as roles/logging.viewer, or the role ID
        for a custom role, such as
        organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/logging.viewer.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          A condition to include in the binding. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a basic role. Basic roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer. For more on conditions, refer to the
          conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.
