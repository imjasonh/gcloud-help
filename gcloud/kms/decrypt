NAME
    gcloud kms decrypt - decrypt a ciphertext file using a Cloud KMS key

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud kms decrypt --ciphertext-file=CIPHERTEXT_FILE
        --plaintext-file=PLAINTEXT_FILE
        [--additional-authenticated-data-file=ADDITIONAL_AUTHENTICATED_DATA_FILE]
        [--key=KEY] [--keyring=KEYRING] [--location=LOCATION]
        [--skip-integrity-verification] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud kms decrypt decrypts the given ciphertext file using the given Cloud
    KMS key and writes the result to the named plaintext file. Note that to
    permit users to decrypt using a key, they must be have at least one of the
    following IAM roles for that key: roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter,
    roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter.

    Additional authenticated data (AAD) is used as an additional check by Cloud
    KMS to authenticate a decryption request. If an additional authenticated
    data file is provided, its contents must match the additional authenticated
    data provided during encryption and must not be larger than 64KiB. If you
    don't provide a value for --additional-authenticated-data-file, an empty
    string is used. For a thorough explanation of AAD, refer to this guide:
    https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/additional-authenticated-data

    If --ciphertext-file or --additional-authenticated-data-file is set to '-',
    that file is read from stdin. Note that both files cannot be read from
    stdin. Similarly, if --plaintext-file is set to '-', the decrypted
    plaintext is written to stdout.

    By default, the command performs integrity verification on data sent to and
    received from Cloud KMS. Use --skip-integrity-verification to disable
    integrity verification.

EXAMPLES
    To decrypt the file 'path/to/ciphertext' using the key frodo with key ring
    fellowship and location global and write the plaintext to
    'path/to/plaintext.dec', run:

        $ gcloud kms decrypt --key=frodo --keyring=fellowship \
            --location=global --ciphertext-file=path/to/input/ciphertext \
            --plaintext-file=path/to/output/plaintext.dec

    To decrypt the file 'path/to/ciphertext' using the key frodo and the
    additional authenticated data that was used to encrypt the ciphertext, and
    write the decrypted plaintext to stdout, run:

        $ gcloud kms decrypt --key=frodo --keyring=fellowship \
            --location=global \
            --additional-authenticated-data-file=path/to/aad \
            --ciphertext-file=path/to/input/ciphertext --plaintext-file='-'

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --ciphertext-file=CIPHERTEXT_FILE
        File path of the ciphertext file to decrypt. This file should contain
        the result of encrypting a file with gcloud kms encrypt.

     --plaintext-file=PLAINTEXT_FILE
        File path of the plaintext file to output.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --additional-authenticated-data-file=ADDITIONAL_AUTHENTICATED_DATA_FILE
        File path to the optional file containing the additional authenticated
        data.

     --key=KEY
        Cloud KMS key to use for decryption.
        ◆ For symmetric keys, Cloud KMS detects the decryption key version
          from the ciphertext. If you specify a key version as part of a
          symmetric decryption request, an error is logged and decryption
          fails.
        ◆ For asymmetric keys, the encryption key version can't be detected
          automatically. You must keep track of this information and provide
          the key version in the decryption request. The key version itself is
          not sensitive data and does not need to be encrypted.

     --keyring=KEYRING
        Key ring of the key.

     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the keyring.

     --skip-integrity-verification
        Skip integrity verification on request and response API fields.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
