        (--customer=CUSTOMER | --organization=ORGANIZATION)
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--page-token=PAGE_TOKEN]
        [--view=VIEW; default="basic"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Searches for Groups matching a specified query.

EXAMPLES
    To Search groups:

        $ gcloud identity groups search --organization="5149234212"  \
            --labels="cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum"  \
            --page-size=3  \
            --page-token="ala9glealanal908"

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --labels=LABELS
        One or more label entries that apply to the Group. Currently supported
        labels contain a key with an empty value.

        Google Groups are the default type of group and have a label with a key
        of 'cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum' and an empty
        value.

        Existing Google Groups can have an additional label with a key of
        'cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.security' and an empty value added
        to them. This is an immutable change and the security label cannot be
        removed once added.

        POSIX groups have a label with a key of
        'cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.posix'.

        Dynamic groups have a label with a key of
        'cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.dynamic'.

        Identity-mapped groups for Cloud Search have a label with a key of
        'system/groups/external' and an empty value.

        Examples: {"cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum": ""}
        or {"system/groups/external": ""}.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --customer=CUSTOMER
          The customer ID for the customer's G Suite account. Example of
          customer: "C01k1e9nw"

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization ID for the groups being searched.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        The maximum number of results to return.

        Note that the number of results returned may be less than this value
        even if there are more available results. To fetch all results, clients
        must continue calling this method repeatedly until the response no
        longer contains a nextPageToken.

        If unspecified, defaults to 200 'basic' view and to 50 for 'full' view.

        Must not be greater than 1000 for 'basic' view or 500 for 'full' view.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        The nextPageToken value returned from a previous search request, if
        any.

     --view=VIEW; default="basic"
        The level of detail to be returned. There are two possible views:
        'basic' and 'full'. If unspecified, default to 'basic'. VIEW must be
        one of:

         basic
            Default. Only basic group information is returned.

         full
            All group information is returned.
