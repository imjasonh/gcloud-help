NAME
    gcloud scc custom-modules sha list - list the details of Security Health
        Analytics custom modules

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud scc custom-modules sha list
        (--folder=FOLDER | --organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT)
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    List the details of the resident and inherited Security Health Analytics
    custom modules for the specified folder or project. For an organization,
    this command lists only the custom modules that are created at the
    organization level. Custom modules created in child folders or projects are
    not included in the list. To list the resident custom modules and the
    modules that are created in child folders or projects, use gcloud scc
    custom-modules sha list-descendant.

EXAMPLES
    To list resident and inherited Security Health Analytics custom modules for
    organization 123, run:

        $ gcloud scc custom-modules sha list --organization=organizations/123

    To list resident and inherited Security Health Analytics custom modules for
    folder 456, run:

        $ gcloud scc custom-modules sha list --folder=folders/456

    To list resident and inherited Security Health Analytics custom modules for
    project 789, run:

        $ gcloud scc custom-modules sha list --project=projects/789

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          Folder for listing the Security Health Analytics custom modules
          created at the current folder level and inherited modules from CRM
          ancestors. Formatted as folders/456 or just 456.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Organization for listing the Security Health Analytics custom modules
          created at the organization level. Formatted as organizations/123 or
          just 123.

       --project=PROJECT
          ID or number of the project for listing the Security Health Analytics
          custom modules created at current project level and inherited modules
          from CRM ancestors. Formatted as projects/789 or just 789.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
