REQUIRED FLAGS
     --filter=FILTER
        Expression that identifies findings that should be muted.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          Folder where the findings reside. Formatted as folders/456 or just
          456.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Organization where the findings reside. Formatted as
          organizations/123 or just 123.

       --project=PROJECT
          Project (id or number) where the findings reside. Formatted as
          projects/789 or just 789.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the
        location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location
        attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name
        or with the --location argument on the command line. The default
        location is global. NOTE: If you override the endpoint to a regional
        endpoint
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/index.html?rep_location=global#regional-service-endpoint)
        you must specify the correct data location
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/data-residency-support#locations)
        using this flag. The default location on this command is unrelated to
        the default location that is specified when data residency controls are
        enabled for Security Command Center.

     --mute-state=MUTE_STATE; default="muted"
        Desired mute state of the finding. MUTE_STATE must be one of: muted,
        undefined.
