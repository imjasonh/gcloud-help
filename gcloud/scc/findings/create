DESCRIPTION
    Create a Security Command Center finding.

EXAMPLES
    Create an ACTIVE finding testFinding with category: XSS_SCRIPTING attached

            --resource-name='//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/\
        9876'

    Create an ACTIVE finding testFinding with category: XSS_SCRIPTING attached
    to project with project number 9876 under organization 123456 and source
    5678 using the full resource name:

        $ gcloud scc findings create \
            organizations/123456/sources/5678/findings/testFinding \
            --state=ACTIVE --category='XSS_SCRIPTING' \
            --event-time=2023-01-11T07:00:06.861Z \
            --resource-name='//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/\
        9876'

    Create an ACTIVE finding testFinding with category: XSS_SCRIPTING attached
    to project with project number`9876 under organization 123456, source 5678
    and location=eu:

        $ gcloud scc findings create `testFinding` --organization=123456 \
            --source=5678 --state=ACTIVE --category='XSS_SCRIPTING' \
            --event-time=2023-01-11T07:00:06.861Z \
            --resource-name='//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/\
        9876' --location=eu

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Finding resource - The finding to be used for the SCC (Security Command
     Center) command. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource.

     This must be specified.

       FINDING
          ID of the finding or fully qualified identifier for the finding.

          To set the finding attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument finding on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123, then provide the organization id which is the
          suffix of the organization. Example: organizations/123, the id is
          123.

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument finding on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --organization on the command line;
          ▸ Set the organization property in configuration using gcloud
            config set scc/organization if it is not specified in command
            line..

       --source=SOURCE
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123/sources/456, then provide the source id which is
          the suffix of the source. Example: organizations/123/sources/456, the
          id is 456.

          To set the source attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument finding on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --source on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --category=CATEGORY
        Taxonomy group within findings from a given source. Example:
        XSS_SCRIPTING

     --event-time=EVENT_TIME
        Time at which the event took place. For example, if the finding
        represents an open firewall it would capture the time the open firewall
        was detected. If event-time is not provided, it will default to UTC
        version of NOW. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        supported time formats.

     --resource-name=RESOURCE_NAME
        Full resource name of the Google Cloud Platform resource this finding
        is for.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --external-uri=EXTERNAL_URI
        URI that, if available, points to a web page outside of Cloud SCC
        (Security Command Center) where additional information about the
        finding can be found. This field is guaranteed to be either empty or a
        well formed URL.

     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the
        location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location
        attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name
        or with the --location argument on the command line. The default
        location is global. NOTE: If you override the endpoint to a regional
        endpoint
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/index.html?rep_location=global#regional-service-endpoint)
        you must specify the correct data location
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/data-residency-support#locations)
        using this flag. The default location on this command is unrelated to
        the default location that is specified when data residency controls are
        enabled for Security Command Center.

     --source-properties=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Source specific properties. These properties are managed by the source
        that writes the finding. The key names in the source_properties map
        must be between 1 and 255 characters, and must start with a letter and
        contain alphanumeric characters or underscores only. For example
        "key1=val1,key2=val2"

     --state=STATE
        State is one of: [ACTIVE, INACTIVE]. STATE must be one of: active,
        inactive, state-unspecified.

    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
