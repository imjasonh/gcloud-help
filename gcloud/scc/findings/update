SYNOPSIS
    gcloud scc findings update FINDING [--event-time=EVENT_TIME]
        [--external-uri=EXTERNAL_URI] [--location=LOCATION; default="global"]
        [--source=SOURCE; default="-"] [--source-properties=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--state=STATE] [--update-mask=UPDATE_MASK]
        [--folder=FOLDER | --organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Update a Security Command Center finding.

EXAMPLES
    Update testFinding's state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE:

        $ gcloud scc findings update `testFinding` --organization=123456 \
            --source=5678 --state=INACTIVE

    Update testFinding's state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE using project name for
    example-project:

        $ gcloud scc findings update \
            projects/example-project/sources/5678/findings/testFinding \
            --state=INACTIVE

    Update testFinding's state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE using folder name 456:

        $ gcloud scc findings update \
            folders/456/sources/5678/findings/testFinding --state=INACTIVE

    Override all source properties on testFinding:

        $ gcloud scc findings update `testFinding` --organization=123456 \
            --source=5678 \
            --source-properties="propKey1=propVal1,propKey2=propVal2"

    Selectively update a specific source property on testFinding:

        $ gcloud scc findings update `testFinding` --organization=123456 \
            --source=5678 \
            --source-properties="propKey1=propVal1,propKey2=propVal2" \
            --update-mask="source_properties.propKey1"

    Update finding testFinding with location=eu, state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE:

        $ gcloud scc findings update `testFinding` --organization=123456 \
            --source=5678 --state=INACTIVE --location=eu

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FINDING
        ID of the finding or fully qualified identifier for the finding.

FLAGS
     --event-time=EVENT_TIME
        Time at which the event took place. For example, if the finding
        represents an open firewall it would capture the time the open firewall
        was detected. If event-time is not provided, it will default to UTC
        version of NOW. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        supported time formats.

     --external-uri=EXTERNAL_URI
        URI that, if available, points to a web page outside of Cloud SCC
        (Security Command Center) where additional information about the
        finding can be found. This field is guaranteed to be either empty or a
        well formed URL.

     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the
        location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location
        attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name
        or with the --location argument on the command line. The default
        location is global.

        The default location on this command is unrelated to the default
        location that is specified when data residency controls are enabled for
        Security Command Center.

     --source=SOURCE; default="-"
        Source id. Defaults to all sources.

     --source-properties=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Source specific properties. These properties are managed by the source
        that writes the finding. The key names in the source_properties map
        must be between 1 and 255 characters, and must start with a letter and
        contain alphanumeric characters or underscores only. For example
        "key1=val1,key2=val2"

     --state=STATE
        State is one of: [ACTIVE, INACTIVE]. STATE must be one of: active,
        inactive, state-unspecified.

     --update-mask=UPDATE_MASK
        Optional: If left unspecified (default), an update-mask is
        automatically created using the flags specified in the command and only
        those values are updated. For example: --external-uri='<some-uri>'
        --event-time='<some-time>' would automatically generate
        --update-mask='external_uri,event_time'. Note that as a result, only
        external-uri and event-time are updated for the given finding and
        everything else remains untouched. If you want to delete
        attributes/properties (that are not being changed in the update
        command) use an empty update-mask (''). That will delete all the
        mutable properties/attributes that aren't specified as flags in the
        update command. In the above example it would delete source-properties.
        State can be toggled from ACTIVE to INACTIVE and vice-versa but it
        cannot be deleted.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          The folder ID (e.g., 456) that contains the finding.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization ID (e.g., 123) that contains the finding.

       --project=PROJECT
          The project ID (e.g., example-project) that contains the finding.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
