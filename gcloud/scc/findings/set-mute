POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FINDING
        ID of the finding or the full resource name of the finding.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --mute=MUTE
        Desired mute state of the finding. MUTE must be one of: muted, unmuted,
        undefined.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the
        location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location
        attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name
        or with the --location argument on the command line. The default
        location is global.

        NOTE: If you override the endpoint to a regional endpoint
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/index.html?rep_location=global#regional-service-endpoint)
        you must specify the correct data location
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/data-residency-support#locations)
        using this flag. The default location on this command is unrelated to
        the default location that is specified when data residency controls are
        enabled for Security Command Center.

        NOTE: If no location is specified, the default location is global AND
        the request will be routed to the SCC V1 API. To use the SCC V2 API -
        please explicitly specify the flag.

     --source=SOURCE
        ID of the source.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER

          456.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Organization where the finding resides. Formatted as
          organizations/123 or just 123.

       --project=PROJECT
          Project (id or number) where the finding resides. Formatted as
          projects/789 or just 789.
