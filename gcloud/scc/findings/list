        $ gcloud scc findings list folders/456 --filter="state=\"ACTIVE\""

    List all ACTIVE findings under organization 123456 and source 5678:

        $ gcloud scc findings list 123456 --source=5678 \
            --filter="state=\"ACTIVE\""

    Only list category and resource_name of all ACTIVE findings under
    organization 123456 and source 5678:

        $ gcloud scc findings list 123456 --source=5678 \

            --filter="state=\"ACTIVE\" AND category=\"XSS\""

    List all findings attached to a particular resource under organization
    123456:

        $ gcloud scc findings list 123456 \
            --filter="resource_name=\"//container.googleapis.com/projects/\
        pid/zones/zone-id/clusters/cluster-id\""

    List all ACTIVE findings that took place on 2019-01-01T01:00:00 GMT time,
    under organization 123456:

            --filter="state=\"ACTIVE\"" --read-time="2019-01-01T01:00:00Z"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Parent resource - parent organization, folder, or project in the Google
     Cloud resource hierarchy to be used for the gcloud scc command. Specify
     the argument as either [RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_ID] or [RESOURCE_ID], as
     shown in the preceding examples. This represents a Cloud resource.

       [PARENT]
          ID of the parent or fully qualified identifier for the parent.

          To set the parent attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument parent on the command line;
          ▸ Set the parent property in configuration using gcloud config set
            scc/parent if it is not specified in command line.

FLAGS
     --compare-duration=COMPARE_DURATION
        When compare_duration is set, the result's "state_change" attribute is
        updated to indicate whether the finding had its state changed, the
        finding's state remained unchanged, or if the finding was added during
        the compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time. This
        is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The
        state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the
        finding at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between
        the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't
        affected if the finding is made inactive and then active again.
        Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is specified:

        ◆ 'CHANGED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of
          compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time.

        ◆ 'UNCHANGED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of
          compare_duration and did not change state at read_time.

        ◆ 'ADDED': indicates that the finding was not present at the start of
          compare_duration, but was present at read_time.

        ◆ 'REMOVED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of
          compare_duration, but was not present at read_time.

        If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible
        state_change is 'UNUSED', which will be the state_change set for all
        findings present at read_time. If this field is set then 'state_change'
        must be a specified field in 'group_by'. See $ gcloud topic datetimes
        for information on supported duration formats.

     --field-mask=FIELD_MASK
        Field mask to specify the finding fields listed in the response. An
        empty field mask will list all fields. For example:
        --field-mask="finding.category,finding.resource_name" will only output
        category and resource_name for the findings in addition to default
        attributes. Notice the difference between hyphens (-) used with flags
        v/s camel case used in field masks. An empty or missing field mask will
        list all fields.

     --order-by=ORDER_BY
        Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
        String value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields.
        For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default sorting
        order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix "
        desc" should be appended to the field name. For example:
        --order-by="name desc,source_properties.a_property" will order by name
        in descending order while source_properties.a_property in ascending
        order.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        Response objects will return a non-null value for page-token to
        indicate that there is at least one additional page of data. User can
        either directly request that page by specifying the page-token
        explicitly or let gcloud fetch one-page-at-a-time.

     --read-time=READ_TIME
        Time used as a reference point when filtering. Absence of this field
        will default to the API's version of NOW. See $ gcloud topic datetimes
        for information on supported time formats.

     --source=SOURCE; default="-"
        Source id. Defaults to all sources.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
