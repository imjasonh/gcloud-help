SYNOPSIS

        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--filter=FILTER]
        [--location=LOCATION; default="global"] [--update-mask=UPDATE_MASK]

DESCRIPTION
    Update a Security Command Center BigQuery export.

    BigQuery exports that are created with Security Command Center API V2 and
    later include a location attribute. If the location attribute is included
    in the resource name of a BigQuery export, you must specify it when
    referencing the export. For example, the following BigQuery export name has
    location=eu: organizations/123/locations/eu/bigQueryExports/test-bq-export.

EXAMPLES
    Update a BigQuery export with id test-bq-export under organization 123 with
    a dataset abc in project 234 and a filter on category that equals to
    XSS_SCRIPTING:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports update test-bq-export --organization=123 \
            --dataset=projects/234/datasets/abc \
            --description="This is a test BigQuery export" \
            --filter="category=\"XSS_SCRIPTING\""

    Update a BigQuery export with id test-bq-export under folder 456 with a
    dataset abc in project 234 and a filter on category that equals to
    XSS_SCRIPTING:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports update test-bq-export --folder=456 \
            --dataset=projects/234/datasets/abc \
            --description="This is a test BigQuery export" \
            --filter="category=\"XSS_SCRIPTING\""

    Update a BigQuery export with id test-bq-export under project 789 with a
    dataset abc in project 234 and a filter on category that equals to
    XSS_SCRIPTING:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports update test-bq-export --project=789 \
            --dataset=projects/234/datasets/abc \
            --description="This is a test BigQuery export" \
            --filter="category=\"XSS_SCRIPTING\""

    Update a BigQuery export test-bq-export in organization 123 and
    location=global. This command updates the target dataset to
    projects/234/datasets/abc, the export description to This is a test
    BigQuery export and the export filter to XSS_SCRIPTING:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports update test-bq-export --organization=123 \
            --dataset=projects/234/datasets/abc \
            --description="This is a test BigQuery export" \
            --filter="category=\"XSS_SCRIPTING\"" --location=global

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BIG_QUERY_EXPORT
        ID of the BigQuery export e.g. my-bq-export or the full resource name
        of the BigQuery export e.g.
        organizations/123/bigQueryExports/my-bq-export.

FLAGS
     --dataset=DATASET
        The dataset to write findings updates to.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        The text that will be used to describe a BigQuery export.

     --filter=FILTER
        The filter string which will applied to findings muted by a BigQuery
        export.

     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the
        location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location
        attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name
        or with the --location argument on the command line. The default
        location is global. NOTE: If you override the endpoint to a regional
        endpoint
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/index.html?rep_location=global#regional-service-endpoint)
        you must specify the correct data location
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/data-residency-support#locations)
        using this flag. The default location on this command is unrelated to
        the default location that is specified when data residency controls are
        enabled for Security Command Center.

     --update-mask=UPDATE_MASK
        Optional: If left unspecified (default), an update-mask is
        automatically created using the flags specified in the command and only
        those values are updated.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          Folder where the BigQuery export resides. Formatted as folders/456 or
          just 456.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Organization where the BigQuery export resides. Formatted as
          organizations/123 or just 123.

       --project=PROJECT
          Project (id or number) where the BigQuery export resides. Formatted
          as projects/789 or just 789.

    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
