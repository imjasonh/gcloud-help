NAME
    gcloud scc bqexports create - create a Security Command Center BigQuery
        export

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud scc bqexports create BIG_QUERY_EXPORT --dataset=DATASET
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--filter=FILTER]
        [--location=LOCATION; default="global"]
        [--folder=FOLDER | --organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create a Security Command Center BigQuery export.

    BigQuery exports that are created with Security Command Center API V2 and
    later include a location attribute. If a location is not specified, the
    default global location is used. For example, the following BigQuery export
    name has location=global attribute:
    organizations/123/locations/global/bigQueryExports/test-bq-export.

EXAMPLES
    To create a BigQuery export test-bq-export given organization 123 with a
    dataset abc in project 234 and filter on category that equals to
    XSS_SCRIPTING, run:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports create test-bq-export --organization=123 \
            --dataset=projects/234/datasets/abc \
            --description="This is a test BigQuery export" \
            --filter="category=\"XSS_SCRIPTING\""

    To create a BigQuery export test-bq-export given folder 456 with a dataset
    abc in project 234 and filter on category that equals to XSS_SCRIPTING,
    run:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports create test-bq-export --folder=456 \
            --dataset=projects/234/datasets/abc \
            --description="This is a test BigQuery export" \
            --filter="category=\"XSS_SCRIPTING\""

    To create a BigQuery export test-bq-export given project 789 with a dataset
    abc in project 234 and filter on category that equals to XSS_SCRIPTING,
    run:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports create test-bq-export --project=789 \
            --dataset=projects/234/datasets/abc \
            --description="This is a test BigQuery export" \
            --filter="category=\"XSS_SCRIPTING\""

    To create a BigQuery export test-bq-export given organization 123 and
    location=global to send findings with category=XSS_SCRIPTING to the
    BigQuery dataset abc in project 234, run:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports create test-bq-export --organization=123 \
            --dataset=projects/234/datasets/abc \
            --description="This is a test BigQuery export" \
            --filter="category=\"XSS_SCRIPTING\"" --location=global

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BIG_QUERY_EXPORT
        ID of the BigQuery export e.g. my-bq-export or the full resource name
        of the BigQuery export e.g.
        organizations/123/bigQueryExports/my-bq-export.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --dataset=DATASET
        The dataset to write findings updates to.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        The text that will be used to describe a BigQuery export.

     --filter=FILTER
        The filter string which will applied to findings muted by a BigQuery
        export.

     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the
        location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location
        attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name
        or with the --location argument on the command line. The default
        location is global. NOTE: If you override the endpoint to a regional
        endpoint
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/index.html?rep_location=global#regional-service-endpoint)
        you must specify the correct data location
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/data-residency-support#locations)
        using this flag. The default location on this command is unrelated to
        the default location that is specified when data residency controls are
        enabled for Security Command Center.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          Folder where the BigQuery export resides. Formatted as folders/456 or
          just 456.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Organization where the BigQuery export resides. Formatted as
          organizations/123 or just 123.

       --project=PROJECT
          Project (id or number) where the BigQuery export resides. Formatted
          as projects/789 or just 789.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
