NAME
    gcloud scc bqexports get - get a Security Command Center BigQuery export

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud scc bqexports get BIG_QUERY_EXPORT
        [--location=LOCATION; default="global"]

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Get a Security Command Center BigQuery export.

    BigQuery exports that are created with Security Command Center API V2 and
    later include a location attribute. If the location attribute is included
    in the resource name of a BigQuery export, you must specify it when
    referencing the export. For example, the following BigQuery export name has
    location=eu: organizations/123/locations/eu/bigQueryExports/test-bq-export.

EXAMPLES
    To get a BigQuery export under given organization 123 with id
    test-bq-export, run:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports get test-bq-export --organization=123

    To get a BigQuery export under given folder 456 with id test-bq-export,
    run:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports get test-bq-export --folder=456

    To get a BigQuery export under given project 789 with id test-bq-export,
    run:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports get test-bq-export --project=789

    To get a BigQuery export under given organization 123 with id
    test-bq-export, and location=global run:

        $ gcloud scc bqexports get test-bq-export --organization=123 \
            --location=global

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BIG_QUERY_EXPORT
        ID of the BigQuery export e.g. my-bq-export or the full resource name
        of the BigQuery export e.g.
        organizations/123/bigQueryExports/my-bq-export.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the
        location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location
        attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name
        or with the --location argument on the command line. The default
        location is global.

        NOTE: If you override the endpoint to a regional endpoint
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/index.html?rep_location=global#regional-service-endpoint)
        you must specify the correct data location
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/data-residency-support#locations)
        using this flag. The default location on this command is unrelated to
        the default location that is specified when data residency controls are
        enabled for Security Command Center.

        NOTE: If no location is specified, the default location is global AND
        the request will be routed to the SCC V1 API. To use the SCC V2 API -
        please explicitly specify the flag.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          Folder where the BigQuery export resides. Formatted as folders/456 or
          just 456.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Organization where the BigQuery export resides. Formatted as
          organizations/123 or just 123.

       --project=PROJECT
          Project (id or number) where the BigQuery export resides. Formatted
          as projects/789 or just 789.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
