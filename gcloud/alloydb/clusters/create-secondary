DESCRIPTION
    Create a new AlloyDB SECONDARY cluster within a given project.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new cluster, run:

        $ gcloud alloydb clusters create-secondary my-cluster \
            --region=us-central1 \
            --primary-cluster=projects/12345/locations/us-central1/\
        clusters/cluster1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CLUSTER
        AlloyDB cluster ID

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --primary-cluster=PRIMARY_CLUSTER
        AlloyDB primary cluster ID

     --region=REGION
        Regional location (e.g. asia-east1, us-east1). See the full list of
        regions at https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/instance-locations.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --allocated-ip-range-name=ALLOCATED_IP_RANGE_NAME
        Name of the allocated IP range for the private IP AlloyDB cluster, for
        example: "google-managed-services-default". If set, the instance IPs
        for this cluster will be created in the allocated range. The range name
        must comply with RFC 1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
        characters long and match the regular expression
        [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --tags=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of tags KEY=VALUE pairs to bind. Each item must be expressed as
        <tag-key-namespaced-name>=<tag-value-short-name>.

        Example: 123/environment=production,123/costCenter=marketing

     Automated backup policy. If unspecified, automated backups are copied from
     the associated primary cluster.

     --automated-backup-days-of-week=[DAYS_OF_WEEK,...]
        Comma-separated list of days of the week to perform a backup. At least
        one day of the week must be provided. (e.g.,

        must be one of: MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY,
        SUNDAY.

     --automated-backup-start-times=[START_TIMES,...]

     --automated-backup-window=TIMEOUT_PERIOD
