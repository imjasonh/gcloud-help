        Cloud Run service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud run services update-traffic [[SERVICE] --namespace=NAMESPACE]
        [--async] [--platform=PLATFORM; default="managed"]
        [--clear-tags | --set-tags=[TAG=REVISION,...]
          | --remove-tags=[TAG,...] --update-tags=[TAG=REVISION,...]]
        [--region=REGION
          | --cluster=CLUSTER --cluster-location=CLUSTER_LOCATION
          | --context=CONTEXT --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG]

DESCRIPTION
    Adjust the traffic assignments for a Cloud Run service.

EXAMPLES
    To assign 10% of traffic to revision myservice-s5sxn and 90% of traffic to
    revision myservice-cp9kw run:

        $ gcloud run services update-traffic myservice \
          --to-revisions=myservice-s5sxn=10,myservice-cp9kw=90

    To increase the traffic to revision myservice-s5sxn to 20% and by reducing
    the traffic to revision myservice-cp9kw to 80% run:

        $ gcloud run services update-traffic myservice \
          --to-revisions=myservice-s5sxn=20

    To rollback to revision myservice-cp9kw run:

        $ gcloud run services update-traffic myservice \
          --to-revisions=myservice-cp9kw=100

    To assign 100% of traffic to the current or future LATEST revision run:

        $ gcloud run services update-traffic myservice --to-latest

    You can also refer to the current or future LATEST revision in
    --to-revisions by the string "LATEST". For example, to set 10% of traffic
    to always float to the latest revision:

        $ gcloud run services update-traffic myservice \
          --to-revisions=LATEST=10

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - Service to update the configuration of. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.

       [SERVICE]
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service.

          To set the service attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument SERVICE on the command line;
          ▸ specify the service name from an interactive prompt.

       --namespace=NAMESPACE
          Specific to Cloud Run for Anthos: Kubernetes namespace for the
          service.

          To set the namespace attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument SERVICE on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ specify the service name from an interactive prompt with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --namespace on the command line;
          ▸ set the property run/namespace;
          ▸ For Cloud Run on Kubernetes Engine, defaults to "default".
            Otherwise, defaults to project ID.;
          ▸ provide the argument project on the command line;
          ▸ set the property core/project.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --platform=PLATFORM; default="managed"
        Target platform for running commands. Alternatively, set the property
        [run/platform]. PLATFORM must be one of:

         managed
            Fully managed version of Cloud Run. Use with the --region flag or
            set the [run/region] property to specify a Cloud Run region.
         gke
            Cloud Run for Anthos on Google Cloud. Use with the --cluster and
            --cluster-location flags or set the [run/cluster] and
            [run/cluster_location] properties to specify a cluster in a given
            zone.
         kubernetes
            Use a Knative-compatible kubernetes cluster. Use with the
            --kubeconfig and --context flags to specify a kubeconfig file and
            the context for connecting.

     Specify traffic tags. Traffic tags can be assigned to a revision by name
     or to the latest ready revision. Assigning a tag to a revision generates a
     URL prefixed with the tag that allows addressing that revision directly,
     regardless of the percent traffic specified. Keys are tags. Values are
     revision names or "LATEST" for the latest ready revision. For example,
     --set-tags=candidate=LATEST,current=myservice-v1 assigns the tag
     "candidate" to the latest ready revision and the tag "current" to the
     revision with name "myservice-v1" and clears any existing tags. Changing
     tags does not affect the traffic percentage assigned to revisions. When
     using a tags flag and one or more of --to-latest and --to-revisions in the
     same command, the tags change occurs first then the traffic percentage
     change occurs.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-tags
          Remove all tags.

       --set-tags=[TAG=REVISION,...]
          List of key-value pairs to set as tags. All existing tags will be
          removed first.

       Only --update-tags and --remove-tags can be used together. If both are
       specified, --remove-tags will be applied first.

         --remove-tags=[TAG,...]
            List of tags to be removed.

         --update-tags=[TAG=REVISION,...]
            List of key-value pairs to set as tags.

     Arguments to locate resources, depending on the platform used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run (fully managed). Specify
       --platform=managed to use:

         --region=REGION
            Region in which the resource can be found. Alternatively, set the
            property [run/region].

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on Google
       Cloud. Specify --platform=gke to use:

         Cluster resource - Kubernetes Engine cluster to connect to. The
         arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
         resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group
         but can be set in other ways.

         To set the project attribute:
          ▫ provide the argument --cluster on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▫ set the property run/cluster with a fully specified name;
          ▫ specify the cluster from a list of available clusters with a
            fully specified name;
          ▫ provide the argument --project on the command line;
          ▫ set the property core/project.

           --cluster=CLUSTER
              ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

              To set the cluster attribute:
              ◇ provide the argument --cluster on the command line;
              ◇ set the property run/cluster;
              ◇ specify the cluster from a list of available clusters.

           --cluster-location=CLUSTER_LOCATION
              Zone in which the cluster is located. Alternatively, set the
              property [run/cluster_location].

              To set the location attribute:
              ◇ provide the argument --cluster on the command line with a
                fully specified name;
              ◇ set the property run/cluster with a fully specified name;
              ◇ specify the cluster from a list of available clusters with a
                fully specified name;
              ◇ provide the argument --cluster-location on the command line;
              ◇ set the property run/cluster_location;
              ◇ specify the cluster location from a list of available zones.

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on
       VMware. Specify --platform=kubernetes to use:

         --context=CONTEXT
            The name of the context in your kubectl config file to use for
            connecting.

         --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG
            The absolute path to your kubectl config file. If not specified,
            the colon- or semicolon-delimited list of paths specified by
            $KUBECONFIG will be used. If $KUBECONFIG is unset, this defaults to
            ~/.kube/config.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --to-latest
          True to assign 100 percent of traffic to the 'latest' revision of
          this service. Note that when a new revision is created, it will
          become the 'latest' and traffic will be directed to it. Defaults to
          False. Synonymous with '--to-revisions=LATEST=100'.

       --to-revisions=[REVISION-NAME=PERCENTAGE,...]
          Comma separated list of traffic assignments in the form
          REVISION-NAME=PERCENTAGE. REVISION-NAME must be the name for a
          revision for the service as returned by 'gcloud beta run list
          revisions'. PERCENTAGE must be an integer percentage between 0 and
          100 inclusive. Ex service-nw9hs=10,service-nw9hs=20 Up to 100 percent
          of traffic may be assigned. If 100 percent of traffic is assigned,
          the Service traffic is updated as specified. If under 100 percent of
          traffic is assigned, the Service traffic is updated as specified for
          revisions with assignments and traffic is scaled up or down down
          proportionally as needed for revision that are currently serving
          traffic but that do not have new assignments. For example assume
          revision-1 is serving 40 percent of traffic and revision-2 is serving
          60 percent. If revision-1 is assigned 45 percent of traffic and no
          assignment is made for revision-2, the service is updated with
          revsion-1 assigned 45 percent of traffic and revision-2 scaled down
          to 55 percent. You can use "LATEST" as a special revision name to
          always put the given percentage of traffic on the latest ready
          revision.

       --to-tags=[TAG=PERCENTAGE,...]
          Comma separated list of traffic assignments in the form
          TAG=PERCENTAGE. TAG must match a traffic tag on a revision of the
          service. It may match a previously-set tag, or one assigned using the
          --set-tags or --update-tags flags on this command. PERCENTAGE must be
          an integer percentage between 0 and 100 inclusive. Up to 100 percent
          of traffic may be assigned. If 100 percent of traffic is assigned,
          the service traffic is updated as specified. If under 100 percent of
          traffic is assigned, the service traffic is updated as specified to
          the given tags, and other traffic is scaled up or down
          proportionally. For example, assume the revision tagged next is
          serving 40 percent of traffic and the revision tagged current is
          serving 60 percent. If next is assigned 45 percent of traffic and no
          assignment is made for current, the service is updated with next
          assigned 45 percent of traffic and current scaled down to 55 percent.
