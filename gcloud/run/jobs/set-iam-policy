NAME
    gcloud run jobs set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for a job

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud run jobs set-iam-policy JOB POLICY_FILE [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a job, given a job and a
    file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If the given
    policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will succeed
    only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag obtain via
    get-iam-policy will prevent the replacement if the policy for the job has
    been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not contain an etag
    value will replace any existing policy for the job.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for a job with identifier 'my-job'

        $ gcloud run jobs set-iam-policy --region=us-central1 my-job \
            policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.
