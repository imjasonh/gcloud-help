DESCRIPTION
    Creates or updates a Cloud Run job.

EXAMPLES
    To deploy a new job my-data-transformation to Cloud Run:

        $ gcloud run jobs deploy my-data-transformation \
          --image=us-docker.pkg.dev/project/image

    You may also omit the job name. Then a prompt will be displayed with a
    suggested default value:

        $ gcloud run jobs deploy --image=us-docker.pkg.dev/project/image

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Job resource - Job to deploy. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument JOB on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ specify the job name from an interactive prompt with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       [JOB]
          ID of the Job or fully qualified identifier for the Job.

          To set the jobs attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument JOB on the command line;
          ▸ specify the job name from an interactive prompt.

FLAGS
     --binary-authorization=POLICY
        Binary Authorization policy to check against. This must be set to
        "default".

     --breakglass=JUSTIFICATION
        Justification to bypass Binary Authorization policy constraints and
        allow the operation. See
        https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization/docs/using-breakglass for
        more information. Next update or deploy command will automatically
        clear existing breakglass justification.

     --container=CONTAINER
        Specifies a container by name. Flags following --container will apply
        to the specified container.

        Flags that are not container-specific must be specified before
        --container.

     --gpu-type=GPU_TYPE
        The GPU type to use.

     --[no-]gpu-zonal-redundancy
        Set GPU zonal redundancy. Use --gpu-zonal-redundancy to enable and
        --no-gpu-zonal-redundancy to disable.

     --key=KEY
        CMEK key reference to encrypt the container with.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

     --max-retries=MAX_RETRIES
        Number of times a task is allowed to restart in case of failure before
        being failed permanently. This applies per-task, not per-job. If set to
        0, tasks will only run once and never be retried on failure.

     --parallelism=PARALLELISM
        Number of tasks that may run concurrently. Must be less than or equal
        to the number of tasks. Set to 0 to unset.

     --region=REGION
        Region in which the resource can be found. Alternatively, set the
        property [run/region].

     --remove-containers=[CONTAINER,...]
        List of containers to remove.

     --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        the email address of an IAM service account associated with the
        revision of the service. The service account represents the identity of
        the running revision, and determines what permissions the revision has.

     --set-cloudsql-instances=[CLOUDSQL-INSTANCES,...]
        You can specify a name of a Cloud SQL instance if it's in the same
        project and region as your Cloud Run resource; otherwise specify
        <project>:<region>:<instance> for the instance.

     --task-timeout=TASK_TIMEOUT
        Set the maximum time (deadline) a job task attempt can run for. In the
        case of retries, this deadline applies to each attempt of a task. If
        the task attempt does not complete within this time, it will be killed.
        It is specified as a duration; for example, "10m5s" is ten minutes, and
        five seconds. If you don't specify a unit, seconds is assumed. For
        example, "10" is 10 seconds.

     --tasks=TASKS; default=1
        Number of tasks that must run to completion for the execution to be
        considered done.

     --vpc-connector=VPC_CONNECTOR
        Set a VPC connector for this resource.

     --vpc-egress=VPC_EGRESS
        Specify which of the outbound traffic to send through Direct VPC egress
        or the VPC connector for this resource. This resource must have Direct
        VPC egress enabled or a VPC connector to set this flag. VPC_EGRESS must
        be one of:

         all
            (DEPRECATED) Sends all outbound traffic through Direct VPC egress
            or the VPC connector. Provides the same functionality as
            'all-traffic'. Prefer to use 'all-traffic' instead.
         all-traffic
            Sends all outbound traffic through Direct VPC egress or the VPC
            connector.
         private-ranges-only
            Default option. Sends outbound traffic to private IP addresses (RFC
            1918 and Private Google Access IPs) through Direct VPC egress or
            the VPC connector.

            Traffic to other Cloud Run services might require additional
            configuration. See
            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/private-networking#send_requests_to_other_services_and_services
            for more information.

     --add-volume=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a volume to the Cloud Run resource. To add more than one volume,
        specify this flag multiple times. Volumes must have a name and type
        key. Only certain values are supported for type. Depending on the
        provided type, other keys will be required. The following types are
        supported with the specified additional keys:

        cloud-storage: A volume representing a Cloud Storage bucket. This
        volume type is mounted using Cloud Storage FUSE. See
        https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcs-fuse for the details and
        limitations of this filesystem. Additional keys:
        ◆ bucket: (required) the name of the bucket to use as the source of
          this volume
        ◆ readonly: (optional) A boolean. If true, this volume will be
          read-only from all mounts.
        ◆ mount-options: (optional) A list of flags to pass to GCSFuse. Flags
          should be specified without leading dashes and separated by
          semicolons.

        in-memory: An ephemeral volume that stores data in the instance's
        memory. With this type of volume, data is not shared between instances
        and all data will be lost when the instance it is on is terminated.
        Additional keys:
        ◆ size-limit: (optional) A quantity representing the maximum amount
          of memory allocated to this volume, such as "512Mi" or "3G". Data
          stored in an in-memory volume consumes the memory allocation of the
          container that wrote the data. If size-limit is not specified, the
          maximum size will be half the total memory limit of all containers.

        nfs: Represents a volume backed by an NFS server. Additional keys:
        ◆ location: (required) The location of the NFS Server, in the form
          SERVER:/PATH
        ◆ readonly: (optional) A boolean. If true, this volume will be
          read-only from all mounts.

     --clear-volumes
        Remove all existing volumes from the Cloud Run resource, including
        volumes mounted as secrets

     --remove-volume=[VOLUME,...]
        Removes volumes from the Cloud Run resource.

    Container Flags

        If the --container or --remove-containers flag is specified the following
        arguments may only be specified after a --container flag.

         --add-volume-mount=[volume=NAME,mount-path=MOUNT_PATH,...]
            Adds a mount to the current container. Must contain the keys
            volume=NAME and mount-path=/PATH where NAME is the name of a volume
            on this resource and PATH is the path within the container's
            filesystem to mount this volume.

         --args=[ARG,...]
            Comma-separated arguments passed to the command run by the
            container image. If not specified and no '--command' is provided,
            the container image's default Cmd is used. Otherwise, if not
            specified, no arguments are passed. To reset this field to its
            default, pass an empty string.

         --clear-volume-mounts
            Remove all existing mounts from the current container.

         --command=[COMMAND,...]
            Entrypoint for the container image. If not specified, the container
            image's default Entrypoint is run. To reset this field to its
            default, pass an empty string.

         --cpu=CPU
            Set a CPU limit in Kubernetes cpu units.

            Cloud Run supports values fractional values below 1, 1, 2, 4, and
            8. Some CPU values requires a minimum Memory --memory value.

         --depends-on=[CONTAINER,...]
            List of container dependencies to add to the current container.

         --gpu=GPU
            Cloud Run supports values 0 or 1. 1 gpu also requires a minimum 4
            --cpu value and a minimum 16Gi --memory value.

         --memory=MEMORY
            Set a memory limit. Ex: 1024Mi, 4Gi.

         --remove-volume-mount=[MOUNT_PATH,...]
            Removes the volume mounted at the specified path from the current
            container.

         --startup-probe=[KEY=VALUE,...]
            Comma separated settings for startup probe in the form KEY=VALUE.
            Each key stands for a field of the probe described in
            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/rest/v1/Container#Probe.
            Currently supported keys are: initialDelaySeconds, timeoutSeconds,
            periodSeconds, failureThreshold, httpGet.port, httpGet.path,
            grpc.port, grpc.service, tcpSocket.port.

            For example, to set a probe with 10s timeout and HTTP probe
            requests sent to 8080 port of the container:

                $ --startup-probe=timeoutSeconds=10,httpGet.port=8080

            To remove existing probe:

                $ --startup-probe=""

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --clear-env-vars
              Remove all environment variables.

           --env-vars-file=FILE_PATH
              Path to a local YAML or ENV file with definitions for all
              environment variables. All existing environment variables will be
              removed before the new environment variables are added. Example
              YAML content:

                  KEY_1: "value1"
                  KEY_2: "value 2"

              Example ENV content:

                  KEY_1="value1"
                  KEY_2="value 2"

           --set-env-vars=[KEY=VALUE,...]
              List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables. All
              existing environment variables will be removed first.

           Only --update-env-vars and --remove-env-vars can be used together.
           If both are specified, --remove-env-vars will be applied first.

             --remove-env-vars=[KEY,...]
                List of environment variables to be removed.

             --update-env-vars=[KEY=VALUE,...]
                List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables.

         Specify secrets to mount or provide as environment variables. Keys
         starting with a forward slash '/' are mount paths. All other keys
         correspond to environment variables. Values should be in the form
         SECRET_NAME:SECRET_VERSION. For example:
         '--update-secrets=/secrets/api/key=mysecret:latest,ENV=othersecret:1'
         will mount a volume at '/secrets/api' containing a file 'key' with the
         latest version of secret 'mysecret'. An environment variable named ENV
         will also be created whose value is version 1 of secret 'othersecret'.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --clear-secrets
              Remove all secrets.

           --set-secrets=[KEY=VALUE,...]
              List of key-value pairs to set as secrets. All existing secrets
              will be removed first.

           Only --update-secrets and --remove-secrets can be used together. If
           both are specified, --remove-secrets will be applied first.

             --remove-secrets=[KEY,...]
                List of secrets to be removed.

             --update-secrets=[KEY=VALUE,...]
                List of key-value pairs to set as secrets.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --image=IMAGE
              Name of the container image to deploy (e.g.
              us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/job:latest).

           --source=SOURCE
              The location of the source to build. If a Dockerfile is present
              in the source code directory, it will be built using that
              Dockerfile, otherwise it will use Google Cloud buildpacks. See
              https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying-source-code for more
              details. The location can be a directory on a local disk or a
              gzipped archive file (.tar.gz) in Google Cloud Storage. If the
              source is a local directory, this command skips the files
              specified in the --ignore-file. If --ignore-file is not
              specified, use .gcloudignore file. If a .gcloudignore file is
              absent and a .gitignore file is present in the local source
              directory, gcloud will use a generated Git-compatible
              .gcloudignore file that respects your .gitignored files. The
              global .gitignore is not respected. For more information on
              .gcloudignore, see gcloud topic gcloudignore.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --async
          Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
          complete.

       --async cannot be used if executing the job after the update.

         --execute-now
            Execute the job immediately after the creation or update completes.
            gcloud exits once the job has started unless the --wait flag is
            set.

         --wait
            Wait until the execution has completed running before exiting. If
            not set, gcloud exits successfully when the execution has started.
            Implies --execute-now.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-network
          Disconnect this Cloud Run job from the VPC network it is connected
          to.

       Direct VPC egress setting flags group.

         --network=NETWORK
            The VPC network that the Cloud Run job will be able to send traffic
            to. If --subnet is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of
            the network specified by this --network flag. To clear existing VPC
            network settings, use --clear-network.

         --subnet=SUBNET
            The VPC subnetwork that the Cloud Run job will get IPs from. The
            subnetwork must be /26 or larger. If --network is also specified,
            subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified by the
            --network flag. If --network is not specified, network will be
            looked up from this subnetwork. To clear existing VPC network
            settings, use --clear-network.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --clear-network-tags
              Clears all existing network tags from the Cloud Run job.

           --network-tags=[TAG,...]
              Applies the given network tags (comma separated) to the Cloud Run
              job. To clear existing tags, use --clear-network-tags.
