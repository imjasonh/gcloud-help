SYNOPSIS
    gcloud run jobs execute [JOB] [--args=[ARG,...]] [--region=REGION]

DESCRIPTION
    Execute a job.

EXAMPLES
    To execute a job:

        $ gcloud run jobs execute my-job

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Job resource - Job to execute. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument JOB on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ specify the job name from an interactive prompt with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       [JOB]
          ID of the Job or fully qualified identifier for the Job.

          To set the jobs attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument JOB on the command line;
          ▸ specify the job name from an interactive prompt.

FLAGS
     --args=[ARG,...]
        Comma-separated arguments passed to the command run by the container
        image. If provided, an execution will be created with the input values.
        Otherwise, the existing arguments of the job are used.

     --region=REGION
        Region in which the resource can be found. Alternatively, set the
        property [run/region].

     --task-timeout=TASK_TIMEOUT
        The existing maximum time (deadline) a job task attempt can run for. If
        provided, an execution will be created with this value. Otherwise
        existing maximum time of the job is used. In the case of retries, this
        deadline applies to each attempt of a task. If the task attempt does
        not complete within this time, it will be killed. It is specified as a
        duration; for example, "10m5s" is ten minutes, and five seconds. If you
        don't specify a unit, seconds is assumed. For example, "10" is 10
        seconds.

     --tasks=TASKS
        Number of tasks that must run to completion for the execution to be
        considered done. If provided, an execution will be created with this
        value. Otherwise the existing task count of the job is used.

     --update-env-vars=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables overrides for
        an execution of a job. If provided, an execution will be created with
        the merge result of the input values and the existing environment
        variables. New value overrides existing value if they have the same
        key. If not provided, existing environment variables are used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --async
          Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
          complete.

       --wait
          Wait until the execution has completed running before exiting. If not
          set, gcloud exits successfully when the execution has started.
