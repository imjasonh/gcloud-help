NAME
    gcloud active-directory domains update-ldaps-settings - update the LDAPS
        settings for a domain

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud active-directory domains update-ldaps-settings DOMAIN
        (--clear-certificates | [--certificate-pfx-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          : --certificate-password=CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD]) [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Update a Managed Microsoft AD domain's Lightweight Directory Access
    Protocol over TLS/SSL (LDAPS) settings. You must be safelisted for the
    Managed AD LDAPS Alpha in order to use this feature. Consult the API
    documentation for a list of certificate requirements.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The certificate is invalid.
      ▪ The domain specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to view LDAPS settings
        for the domain.

EXAMPLES
    To enable LDAPS for the first time or update the certificates being used:

        $ gcloud active-directory domains update-ldaps-settings \
            my-domain.com \
            --certificate-pfx-file=certificate-chain-with-private-key.pfx \
            --certificate-password="password"

    To disable LDAPS:

        $ gcloud active-directory domains update-ldaps-settings \
            my-domain.com --clear-certificates

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Domain resource - Name of the managed Managed Microsoft AD domain you want
     to update. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are
     not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument domain on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       DOMAIN
          ID of the domain or fully qualified identifier for the domain.

          To set the domain attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument domain on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --clear-certificates
          Disable LDAPS by deleting all existing certificates. Certificates
          will need to be re-uploaded if LDAPS is to be re-enabled.

       Or at least one of these can be specified:

         --certificate-pfx-file=PATH_TO_FILE
            PKCS#12-formatted pfx file that specifies the certificate chain
            used to configure LDAPS. If certificate-password is not specified,
            command will prompt user for secret. Use a full or relative path to
            a local file containing the value of certificate_pfx_file.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --certificate-password=CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
            Password used to encrypt the PKCS#12 certificate. If not specified,
            command will prompt user for secret.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.
