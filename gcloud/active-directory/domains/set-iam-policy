NAME
    gcloud active-directory domains set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for a
        Managed Microsoft AD domain

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud active-directory domains set-iam-policy DOMAIN POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Set the IAM policy associated with a Managed Microsoft AD domain.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The domain specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access the given
        domain's IAM policies.

EXAMPLES
    To set the IAM policy for my-domain.com, run:

        $ gcloud active-directory domains set-iam-policy my-domain.com \
            policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Domain resource - Name of the Managed Microsoft AD domain you want to set
     the IAM policy for. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument domain on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       DOMAIN
          ID of the domain or fully qualified identifier for the domain. To set
          the domain attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument domain on the command line.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
