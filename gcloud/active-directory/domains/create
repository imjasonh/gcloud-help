NAME
    gcloud active-directory domains create - create a Managed Microsoft AD
        domain

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud active-directory domains create DOMAIN --region=[REGION,...]
        --reserved-ip-range=RESERVED_IP_RANGE [--admin-name=ADMIN_NAME]
        [--async] [--authorized-networks=[AUTHORIZED_NETWORKS,...]]
        [--enable-audit-logs] [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create a new Managed Microsoft AD domain with the given name using Google
    Cloud's Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ An AD domain with the same name already exists.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to create AD domains.
      ▪ There is an overlap between the provided CIDR range and authorized
        network's CIDR.
      ▪ A valid region was not provided.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates an AD domain with the name my-domain.com in
    region us-central1, a network peering to my-network and consuming the IP
    address range 10.172.0.0/24.

        $ gcloud active-directory domains create my-domain.com \
            --region=us-central1 --reserved-ip-range="10.172.0.0/24" \
            --authorized-networks=projects/my-project/global/networks/\
        my-network

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Domain resource - Name of the managed Managed Microsoft AD domain you want
     to create. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are
     not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument domain on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       DOMAIN
          ID of the domain or fully qualified identifier for the domain.

          To set the domain attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument domain on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --region=[REGION,...]
        Google Compute Engine region in which to provision domain controllers.

     --reserved-ip-range=RESERVED_IP_RANGE
        Classless Inter-Domain Routing range of internal addresses that are
        reserved for this domain.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --admin-name=ADMIN_NAME
        Name of the administrator that may be used to perform Active Directory
        operations. This is a delegated administrator account provisioned by
        our service. If left unspecified MIAdmin will be used. This is
        different from both the domain administrator and the Directory Services
        Restore Mode (DSRM) administrator.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --authorized-networks=[AUTHORIZED_NETWORKS,...]
        Names of the Google Compute Engine networks to which the domain will be
        connected.

     --enable-audit-logs
        If specified, Active Directory data audit logs are enabled for the
        domain.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
