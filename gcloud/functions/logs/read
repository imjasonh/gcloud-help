        [--min-log-level=MIN_LOG_LEVEL] [--region=REGION]
        [--start-time=START_TIME] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]

DESCRIPTION
    Display log entries produced by Google Cloud Functions.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [NAME]
        Name of the function which logs are to be displayed. If no name is
        specified, logs from all functions are displayed.

FLAGS
     --end-time=END_TIME
        Return only log entries which timestamps are not later than the
        specified time. If --end-time is specified but --start-time is not, the
        command returns --limit latest log entries which appeared before
        --end-time. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
        formats.

     --execution-id=EXECUTION_ID
        Execution ID for which logs are to be displayed.

     --gen2
        If enabled, this command will use Cloud Functions (Second generation).
        If disabled with --no-gen2, Cloud Functions (First generation) will be
        used. If not specified, the value of this flag will be taken from the
        functions/gen2 configuration property. If the functions/gen2
        configuration property is not set, defaults to looking up the given
        function and using its generation.

     --limit=LIMIT; default=20
        Number of log entries to be fetched; must not be greater than 1000.
        Note that the most recent entries in the specified time range are
        returned, rather than the earliest.

     --min-log-level=MIN_LOG_LEVEL
        Minimum level of logs to be fetched. MIN_LOG_LEVEL must be one of:
        debug, info, error.

     --region=REGION
        Only show logs generated by functions in the region. Overrides the
        default functions/region property value for this command invocation.

     --start-time=START_TIME
        Return only log entries in which timestamps are not earlier than the
        specified time. If --start-time is not specified, a default start time
        of 1 week ago is assumed. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information
        on time formats.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
