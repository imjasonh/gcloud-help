NAME
    gcloud workflows run - execute a workflow and wait for the execution to
        complete

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud workflows run (WORKFLOW : --location=LOCATION)
        [--call-log-level=CALL_LOG_LEVEL; default="none"] [--data=DATA]
        [--disable-concurrency-quota-overflow-buffering]
        [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Execute a workflow and wait for the execution to complete.

EXAMPLES
    To execute a workflow named my-workflow with the data that will be passed
    to the workflow, run:

        $ gcloud workflows run my-workflow `--data=my-data`

    To add two labels {foo: bar, baz: qux} to the execution, run:

        $ gcloud workflows run my-workflow `--data=my-data` \
            `--labels=foo=bar,baz=qux`

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Workflow resource - Name of the workflow to execute. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument workflow on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       WORKFLOW
          ID of the workflow or fully qualified identifier for the workflow.

          To set the workflow attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workflow on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Cloud location for the workflow. Alternatively, set the property
          [workflows/location].

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workflow on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property workflows/location.

FLAGS
     --call-log-level=CALL_LOG_LEVEL; default="none"
        Level of call logging to apply during execution. CALL_LOG_LEVEL must be
        one of:

         log-all-calls
            Log all calls to subworkflows or library functions and their
            results.
         log-errors-only
            Log when a call is stopped due to an exception.
         log-none
            Perform no call logging.
         none
            No logging level specified.

     --data=DATA
        JSON string with data that will be passed to the workflow as an
        argument.

     --disable-concurrency-quota-overflow-buffering
        If set, the execution will not be backlogged when the concurrency quota
        is exhausted. Backlogged executions start when the concurrency quota
        becomes available.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.
