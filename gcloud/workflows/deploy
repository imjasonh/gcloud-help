DESCRIPTION
    Create or update a workflow.

EXAMPLES
    To deploy a workflow with source code myWorkflow.yaml on Workflows:

        $ gcloud workflows deploy my-workflow --source=myWorkflow.yaml

    You may also skip waiting for the operation to finish:

        $ gcloud workflows deploy my-workflow --source=myWorkflow.yaml \
            --async

    To specify a service account as the workflow identity:

        $ gcloud workflows deploy my-workflow --source=myWorkflow.yaml \
            --service-account=my-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Workflow resource - Name of the workflow to deploy. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument workflow on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       WORKFLOW
          ID of the workflow or fully qualified identifier for the workflow.

          To set the workflow attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workflow on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Cloud location for the workflow. Alternatively, set the property
          [workflows/location].

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workflow on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property workflows/location.

         none
            No logging level specified.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        The description of the workflow to deploy.

     --execution-history-level=EXECUTION_HISTORY_LEVEL; default="none"

        The service account that should be used as the workflow identity.
        "projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/" prefix may be skipped from the

        prepended to the service account ID.

     --source=SOURCE
        Location of a workflow source code to deploy. Required on first
        deployment. Location needs to be defined as a path to a local file with
