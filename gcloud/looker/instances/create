DESCRIPTION
    Create a new Looker instance.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ An instance with the same name already exists.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to create instances.
      ▪ --async flag is not passed

EXAMPLES
    To create a basic tier instance with the name my-looker-instance in region
    us-central-1 with an edition of "LOOKER_CORE_STANDARD", run:

        $ gcloud looker instances create my-looker-instance \
            --region=us-central1 --edition="core-standard" \
            --oauth-client-id='looker' --oauth-client-secret='looker' \
            --async

    Note: It is recommended that the --async argument is provided when creating
    a Looker instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - Arguments and flags that specify the Looker instance
     you want to create. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
