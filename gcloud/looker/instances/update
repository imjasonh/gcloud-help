DESCRIPTION
    Update the metadata and/or configuration parameters of a Looker instance.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The instance specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to update the given
        instance.

EXAMPLES
    To update the maintenance window to Sunday at 11:00 PM for a Looker
    instance with the name my-looker-instance, run:

        $ gcloud looker instances update my-looker-instance \
            --maintenance-window-day=sunday \
            --maintenance-window-time='23:00' --async

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - Arguments and flags that specify the Looker instance
     you want to update. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance.

          To set the instance attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Looker region of the instance. Overrides the default
          looker/region property value for this command invocation.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property looker/region.

FLAGS
     Email Domain Allowlist for Scheduled Content - Define the email domains to
     which your users can deliver Looker (Google Cloud core) content.

       --allowed-email-domains=[ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS,...]
          This specifies the entire allowed email domain list.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     Custom Domains - Looker (Google Cloud core) lets you serve your
     application through a custom domain. If you use a custom domain, Google
     will provide a managed auto-renewing SSL certificate for security.

     DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to take effect. Your SSL certificate
     will take several minutes to activate. Note that you must get the Type A
     DNS Record from the Google Cloud Console and update with your domain
     registrar for your custom domain to work properly.

       --custom-domain=CUSTOM_DOMAIN
          Domain name wanted to serve the Looker instance.

     --linked-lsp-project-number=LINKED_LSP_PROJECT_NUMBER
        The Looker Studio Pro project number to be linked.

     --public-ip-enabled
        This specifies whether public IP is enabled on the Looker instance.

     User Allocations - There are ten Standard and two Developer users included
     in the cost of the product. You can allocate additional Standard, Viewer,
     and Developer users for this instance. It is an optional step and can be
     modified later.

     With the Standard edition of Looker (Google Cloud core), you can provision
     up to 50 total users, distributed across Viewer, Standard, and Developer.

       --add-developer-users=ADD_DEVELOPER_USERS
          Number of additional Developer Users to allocate to the Looker
          Instance.

       --add-standard-users=ADD_STANDARD_USERS
          Number of additional Standard Users to allocate to the Looker
          Instance.

       --add-viewer-users=ADD_VIEWER_USERS
          Number of additional Viewer Users to allocate to the Looker Instance.

     Private Service Connect - Private Service Connect allows private
     consumption of services across VPC networks that belong to different
     groups, teams, projects, or organizations.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --clear-psc-allowed-vpcs
            Remove all service attachments from the PSC config of the instance.

         --psc-allowed-vpcs=[PSC_ALLOWED_VPCS,...]
            List of VPCs that are allowed ingress into the Looker instance.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --clear-psc-service-attachments
            Remove all service attachments from the PSC config of the instance.

         --psc-service-attachment=[attachment=ATTACHMENT],[domain=DOMAIN]
            The service attachments asigned to the Private Service Connect
            (PSC) config. This flag can be repeated. (Example:
            --psc-service-attachment
            domain="mydomain.com",attachment="projects/my-project/regions/us-east1/serviceAttachments/sa"
            --psc-service-attachments
            domain="mydomain.com",attachment="projects/my-project/regions/us-east1/serviceAttachments/sa")

     Deny Maintanence Period - You must allow at least 48 hours of maintenance
     availability in a 60-day rolling window. Only contiguous availability
     windows of at least two hours are considered. When setting a maintenance
     exclusion please be aware that excluding application upgrades cannot
     exceed 60-days and excluding infrastructure upgrades cannot exceed
     90-days.

       --deny-maintenance-period-end-date=DENY_MAINTENANCE_PERIOD_END_DATE
          End date of the deny maintenance period in format: YYYY-MM-DD

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --deny-maintenance-period-start-date=DENY_MAINTENANCE_PERIOD_START_DATE
          Start date of the deny maintenance period in format: YYYY-MM-DD

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --deny-maintenance-period-time=DENY_MAINTENANCE_PERIOD_TIME

          be specified in 24hr format (ex: 13:00, 17:30, 23:45).

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

     Maintenance Window - Maintenance typically only takes place once every few
     months, and requires your instance to be restarted while updates are made,
     which disrupts service briefly.

       --maintenance-window-day=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY
          Day of the week for the maintenance window, in UTC time zone.
          MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY must be one of: friday, monday, saturday,
          sunday, thursday, tuesday, wednesday.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --maintenance-window-time=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_TIME

          day must be specified in 24hr format (ex: 13:00, 17:30, 23:45).
          Maintenance will be scheduled within 60 minutes. To set the
          maintenance-window-time attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --maintenance-window-time on the command
            line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

     OAuth Application Credentials - Looker Instance OAuth login settings.
     Setup an OAuth app that will allow users to authenticate and access the
     instance. For more information see:

       --oauth-client-id=OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
          The client ID from an external OAuth application.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --oauth-client-secret=OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
          The client secret from an external OAuth application.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.
