SYNOPSIS
    gcloud secrets remove-iam-policy-binding SECRET --member=PRINCIPAL
        --role=ROLE [--location=LOCATION]
        [--all | --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Removes a policy binding from the IAM policy of a secret. One binding
    consists of a member and a role.

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

EXAMPLES
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/viewer' for the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' on the my-secret, run:

        $ gcloud secrets remove-iam-policy-binding my-secret \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/viewer'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Secret resource - Name of the secret from which to remove IAM policy
     binding. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument SECRET on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SECRET
          ID of the secret or fully qualified identifier for the secret.

          To set the secret attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument SECRET on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Deleted principals have an additional deleted: prefix and a ?uid=UID
        suffix, where UID is a unique identifier for the principal. Example:
        deleted:user:test-user@gmail.com?uid=123456789012345678901.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the principal from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     Location resource - The location to remove iam policy. This represents a
     Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     --location=LOCATION
        ID of the location or fully qualified identifier for the location.

        To set the location attribute:
        ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and principal, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding that you want to remove. When the
          condition is explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a
          binding without a condition is removed. Otherwise, only a binding
          with a condition that exactly matches the specified condition
          (including the optional description) is removed. For more on
          conditions, refer to the conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition. Use a full or
          relative path to a local file containing the value of condition.
