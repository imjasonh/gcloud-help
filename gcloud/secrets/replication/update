NAME
    gcloud secrets replication update - update a secret replica's metadata

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud secrets replication update SECRET
        [--remove-cmek | --location=REPLICA-LOCATION --set-kms-key=SET-KMS-KEY]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Update a secret replica's metadata (e.g. cmek policy). This command will
    return an error if given a secret that does not exist or if given a
    location that the given secret doesn't exist in.

    The --remove-kms-key flag is only valid for Secrets that have an automatic
    replication policy or exist in a single location. To remove keys from a
    Secret with multiple user managed replicas, please use the set-replication
    command.

EXAMPLES
    To remove CMEK from a secret called 'my-secret', run:

        $ gcloud secrets replication update my-secret --remove-cmek

    To set the CMEK key on an automatic secret called my-secret to a specified
    KMS key, run:

        $gcloud secrets replication update my-secret
        --set-kms-key=projects/my-project/locations/global/keyRings/my-keyring/cryptoKeys/my-key

    To set the CMEK key on a secret called my-secret to a specified KMS key in
    a specified location in its replication, run:

        $gcloud secrets replication update my-secret
        --set-kms-key=projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/keyRings/my-keyring/cryptoKeys/my-key
        --location=us-central1
