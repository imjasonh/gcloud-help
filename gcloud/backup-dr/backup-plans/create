NAME
    gcloud backup-dr backup-plans create - creates a new Backup Plan

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud backup-dr backup-plans create (BACKUP_PLAN : --location=LOCATION)
        --backup-rule=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...] --backup-vault=BACKUP_VAULT
        --resource-type=RESOURCE_TYPE [--async] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create a new backup plan in the project. It can only be created in
    locations where Backup and DR is available.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new backup plan sample-backup-plan in project sample-project,
    at location us-central1, with resource-type
    compute.<UNIVERSE_DOMAIN>.com/Instance and backup-vault backup-vault with 2
    backup-rules:

    run:

        $ gcloud backup-dr backup-plans create sample-backup-plan \
            --project=sample-project --location=us-central1 \
            --resource-type 'compute.<UNIVERSE_DOMAIN>.com/Instance' \
            --backup-vault <BACKUP-VAULT> --backup-rule <BACKUP-RULE> \
            --backup-rule <BACKUP-RULE>

    Backup Rule Examples:

    1. Hourly backup rule with hourly backup frequency of 6 hours and store it
    for 30 days, and expect the backups to run only between 10:00 to 20:00 UTC

    <BACKUP-RULE>:
    rule-id=sample-hourly-rule,retention-days=30,recurrence=HOURLY,hourly-frequency=6,time-zone=UTC,backup-window-start=10,backup-window-end=20

    Properties:
      ▪ rule-id = "sample-hourly-rule"
      ▪ retention-days = 30
      ▪ recurrence = HOURLY
      ▪ hourly-frequency = 6
      ▪ time-zone = UTC
      ▪ backup-window-start = 10
      ▪ backup-window-end = 20

    2. Daily backup rule with daily backup frequency of 6 hours and store it
    for 7 days

    <BACKUP-RULE>:
    rule-id=sample-daily-rule,retention-days=7,recurrence=DAILY,backup-window-start=1,backup-window-end=14

    Properties:
      ▪ rule-id = "sample-daily-rule"
      ▪ retention-days = 7
      ▪ recurrence = DAILY
      ▪ backup-window-start = 1
      ▪ backup-window-end = 14

    3. Weekly backup rule with weekly backup frequency on every MONDAY & FRIDAY
    and store it for 21 days

    <BACKUP-RULE>:
    rule-id=sample-weekly-rule,retention-days=21,recurrence=WEEKLY,days-of-week="MONDAY
    FRIDAY",backup-window-start=10,backup-window-end=20

    Properties:
      ▪ rule-id = "sample-weekly-rule"
      ▪ retention-days: 21
      ▪ recurrence = WEEKLY
      ▪ days-of-week = "MONDAY FRIDAY"
      ▪ backup-window-start = 10
      ▪ backup-window-end = 20

     backup plan is created, this name can't be changed. The name must be
     unique for a project and location. The arguments in this group can be used
     to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP_PLAN
          ID of the Backup Plan or fully qualified identifier for the Backup
          Plan.

          To set the name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument BACKUP_PLAN on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Backup Plan.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument BACKUP_PLAN on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --backup-rule=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Backup rule that defines parameters for when and how a backup is

        Parameters for the backup rule include:

         rule-id
            Name of the backup rule. The name must be unique and start with a
            lowercase letter followed by up to 62 lowercase letters, numbers,
            or hyphens.

         retention-days
            Duration for which backup data should be retained. It must be
            defined in "days". The value should be greater than or equal to the
            enforced retention period set for the backup vault.

         recurrence
            Frequency for the backup schedule. It must be either: HOURLY,
            DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY or YEARLY.

         backup-window-start
            Start time of the interval during which backup jobs should be
            executed. It can be defined as backup-window-start=2, that means
            backup window starts at 2 a.m. The start time and end time must
            have an interval of 6 hours.

         backup-window-end
            End time of the interval during which backup jobs should be
            executed. It can be defined as backup-window-end=14, that means
            backup window ends at 2 p.m. The start time and end time must have
            an interval of 6 hours.

            Jobs are queued at the beginning of the window and will be marked
            as SKIPPED if they do not start by the end time. Jobs that are in
            progress will not be canceled at the end time.

         time-zone
