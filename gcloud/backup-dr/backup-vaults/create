            --description=DESCRIPTION

    To create a new backup vault BACKUP_VAULT in location MY_LOCATION with
    minimum enforced-retention for backups of 1 day and label key1 with value
    value1, run:

        $ gcloud backup-dr backup-vaults create BACKUP_VAULT \

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup Vault resource - Name of the backup vault to create. A vault name
     cannot be changed after creation. It must be between 3-63 characters long
     and must be unique within the project and location. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument backup_vault on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP_VAULT
          ID of the Backup Vault or fully qualified identifier for the Backup
          Vault.

          To set the name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup_vault on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Backup Vault.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup_vault on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --backup-min-enforced-retention=BACKUP_MIN_ENFORCED_RETENTION
        Backups will be kept for this minimum period before they can be
        deleted. Once the effective time is reached, the enforced retention
        period cannot be decreased or removed. The value must be specified in
        relative time format (e.g. p1d, p1m, p1m1d).

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --access-restriction=ACCESS_RESTRICTION; default="within-org"
        Authorize certain sources and destinations for data being sent into, or
        restored from, the backup vault being created. This choice determines
        the type of resources that can be stored. Restricting access to within
        your project or organization limits the resources to those managed
        through the Google Cloud console (e.g., Compute Engine VMs).
        Unrestricted access is required for resources managed through the
        management console (e.g., VMware Engine VMs, databases, and file
        systems). ACCESS_RESTRICTION must be one of: within-project,
        within-org, unrestricted, within-org-but-unrestricted-for-ba.

     --no-async
        Wait for the operation in progress to complete.

     --backup-retention-inheritance=BACKUP_RETENTION_INHERITANCE
        The inheritance mode for enforced retention end time of the backup
        within this backup vault. Once set, the inheritance mode cannot be
        changed. Default is inherit-vault-retention. If set to
        inherit-vault-retention, the backup retention period will be inherited
        from the backup vault. If set to match-backup-expire-time, the backup
        retention period will be the same as the backup expiration time.
        BACKUP_RETENTION_INHERITANCE must be one of: inherit-vault-retention,
        match-backup-expire-time.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Optional description for the backup vault (2048 characters or less).

     --effective-time=EFFECTIVE_TIME
        The time at which the enforced retention period becomes locked. This
        flag is mutually exclusive with --unlock-backup-min-enforced-retention.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Optional resource labels to represent metadata provided by the user.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
