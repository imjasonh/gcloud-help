        specified, the default hostname is
        [INSTANCE_NAME].c.[TARGET_PROJECT_ID].internal when using the global
        DNS, and [INSTANCE_NAME].[ZONE].c.[TARGET_PROJECT_ID].internal when
        using zonal DNS.

     --instance-kms-key=INSTANCE_KMS_KEY
        The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will be used to
        protect the restored instance.

        Provide the full resource name of the cryptokey in the format:
        projects/<project>/locations/<location>/keyRings/<key-ring>/cryptoKeys/<key>

     --instance-termination-action=INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION
        Specifies the termination action that will be taken upon VM preemption
        (--provisioning-model=SPOT) or automatic instance termination

            The VM can be restarted later.

     --key-revocation-action-type=POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the instance when the KMS key of one of its
        attached disks is revoked. The default is none. POLICY must be one of:
        ◆ none No operation is performed.
        ◆ stop The instance is stopped when the KMS key of one of its
          attached disks is revoked.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --local-ssd-recovery-timeout=LOCAL_SSD_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT
        Specifies the maximum amount of time a Local SSD VM should wait while
        recovery of the Local SSD state is attempted. Its value should be in
        between 0 and 168 hours with hour granularity and the default value
        being 1 hour.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the restored instance. To get a
        list of available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types
        list'. If unspecified, the default type will be based on the source
        instance.

        This can either be the fully qualified path or the name. For example:
        ◆ --machine-type=projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1
        ◆ --machine-type=n1-standard-1

     --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the VMs when their host machines undergo

        MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

         MIGRATE
            The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
            temporarily impact the performance of instances during a migration
            event.
         TERMINATE
            The instances should be terminated.

     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128
        bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for
        all metadata entries is 512 KB.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

            For startup scripts on Windows instances, the following metadata
            keys have special meanings: windows-startup-script-url,
            windows-startup-script-cmd, windows-startup-script-bat,
            windows-startup-script-ps1, sysprep-specialize-script-url,
            sysprep-specialize-script-cmd, sysprep-specialize-script-bat, and
            sysprep-specialize-script-ps1. For more information, see Running
            startup scripts
            (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript).

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        You can find more information on-line:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --min-node-cpu=MIN_NODE_CPU
        Minimum number of virtual CPUs this instance will consume when running
        on a sole-tenant node.

     --network-interface=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a network interface to the instance. This flag can be repeated to
        specify multiple network interfaces. The following keys are allowed:
        network, subnet, private-network-ip, internal-ipv6-address,
        internal-ipv6-prefix-length, address, external-ipv6-address,
        external-ipv6-prefix-length, network-tier, aliases, stack-type,
        queue-count, nic-type, network-attachment

     --network-performance-configs=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Configures network performance settings for the restored instance. If
        this flag is not specified, the restored instance will be created with
        its source instance's network performance configuration.

         total-egress-bandwidth-tier
            Total egress bandwidth is the available outbound bandwidth from a
            VM, regardless of whether the traffic is going to internal IP or
            external IP destinations. The following tier values are allowed:
            [DEFAULT, TIER_1]

     --[no-]preemptible
        If provided, instances will be preemptible and time-limited. Instances
        might be preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and
        will only be able to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible
        instances can not be restarted and will not migrate. Use --preemptible
        to enable and --no-preemptible to disable.

     --private-ipv6-google-access-type=PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE
        The private IPv6 Google access type for the restored VM.
        PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of: inherit-subnetwork,
        enable-bidirectional-access, enable-outbound-vm-access

     --provisioning-model=PROVISIONING_MODEL
        Specifies provisioning model, which determines price, obtainability,
        and runtime for the restored VM instance. PROVISIONING_MODEL must be
        one of:

         SPOT
            Spot VMs are spare capacity; Spot VMs are discounted to have much
            lower prices than standard VMs but have no guaranteed runtime. Spot
            VMs are the new version of preemptible VM instances, except Spot
            VMs do not have a 24-hour maximum runtime.
         STANDARD
            Default. Standard provisioning model for VM instances, which has
            user-controlled runtime but no Spot discounts.

     --resource-manager-tags=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Specifies a list of resource manager tags to apply to the instance.

     --resource-policies=RESOURCE_POLICY,[...]
        A list of resource policy names to be added to the instance. The
        policies must exist in the same region as the instance.

     --[no-]restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user. Use
        --restart-on-failure to enable and --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        A service account is an identity attached to the instance. Its access
        tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and are
        used to authenticate applications on the instance. The account can be
        set using an email address corresponding to the required service
        account. If not provided, the instance will use the project's default
        service account.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instance. These tags allow
        network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1) for more
        details.

     --threads-per-core=THREADS_PER_CORE
        The number of visible threads per physical core. To disable
        simultaneous multithreading (SMT) set this to 1. Valid values are: 1 or
        2.

        For more information about configuring SMT, see:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/configuring-simultaneous-multithreading.

     --visible-core-count=VISIBLE_CORE_COUNT
        The number of physical cores to expose to the instance's guest
        operating system. The number of virtual CPUs visible to the instance's
        guest operating system is this number of cores multiplied by the
        instance's count of visible threads per physical core.

     Specifies the reservation for the instance.

     --reservation=RESERVATION
        The name of the reservation, required when
        --reservation-affinity=specific.

     --reservation-affinity=RESERVATION_AFFINITY
        Specifies the reservation affinity of the instance.
        RESERVATION_AFFINITY must be one of:

         any
            Consume any available, matching reservation.
         none
            Do not consume from any reserved capacity.
         specific
            Must consume from a specific reservation.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,
          described below. However, if neither --scopes nor --no-scopes are
          specified and the project has no default service account, then the
          instance will be created with no scopes. Note that the level of
          access that a service account has is determined by a combination of
          access scopes and IAM roles so you must configure both access scopes
          and IAM roles for the service account to work properly. SCOPE can be
          either the full URI of the scope or an alias. Default scopes are
          assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:
          https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/create#--scopes

       --no-scopes
          Create the instance with no scopes.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
