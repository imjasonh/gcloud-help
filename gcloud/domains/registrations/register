NAME
    gcloud domains registrations register - register a new domain

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud domains registrations register REGISTRATION
        [--contact-data-from-file=CONTACT_DATA_FILE_NAME]
        [--contact-privacy=CONTACT_PRIVACY] [--validate-only]
        [--cloud-dns-zone=CLOUD_DNS_ZONE | --name-servers=NAME_SERVER,...,[...]
          | --use-google-domains-dns] [--async] [--disable-dnssec]
        [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [--notices=[NOTICE,...]]
        [--yearly-price=YEARLY_PRICE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create a new Cloud Domains registration resource by registering a new
    domain. The new resource's ID will be equal to the domain name.

    After this command executes, the resource will be in state
    REGISTRATION_PENDING. The registration process should complete in less than
    5 minutes. After that the resource will be in state ACTIVE. In rare cases
    this process can take much longer due, for example, to a downtime of the
    domain registry.

    Also in rare cases, the domain may end up in state REGISTRATION_FAILED. In
    that case, delete the registration resource and try again.

    When using Cloud DNS Zone DNSSEC will be enabled by default whenever the
    Zone is DNSSEC signed. You can choose to not enable DNSSEC by using the
    --disable-dnssec flag.

EXAMPLES
    To register example.com interactively, run:

        $ gcloud domains registrations register example.com

    To register example.com using contact data from a YAML file contacts.yaml,
    run:

        $ gcloud domains registrations register example.com \
            --contact-data-from-file=contacts.yaml

    To register example.com with interactive prompts disabled, provide
    --contact-data-from-file, --contact-privacy, --yearly-price flags and one
    of the flags for setting authoritative name servers. Sometimes also
    --notices flag is required. For example, run:

        $ gcloud domains registrations register example.com \
            --contact-data-from-file=contacts.yaml \
            --contact-privacy=private-contact-data \
            --yearly-price="12.00 USD" --cloud-dns-zone=example-com --quiet

COMMONLY USED FLAGS
     --contact-data-from-file=CONTACT_DATA_FILE_NAME
        A YAML file containing the contact data for the domain's three
        contacts: registrant, admin, and technical.

     --contact-privacy=CONTACT_PRIVACY
        The contact privacy mode to use. Supported privacy modes depend on the
        domain. CONTACT_PRIVACY must be one of:

         private-contact-data
            (DEPRECATED) Your contact info won't be available to the public. To
            help protect your info and prevent spam, a third party provides
            alternate (proxy) contact info for your domain in the public
            directory at no extra cost. They will forward received messages to
            you. The private-contact-data option is deprecated; See
            https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/deprecations/feature-deprecations.
         public-contact-data
            All the data from contact config is publicly available. To set this
            value, you must also pass the --notices flag with value
            public-contact-data-acknowledgement or agree to the notice
            interactively.
         redacted-contact-data
            Limited personal information will be available to the public. The
            actual information redacted depends on the domain. For more
            information see https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3251242.

     --validate-only
        Don't actually create registration. Only validate arguments.

     Set the authoritative name servers for the given domain.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --cloud-dns-zone=CLOUD_DNS_ZONE
          The name of the Cloud DNS managed-zone to set as the name server for
          the domain. If it's in the same project, you can use short name. If
          not, use the full resource name, e.g.:
          --cloud-dns-zone=projects/example-project/managedZones/example-zone.
          If the zone is signed, DNSSEC will be enabled by default unless you
          pass --disable-dnssec.

       --name-servers=NAME_SERVER,...,[...]
          List of DNS name servers for the domain.

       --use-google-domains-dns
          (REMOVED) Use free name servers provided by Google Domains. If the
          zone is signed, DNSSEC will be enabled by default unless you pass
          --disable-dnssec.

          Flag --use-google-domains-dns has been removed.

OTHER FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --disable-dnssec
        Use this flag to disable DNSSEC, or to skip enabling it when switching
        to a Cloud DNS Zone or Google Domains nameservers.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --notices=[NOTICE,...]
        Notices about special properties of certain domains or contacts. NOTICE
        must be one of:

         public-contact-data-acknowledgement
            By sending this notice you acknowledge that using
            public-contact-data contact privacy makes all the data from contact
            config publicly available.
         hsts-preloaded
            By sending this notice you acknowledge that the domain is preloaded
            on the HTTP Strict Transport Security list in browsers. Serving a
            website on such domain will require an SSL certificate. See
            https://support.google.com/domains/answer/7638036 for details.

     --yearly-price=YEARLY_PRICE
        Accept the domain's yearly price in the interactive flow or by using
        this flag. Use a number followed by a currency code, for example,
        "12.00 USD". Get the price using the get-register-parameters command.
