NAME
    gcloud domains registrations import - import a domain from Google Domains
        registrar to Cloud Domains

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud domains registrations import REGISTRATION [--async]
        [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create a new Cloud Domains registration resource by importing an existing
    domain from Google Domains registrar. The new resource's ID will be equal
    to the domain name.

    After this command executes, a resource is created with state ACTIVE,
    indicating that the import was successful. Cloud Domains will automatically
    renew your domain as long as your Cloud Billing account is active. If this
    command fails, no resource is created.

    Other users may lose access to the domain and will need IAM permissions on
    the Cloud project containing the registration resource to regain access.

EXAMPLES
    To import example.com, run:

        $ gcloud domains registrations import example.com
