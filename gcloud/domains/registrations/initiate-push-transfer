NAME
    gcloud domains registrations initiate-push-transfer - initiates the push
        transfer process

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud domains registrations initiate-push-transfer REGISTRATION [--async]
        [--tag=TAG] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Initiates the Push Transfer process to transfer the domain to another
    registrar. The process might complete instantly or might require
    confirmation or additional work. Check the emails sent to the email address
    of the registrant. The process is aborted after a timeout if it's not
    completed.

    This method is only supported for domains that have the
    REQUIRE_PUSH_TRANSFER property in the list of domain_properties. The domain
    must also be unlocked before it can be transferred to a different
    registrar.

EXAMPLES
    To initiate a push transfer for example.co.uk, run:

        $ gcloud domains registrations initiate-push-transfer \
            example.co.uk --tag=NEW_REGISTRY_TAG
