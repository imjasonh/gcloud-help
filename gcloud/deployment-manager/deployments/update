NAME
    gcloud deployment-manager deployments update - update a deployment based on
        a provided config file

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud deployment-manager deployments update DEPLOYMENT_NAME [--async]
        [--create-policy=CREATE_POLICY; default="create-or-acquire"]
        [--delete-policy=DELETE_POLICY; default="delete"]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--fingerprint=FINGERPRINT] [--preview]
        [--properties=[PROPERTIES,...]] [--remove-labels=[KEY,...]]
        [--update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--composite-type=COMPOSITE_TYPE | --config=CONFIG
          | --template=TEMPLATE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command will update a deployment with the new config file provided.
    Different policies for create, update, and delete policies can be
    specified.

EXAMPLES
    To update an existing deployment with a new config YAML file, run:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config=new_config.yaml

    To update an existing deployment with a new config template file, run:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --template=new_config.{jinja|py}

    To update an existing deployment with a composite type as a new config,
    run:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --composite-type=<project-id>/composite:<new-config>

    To preview an update to an existing deployment without actually modifying
    the resources, run:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config=new_config.yaml --preview

    To apply an update that has been previewed, provide the name of the
    previewed deployment, and no config file:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment

    To specify different create, update, or delete policies, include any subset
    of the following flags:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config=new_config.yaml --create-policy=acquire \
            --delete-policy=abandon

    To perform an update without waiting for the operation to complete, run:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config=new_config.yaml --async

    To update an existing deployment with a new config file and a fingerprint,
    run:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-deployment \
            --config=new_config.yaml --fingerprint=deployment-fingerprint

    Either the --config, --template, or --composite-type flag is required
    unless launching an already-previewed update to a deployment. If you want
    to update a deployment's metadata, such as the labels or description, you
    must run a separate command with --update-labels, --remove-labels, or
    --description, as applicable.

    More information is available at
    https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/deployments/updating-deployments.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DEPLOYMENT_NAME
        Deployment name.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --create-policy=CREATE_POLICY; default="create-or-acquire"
        Create policy for resources that have changed in the update.
        CREATE_POLICY must be one of: acquire, create-or-acquire.

     --delete-policy=DELETE_POLICY; default="delete"
        Delete policy for resources that will change as part of an update or
        delete. delete deletes the resource while abandon just removes the
        resource reference from the deployment. DELETE_POLICY must be one of:
        abandon, delete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        The new description of the deployment.

     --fingerprint=FINGERPRINT
        The fingerprint to use in requests to modify a deployment. If not
        specified, a get deployment request will be made to fetch the latest
        fingerprint. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that is part
        of the update, stop, and cancel-preview request to perform optimistic
        locking. It is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes
        after every request to modify data. The latest fingerprint is printed
        when deployment data is modified.

     --preview
        Preview the requested update without making any changes to the
        underlying resources. (default=False)

     --properties=[PROPERTIES,...]
        A comma separated, key:value, map to be used when deploying a template
        file or composite type directly.

     --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
        List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is silently
        ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then --update-labels is
        applied first.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --composite-type=COMPOSITE_TYPE
          Name of a composite type to deploy. For an example of creating and
          deploying a composite type, see:
          https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/configuration/templates/create-composite-types#examplecompositetype

       --config=CONFIG
          Filename of a top-level yaml config that specifies resources to
          deploy. For a guide to creating a configuration, refer to
          https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/configuration/create-basic-configuration

       --template=TEMPLATE
          Filename of a top-level jinja or python config template.
