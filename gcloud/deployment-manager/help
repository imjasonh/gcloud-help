NAME
    gcloud deployment-manager - manage deployments of cloud resources

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud deployment-manager GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The gcloud deployment-manager command group lets you manage the deployment
    of Google Cloud Platform resources using Google Cloud Deployment Manager.

    Google Cloud Deployment Manager allows you to specify all the resources
    needed for your application in a declarative format using YAML. You can
    also use Python or Jinja2 templates to parameterize the configuration and
    allow reuse of common deployment paradigms such as a load balanced,
    auto-scaled instance group.
