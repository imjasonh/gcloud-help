NAME
    gcloud ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding - remove IAM policy
        binding for a model

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding MODEL
        --member=PRINCIPAL --role=ROLE [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Removes a policy binding from an AI Platform Model. One binding consists of
    a member, a role and an optional condition. See $ gcloud ai-platform models
    get-iam-policy for examples of how to specify a model resource.

EXAMPLES
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' for the
    user 'test-user@gmail.com' on model with identifier 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding my_model \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/ml.admin'

    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' from all
    authenticated users on model 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding my_model \
            --member='allAuthenticatedUsers' --role='roles/ml.admin'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.
