SYNOPSIS
    gcloud apigee products COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Manage Apigee API products.

    gcloud apigee products manipulates API products. These are collections of
    deployed API resources, combined with quota settings and metadata, used to
    deliver customized and productized API bundles to the developer community.

EXAMPLES
    To list all API products in the active Cloud Platform project, run:

        $ gcloud apigee products list

    To create an API product named my-apis by answering interactive prompts
    about its included proxies and access policies, run:

        $ gcloud apigee products create my-apis

    To create an API product named prod-apis that makes every API proxy
    deployed to the prod environment publicly available, run:

        $ gcloud apigee products create prod-apis --environments=prod \
          --all-proxies --public-access

    To get a JSON object describing an existing API product, run:

        $ gcloud apigee products describe PRODUCT_NAME \
          --organization=ORG_NAME --format=json

    To add another API proxy to an existing API product, run:

        $ gcloud apigee products update PRODUCT_NAME --add-api=API_NAME

    To edit the publicly visible name and description of an API product, run:

        $ gcloud apigee products update PRODUCT_NAME \
          --display-name="New Name" \
          --description="A new description of this product."

    To make an existing product publicly visible and automatically allow
    developers access to it, run:

        $ gcloud apigee products update PRODUCT_NAME --public-access \
          --automatic-approval

    To delete an existing API product, run:

        $ gcloud apigee products delete PRODUCT_NAME
