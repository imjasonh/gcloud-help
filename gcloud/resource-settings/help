DESCRIPTION

    their Google Cloud Platform resources, such as virtual machines, firewalls,
    projects, and so forth. Settings can be attached to organizations, folders,
    and projects, and can influence these resources as well as service
    resources that are descendants of the resource to which the settings are
    attached.
