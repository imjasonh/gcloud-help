SYNOPSIS
    gcloud resource-settings COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (DEPRECATED) Create and manage Resource Settings.

    Resource Settings is deprecated. As of November 7, 2023, no organizations
    will be onboarded for any of the enabled settings, and the service will be
    shut down on October 1, 2024.

    The gcloud Resource Settings command group lets you create and manipulate

    The Resource Settings Service is a hierarchy-aware service with a

    their Google Cloud Platform resources, such as virtual machines, firewalls,
    projects, and so forth. Settings can be attached to organizations, folders,
    and projects, and can influence these resources as well as service
    resources that are descendants of the resource to which the settings are
    attached.
