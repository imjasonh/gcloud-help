NAME
    gcloud transfer agents delete - delete Transfer Service transfer agents

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud transfer agents delete [--ids=[IDS,...] | --all | --uninstall]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete Transfer Service agents from your machine.

EXAMPLES
    If you plan to delete specific agents, you can list which agents are
    running on your machine by running:

        $ docker container list --all \
            --filter ancestor=gcr.io/cloud-ingest/tsop-agent

    Then run:

        $ gcloud transfer agents delete --ids=id1,id2,...

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --ids=[IDS,...]
          The IDs of the agents you want to delete. Separate multiple agent IDs
          with commas, with no spaces following the commas.

       --all
          Delete all agents running on your machine.

       --uninstall
          Fully uninstall the agent container image in addition to deleting the
          agents. Uninstalling the container image will free up space, but
          you'll need to reinstall it to run agents on this machine in the
          future.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer agents delete
