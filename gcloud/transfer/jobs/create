DESCRIPTION
    Create a Transfer Service transfer job, allowing you to transfer data to
    Google Cloud Storage on a one-time or recurring basis.

EXAMPLES
    To create a one-time, immediate transfer job to move data from Google Cloud
    Storage bucket "foo" into the "baz" folder in Cloud Storage bucket "bar",
    run:

        $ gcloud transfer jobs create gs://foo gs://bar/baz/

    To create a transfer job to move data from an Amazon S3 bucket called "foo"
    to a Google Cloud Storage bucket named "bar" that runs every day with
    custom name "my-test-job", run:

        $ gcloud transfer jobs create s3://foo gs://bar --name=my-test-job \
            --source-creds-file=/examplefolder/creds.txt \
            --schedule-repeats-every=1d

    To create a one-time, immediate transfer job to move data between Google
    Cloud Storage buckets "foo" and "bar" with filters to include objects that
    start with prefixes "baz" and "qux"; and objects modified in the 24 hours
    before the transfer started, run:

        $ gcloud transfer jobs create gs://foo gs://bar/ \
            --include-prefixes=baz,qux --include-modified-after-relative=1d

    To create a one-time, immediate transfer job to move data from a directory
    with absolute path "/foo/bar/" in the filesystem associated with agent pool
    "my-pool" into Google Cloud Storage bucket "example-bucket", run:

        $ gcloud transfer jobs create posix:///foo/bar/ \
            gs://example-bucket --source-agent-pool=my-pool

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SOURCE
        The source of your data. Available sources and formatting information:

        Public clouds -
        ◆ [Google Cloud Storage] gs://example-bucket/example-folder/
        ◆ [Amazon S3] s3://examplebucket/example-folder
        ◆ [Azure Blob Storage or Data Lake Storage]
          http://examplestorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/examplecontainer/examplefolder

        POSIX filesystem - Specify the posix:// scheme followed by the absolute
        path to the desired directory, starting from the root of the host
        machine (denoted by a leading slash). For example:
        ◆ posix:///path/directory/

        A file transfer agent must be installed on the POSIX filesystem, and
        you need an agent pool flag on this jobs command to activate the agent.

        Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) - Specify the hdfs:// scheme
        followed by the absolute path to the desired directory, starting from
        the root of the file system (denoted by a leading slash). For example:
        ◆ hdfs:///path/directory/

        Namenode details should not be included in the path specification, as
        they are required separately during the agent installation process.

        A file transfer agent must be installed, and you need an agent pool
        flag on this jobs command to activate the agent.

        Publicly-accessible objects - Specify the URL of a TSV file containing
        a list of URLs of publicly-accessible objects. For example:
        ◆ http://example.com/tsvfile

     DESTINATION
        The destination of your transferred data. Available destinations and
        formatting information:

        Google Cloud Storage - Specify the gs:// scheme; name of the bucket;
        and, if transferring to a folder, the path to the folder. For example:
        ◆ gs://example-bucket/example-folder/

        POSIX filesystem - Specify the posix:// scheme followed by the absolute
        path to the desired directory, starting from the root of the host
        machine (denoted by a leading slash). For example:
        ◆ posix:///path/directory/

        A file transfer agent must be installed on the POSIX filesystem, and
        you need an agent pool flag on this jobs command to activate the agent.

FLAGS
     JOB INFORMATION

       --name=NAME
          A unique identifier for the job. Referring to your source and
          destination is recommended. If left blank, the name is auto-generated
          upon submission of the job.

       --description=DESCRIPTION
          An optional description to help identify the job using details that
          don't fit in its name.

       --source-creds-file=SOURCE_CREDS_FILE
          Path to a local file on your machine that includes credentials for an
          Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage source (not required for Google Cloud
          Storage sources). If not specified for an S3 source, gcloud will
          check your system for an AWS config file. However, this flag must be
          specified to use AWS's "role_arn" auth service. For formatting, see:

          S3:
          https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/reference/rest/v1/TransferSpec#AwsAccessKey
          Note: Be sure to put quotations around the JSON value strings.

          Azure:
          https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/reference/rest/v1/TransferSpec#AzureCredentials

       --source-agent-pool=SOURCE_AGENT_POOL
          If using a POSIX filesystem source, specify the ID of the agent pool
          associated with source filesystem.

       --destination-agent-pool=DESTINATION_AGENT_POOL
          If using a POSIX filesystem destination, specify the ID of the agent
          pool associated with destination filesystem.

       --intermediate-storage-path=INTERMEDIATE_STORAGE_PATH
          If transferring between filesystems, specify the path to a folder in
          a Google Cloud Storage bucket (gs://example-bucket/example-folder) to
          use as intermediary storage. Recommended: Use an empty folder
          reserved for this transfer job to ensure transferred data doesn't
          interact with any of your existing Cloud Storage data.

       --manifest-file=MANIFEST_FILE
          Path to a .csv file containing a list of files to transfer from your
          source. For manifest files in Cloud Storage, specify the absolute
          path (e.g., gs://mybucket/manifest.csv). For manifest files stored in
          a source or destination POSIX file system, provide the relative path
          (e.g., source://path/to/manfest.csv or
          destination://path/to/manifest.csv). For manifest file formatting,
          see https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/manifest.

     REPLICATION OPTIONS

       --replication
          Enable replication to automatically copy all new and existing objects
          from the source to the destination. Note: Objects deleted from the
          source bucket will not be deleted from the destination bucket. Please
          note that it is an event-driven transfer.

     EVENT STREAM

     Configure an event stream to transfer data whenever it is added or changed
     at your source, enabling you to act on the data in near real time. This
     event-driven transfer execution mode is available for transfers from
     Google Cloud Storage and Amazon S3. For formatting information, see
     https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/datetimes.

       --event-stream-name=EVENT_STREAM_NAME
          Specify an event stream that Storage Transfer Service can use to
          listen for when objects are created or updated. For Google Cloud
          Storage sources, specify a Cloud Pub/Sub subscription, using format
          "projects/yourproject/subscriptions/yoursubscription". For Amazon S3
          sources, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Simple
          Queue Service (SQS) queue using format
          "arn:aws:sqs:region:account_id:queue_name".

       --event-stream-starts=EVENT_STREAM_STARTS
          Set when to start listening for events UTC using the
          %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z datetime format (e.g.,
          2020-04-12T06:42:12+04:00). If not set, the job will start running
          and listening for events upon the successful submission of the create
          job command.

       --event-stream-expires=EVENT_STREAM_EXPIRES
          Set when to stop listening for events UTC using the
          %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z datetime format (e.g.,
          2020-04-12T06:42:12+04:00). If not set, the job will continue running
          and listening for events indefinitely.

     SCHEDULE

     A job's schedule determines when and how often the job will run. For
     formatting information, see
     https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/datetimes.

       --do-not-run
          Disable default Transfer Service behavior of running job upon
          creation if no schedule is set. If this flag is specified, the job
          won't run until an operation is manually started or a schedule is
          added.

       --schedule-starts=SCHEDULE_STARTS
          Set when the job will start using the %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z datetime
          format (e.g., 2020-04-12T06:42:12+04:00). If not set, the job will
          run upon the successful submission of the create job command unless
          the --do-not-run flag is included.

       --schedule-repeats-every=SCHEDULE_REPEATS_EVERY
          Set the frequency of the job using the absolute duration format
          (e.g., 1 month is p1m; 1 hour 30 minutes is 1h30m). If not set, the
          job will run once.

       --schedule-repeats-until=SCHEDULE_REPEATS_UNTIL
          Set when the job will stop recurring using the %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z
          datetime format (e.g., 2020-04-12T06:42:12+04:00). If specified, you
          must also include a value for the --schedule-repeats-every flag. If
          not specified, the job will continue to repeat as specified in its
          repeat-every field unless the job is manually disabled or you add
          this field later.

     OBJECT CONDITIONS

     A set of conditions to determine which objects are transferred. For
     time-based object condition formatting tips, see
     https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/datetimes. Note: If
     you specify multiple conditions, objects must have at least one of the
     specified 'include' prefixes and all of the specified time conditions. If
     an object has an 'exclude' prefix, it will be excluded even if it matches
     other conditions.

       --include-prefixes=[INCLUDED_PREFIXES,...]
          Include only objects that start with the specified prefix(es).
          Separate multiple prefixes with commas, omitting spaces after the
          commas (e.g., --include-prefixes=foo,bar).

       --exclude-prefixes=[EXCLUDED_PREFIXES,...]
          Exclude any objects that start with the prefix(es) entered. Separate
          multiple prefixes with commas, omitting spaces after the commas
          (e.g., --exclude-prefixes=foo,bar).

       --include-modified-before-absolute=INCLUDE_MODIFIED_BEFORE_ABSOLUTE
          Include objects last modified before an absolute date/time. Ex. by
          specifying '2020-01-01', the transfer would include objects last
          modified before January 1, 2020. Use the %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z datetime
          format.

       --include-modified-after-absolute=INCLUDE_MODIFIED_AFTER_ABSOLUTE
          Include objects last modified after an absolute date/time. Ex. by
          specifying '2020-01-01', the transfer would include objects last
          modified after January 1, 2020. Use the %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z datetime
          format.

       --include-modified-before-relative=INCLUDE_MODIFIED_BEFORE_RELATIVE
          Include objects that were modified before a relative date/time in the
          past. Ex. by specifying a duration of '10d', the transfer would
          include objects last modified more than 10 days before its start
          time. Use the absolute duration format (ex. 1m for 1 month; 1h30m for
          1 hour 30 minutes).

       --include-modified-after-relative=INCLUDE_MODIFIED_AFTER_RELATIVE
          Include objects that were modified after a relative date/time in the
          past. Ex. by specifying a duration of '10d', the transfer would
          include objects last modified less than 10 days before its start
          time. Use the absolute duration format (ex. 1m for 1 month; 1h30m for
          1 hour 30 minutes).

     TRANSFER OPTIONS

       --overwrite-when=OVERWRITE_WHEN
          Determine when destination objects are overwritten by source objects.
          Options include:
          ▸ 'different' - Overwrites files with the same name if the contents
            are different (e.g., if etags or checksums don't match)
          ▸ 'always' - Overwrite destination file whenever source file has
            the same name -- even if they're identical
          ▸ 'never' - Never overwrite destination file when source file has
            the same name

          OVERWRITE_WHEN must be one of: always, different, never.

       --delete-from=DELETE_FROM
          By default, transfer jobs won't delete any data from your source or
          destination. These options enable you to delete data if needed for
          your use case. Options include:
          ▸ 'destination-if-unique' - Delete files from destination if
            they're not also at source. Use to sync destination to source
            (i.e., make destination match source exactly)
          ▸ 'source-after-transfer' - Delete files from source after they're
            transferred

          DELETE_FROM must be one of: destination-if-unique,
          source-after-transfer.

       --preserve-metadata=[METADATA_FIELDS,...]
          Specify object metadata values that can optionally be preserved.
          Example: --preserve-metadata=storage-class,uid

          For more info, see:
          https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/metadata-preservation.

          METADATA_FIELDS must be one of: acl, gid, kms-key, mode,
          storage-class, symlink, temporary-hold, time-created, uid.

       --custom-storage-class=CUSTOM_STORAGE_CLASS
          Specifies the storage class to set on objects being transferred to
          Cloud Storage buckets. If unspecified, the objects' storage class is
          set to the destination bucket default. Valid values are:

          ▸ Any of the values listed in the Cloud Storage documentation:
            Available storage classes
            (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes#classes).
          ▸ preserve - Preserves each object's original storage class. Only
            supported for transfers between Cloud Storage buckets.

          Custom storage class settings are ignored if the destination bucket
          is Autoclass-enabled
          (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/autoclass). Objects
          transferred into Autoclass-enabled buckets are initially set to the
          STANDARD storage class.

     NOTIFICATION CONFIG

     A configuration for receiving notifications oftransfer operation status
     changes via Cloud Pub/Sub.

       --notification-pubsub-topic=NOTIFICATION_PUBSUB_TOPIC
          Pub/Sub topic used for notifications.

       --notification-event-types=[EVENT_TYPES,...]
          Define which change of transfer operation status will trigger Pub/Sub
          notifications. Choices include 'success', 'failed', 'aborted'. To
          trigger notifications for all three status changes, you can leave
          this flag unspecified as long as you've specified a topic for the
          --notification-pubsub-topic flag. EVENT_TYPES must be one of:
          success, failed, aborted.

       --notification-payload-format=NOTIFICATION_PAYLOAD_FORMAT
          If 'none', no transfer operation details are included with
          notifications. If 'json', a json representation of the relevant
          transfer operation is included in notification messages (e.g., to see
          errors after an operation fails). NOTIFICATION_PAYLOAD_FORMAT must be
          one of: json, none.

     LOGGING CONFIG

     Configure which transfer actions and action states are reported when logs
     are generated for this job. Logs can be viewed by running the following
     command: gcloud logging read "resource.type=storage_transfer_job"

       --[no-]enable-posix-transfer-logs
          Sets whether to generate logs for transfers with a POSIX filesystem
          source. This setting will later be merged with other log
          configurations. Use --enable-posix-transfer-logs to enable and
          --no-enable-posix-transfer-logs to disable.

       --log-actions=[LOG_ACTIONS,...]
          Define the transfer operation actions to report in logs. Separate
          multiple actions with commas, omitting spaces after the commas (e.g.,
          --log-actions=find,copy). LOG_ACTIONS must be one of: copy, delete,
          find.

       --log-action-states=[LOG_ACTION_STATES,...]
          The states in which the actions specified in --log-actions are
          logged. Separate multiple states with a comma, omitting the space
          after the comma (e.g., --log-action-states=succeeded,failed).
          LOG_ACTION_STATES must be one of: failed, skipped, succeeded.

     ADDITIONAL OPTIONS

       --source-endpoint=SOURCE_ENDPOINT
          For transfers from S3-compatible sources, specify your storage
          system's endpoint. Check with your provider for formatting (ex.
          s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com for Amazon S3).

       --source-signing-region=SOURCE_SIGNING_REGION
          For transfers from S3-compatible sources, specify a region for
          signing requests. You can leave this unspecified if your storage
          provider doesn't require a signing region.

       --source-auth-method=SOURCE_AUTH_METHOD
          For transfers from S3-compatible sources, choose a process for adding
          authentication information to S3 API requests. Refer to AWS's SigV4
          (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)
          and SigV2
          (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-2.html)
          documentation for more information. SOURCE_AUTH_METHOD must be one
          of: AWS_SIGNATURE_V2, AWS_SIGNATURE_V4.

       --source-list-api=SOURCE_LIST_API
          For transfers from S3-compatible sources, choose the version of the
          S3 listing API for returning objects from the bucket. Refer to AWS's
          ListObjectsV2
          (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html)
          and ListObjects
          (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjects.html)
          documentation for more information. SOURCE_LIST_API must be one of:
          LIST_OBJECTS, LIST_OBJECTS_V2.

       --source-network-protocol=SOURCE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL

          agents should use for this job. SOURCE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL must be one
          of: HTTP, HTTPS.

       --source-request-model=SOURCE_REQUEST_MODEL
          For transfers from S3-compatible sources, choose which addressing
          style to use. Determines if the bucket name is in the hostname or
          part of the URL. For example,
          https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/key-name for path style
          and Ex. https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key-name for
          virtual-hosted style. SOURCE_REQUEST_MODEL must be one of:
          PATH_STYLE, VIRTUAL_HOSTED_STYLE.

       --s3-cloudfront-domain=S3_CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN
          For transfers from S3, optionally route egress traffic through a
          CloudFront instance. Supply the endpoint of the CloudFront instance:
          https://example.cloudfront.net. See documentation
          (https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/s3-cloudfront) for
          more information.

     EXECUTION OPTIONS

       --no-async
          For jobs set to run upon creation, this flag blocks other tasks in
          your terminal until the job's initial, immediate transfer operation
          has completed. If not included, tasks will run asynchronously.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
