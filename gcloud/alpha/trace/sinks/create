NAME
    gcloud alpha trace sinks create - creates a sink

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha trace sinks create SINK_NAME DESTINATION [--project=PROJECT]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates a sink used to export trace spans to a destination.

    The sink's destination must be a BigQuery dataset. The destination must
    already exist. The identity created with the sink will need permission to
    write to the destination dataset. After creating a sink look for the
    [writer_identity] to be populated in the response. With that identity run
    the following command to give it permission:

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding {bigquery_project_id} \ --member
    serviceAccount:{writer_identity from trace_sink} \ --role
    roles/bigquery.dataEditor

    You may also find an existing writer identity by describing a sink.

    It may take several minutes before trace spans are exported after the sink
    is created.

EXAMPLES
        $ gcloud alpha trace sinks create my-sink \
            bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/my_dataset

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name for the sink.

     DESTINATION
        The destination must be a fully qualified BigQuery resource name. The
        destination can be for the same Google Cloud project or for a different
        Google Cloud project in the same organization.

FLAGS
     --project=PROJECT
        Create a sink associated with this project. This will override the
        default project.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
