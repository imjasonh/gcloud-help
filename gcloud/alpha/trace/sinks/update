SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha trace sinks update SINK_NAME DESTINATION [--project=PROJECT]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) / Changes the [destination] associated with a sink. The new
    destination must already exist and Stackdriver Trace must have permission
    to write to it.

        Trace spans are exported to the new destination in a few minutes.

EXAMPLES
    /

        $ gcloud alpha trace sinks update my-sink \
        bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/\
        my_new_dataset

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name of the sink to update.

     DESTINATION
        The new destination for the sink. The destination must be a fully
        qualified BigQuery resource name. The destination can be for the same
        Google Cloud project or for a different Google Cloud project in the
        same organization.

FLAGS
     --project=PROJECT
        Update a sink associated with this project. This will override the
        default project.

    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
