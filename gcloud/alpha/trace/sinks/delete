NAME
    gcloud alpha trace sinks delete - deletes a sink

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha trace sinks delete SINK_NAME [--project=PROJECT]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) / Deletes a sink and halts the export of traces associated with
    that sink. Deleting a sink does not affect traces already exported through
    the deleted sink, and will not affect other sinks that are exporting the
    same traces.

EXAMPLES
    /

        $ gcloud alpha trace sinks delete my-sink

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name of the sink to delete.

FLAGS
     --project=PROJECT
        Delete a sink associated with this project. This will override the
        default project.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
