POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Mirroring endpoint group association resource - Mirroring Endpoint Group
     Association. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument MIRRORING_ENDPOINT_GROUP_ASSOCIATION on the
        command line with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       MIRRORING_ENDPOINT_GROUP_ASSOCIATION
          ID of the mirroring endpoint group association or fully qualified
          identifier for the mirroring endpoint group association.

          To set the endpoint-group-association-id attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument MIRRORING_ENDPOINT_GROUP_ASSOCIATION on the
            command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="20m"
        Time to synchronously wait for the operation to complete, after which
        the operation continues asynchronously. Ignored if --no-async isn't
        specified. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
        formats.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud network-security mirroring-endpoint-group-associations \
            delete

        $ gcloud beta network-security \
            mirroring-endpoint-group-associations delete
