SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha network-security security-profiles threat-prevention
        delete-override
        (SECURITY_PROFILE : --location=LOCATION --organization=ORGANIZATION)
        (--antivirus=[PROTOCOL,...] | --severities=[SEVERITY_LEVEL,...]
          | --threat-ids=[THREAT-ID,...]) [--async]
        [--update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--clear-labels | --remove-labels=[KEY,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) To delete existing antivirus, severities, or threat-ids of threat
    prevention profile. Check the updates of update-override command by using
    gcloud network-security security-profiles threat-prevention list-override
    my-security-profile.

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

        $ gcloud alpha network-security security-profiles \
            threat-prevention delete-override my-security-profile \
            --severities=MEDIUM

    my-security-profile is the name of the Security Profile in the format
    organizations/{organizationID}/locations/{location}/securityProfiles/
    {security_profile_id} where organizationID is the organization ID to which
    the changes should apply, location - global specified and
    security_profile_id the Security Profile Identifier

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --antivirus=[PROTOCOL,...]
          List of comma-separated protocols where each value in the list
          indicates the protocol of the antivirus threat.

       --severities=[SEVERITY_LEVEL,...]
          List of comma-separated severities where each value in the list
          indicates the severity of the threat.

       --threat-ids=[THREAT-ID,...]
          List of comma-separated threat identifiers where each identifier in
          the list is a vendor-specified Signature ID representing a threat
          type.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is False.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha network-security security-profiles \
                threat-prevention delete-override --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud alpha network-security security-profiles \
                threat-prevention delete-override --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.

    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud network-security security-profiles threat-prevention \
            delete-override

        $ gcloud beta network-security security-profiles threat-prevention \
            delete-override
