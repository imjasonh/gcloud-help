DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a mirroring deployment. Successful creation of a deployment
    results in a deployment in ACTIVE state. Check the progress of deployment
    creation by using gcloud network-security mirroring-deployments list.

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create a mirroring deployment called my-deployment, in project ID
    my-project and zone us-central1-a, run:        $ gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-deployments create \
            my-deployment --project=my-project --location=us-central1-a \
            --deployment-group-location=global \
            --forwarding-rule=my-forwarding-rule \
            --forwarding-rule-location=us-central1 \
            --mirroring-deployment-group=my-deployment-group

    OR

        $ gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-deployments create \
            my-deployment --project=my-project --location=us-central1-a \
            --forwarding-rule=projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/\

    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta network-security mirroring-deployments create
