NAME
    gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-endpoint-groups create - create a
        Mirroring Endpoint Group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-endpoint-groups create
        (MIRRORING_ENDPOINT_GROUP : --location=LOCATION)
        (--mirroring-deployment-group=MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP
          : --mirroring-deployment-group-location=MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_LOCATION)
        [--async] [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="20m"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a mirroring endpoint group. Successful creation of an
    endpoint group results in an endpoint group in ACTIVE state. Check the
    progress of endpoint group creation by using gcloud network-security
    mirroring-endpoint-groups list.

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create a mirroring endpoint group called my-endpoint-group, in project
    ID my-project, run:        $ gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-endpoint-groups create \
            my-endpoint-group --project=my-project --location=global \
            --mirroring-deployment-group=my-deployment-group

    OR

        $ gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-endpoint-groups create \
            my-endpoint-group --project=my-project --location=global \
            --mirroring-deployment-group=projects/my-project/locations/\
        global/mirroringDeploymentGroups/my-deployment-group

    OR

        $ gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-endpoint-groups create \
            projects/my-project/locations/global/mirroringEndpointGroups/\
        my-endpoint-group \
            --mirroring-deployment-group=projects/my-project/locations/\
        global/mirroringDeploymentGroups/my-deployment-group

    OR

        $ gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-endpoint-groups create \
            my-endpoint-group --project=my-project --location=global \
            --mirroring-deployment-group=projects/my-project/locations/\
        global/mirroringDeploymentGroups/my-deployment-group \

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Mirroring endpoint group resource - Mirroring Endpoint Group. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument MIRRORING_ENDPOINT_GROUP on the command line
        with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       MIRRORING_ENDPOINT_GROUP
          ID of the mirroring endpoint group or fully qualified identifier for
          the mirroring endpoint group.

          To set the endpoint-group-id attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument MIRRORING_ENDPOINT_GROUP on the command
            line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the mirroring endpoint group.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument MIRRORING_ENDPOINT_GROUP on the command line
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Mirroring deployment group resource - Mirroring Deployment Group. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --mirroring-deployment-group on the command line
        with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;

     This must be specified.

       --mirroring-deployment-group=MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP
          ID of the mirroring deployment group or fully qualified identifier
          for the mirroring deployment group.

          To set the id attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --mirroring-deployment-group on the command
            line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --mirroring-deployment-group-location=MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_LOCATION
          Location of the mirroring deployment group.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --mirroring-deployment-group on the command
            line with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --mirroring-deployment-group-location on the
            command line;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ provide the argument MIRRORING_ENDPOINT_GROUP on the command line
            with a fully specified name.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the endpoint

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="20m"
        Time to synchronously wait for the operation to complete, after which
        the operation continues asynchronously. Ignored if --no-async isn't
        specified. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
        formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud network-security mirroring-endpoint-groups create

        $ gcloud beta network-security mirroring-endpoint-groups create
