    gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-deployment-groups create - create a
        Mirroring Deployment Group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-deployment-groups create
        (MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP : --location=LOCATION) --network=NETWORK
        [--async] [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="20m"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a mirroring deployment group. Successful creation of a
    deployment group results in a deployment group in ACTIVE state. Check the
    progress of deployment group creation by using gcloud network-security
    mirroring-deployment-groups list.

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create a mirroring deployment group called my-deployment-group, in
    project ID my-project, run:        $ gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-deployment-groups create \
            my-deployment-group --project=my-project --location=global \
            --network=my-network

    OR

        $ gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-deployment-groups create \
            my-deployment-group --project=my-project --location=global \
            --network=projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network

    OR

        $ gcloud alpha network-security mirroring-deployment-groups create \
            projects/my-project/locations/global/mirroringDeploymentGroups/\
        my-deployment-group \
            --network=projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Mirroring deployment group resource - Mirroring Deployment Group. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP on the command line
        with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP
          ID of the mirroring deployment group or fully qualified identifier
          for the mirroring deployment group.

          To set the deployment-group-id attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP on the command
            line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the mirroring deployment group.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP on the command
            line with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Network resource - Mirroring Deployment Group. This represents a Cloud
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --network on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       --network=NETWORK
          ID of the network or fully qualified identifier for the network.

          To set the network-name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --network on the command line.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="20m"
        Time to synchronously wait for the operation to complete, after which
        the operation continues asynchronously. Ignored if --no-async isn't
        specified. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
        formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:
