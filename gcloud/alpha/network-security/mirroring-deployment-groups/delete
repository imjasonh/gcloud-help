POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Mirroring deployment group resource - Mirroring Deployment Group. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP on the command line
        with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP
          ID of the mirroring deployment group or fully qualified identifier
          for the mirroring deployment group.

          To set the deployment-group-id attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument MIRRORING_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP on the command
            line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="20m"
        Time to synchronously wait for the operation to complete, after which
        the operation continues asynchronously. Ignored if --no-async isn't
        specified. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
        formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud network-security mirroring-deployment-groups delete

        $ gcloud beta network-security mirroring-deployment-groups delete
