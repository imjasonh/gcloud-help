DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a new AlloyDB cluster within a given project.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new cluster, run:

        $ gcloud alpha alloydb clusters create my-cluster \
            --region=us-central1 --password=postgres

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CLUSTER
        AlloyDB cluster ID

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --password=PASSWORD
        Initial postgres user password to set up during cluster creation.

     --region=REGION

        regions at https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/instance-locations.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --allocated-ip-range-name=ALLOCATED_IP_RANGE_NAME
        Name of the allocated IP range for the private IP AlloyDB cluster, for
        example: "google-managed-services-default". If set, the instance IPs
        for this cluster will be created in the allocated range. The range name
        must comply with RFC 1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
        characters long and match the regular expression
        [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?.
