DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an AlloyDB cluster within a given project and region.

EXAMPLES
    To update a cluster, run:

        $ gcloud alpha alloydb clusters update my-cluster \
            --region=us-central1 --automated-backup-start-times=12:00 \
            --automated-backup-days-of-week=MONDAY \

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CLUSTER
        AlloyDB cluster ID

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Regional location (e.g. asia-east1, us-east1). See the full list of
        regions at https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/instance-locations.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     Automated backup policy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-automated-backup
          Clears the automated backup policy on the cluster. The default
          automated backup policy will be used.

       --disable-automated-backup
          Disables automated backups on the cluster.

       Enable automated backup policy.

         --automated-backup-days-of-week=[DAYS_OF_WEEK,...]
            Comma-separated list of days of the week to perform a backup. At
            least one day of the week must be provided. (e.g.,

            DAYS_OF_WEEK must be one of: MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY,
            FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY.

         --automated-backup-start-times=[START_TIMES,...]

         --automated-backup-window=TIMEOUT_PERIOD
            The length of the time window beginning at start time during which
            a backup can be taken. If a backup does not succeed within this
            time window, it will be canceled and considered failed. The backup
            window must be at least 5 minutes long. There is no upper bound on
            the window. If not set, it will default to 1 hour.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alloydb clusters update

        $ gcloud beta alloydb clusters update
