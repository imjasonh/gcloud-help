DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an AlloyDB cluster within a given project and region.

EXAMPLES
    To update a cluster, run:

        $ gcloud alpha alloydb clusters update my-cluster \
            --region=us-central1 --automated-backup-start-times=12:00 \
            --automated-backup-days-of-week=MONDAY \
            --automated-backup-retention-count=10

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CLUSTER
        AlloyDB cluster ID

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Regional location (e.g. asia-east1, us-east1). See the full list of
        regions at https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/instance-locations.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --maintenance-version=MAINTENANCE_VERSION
        Maintenance version to update the cluster to. Use latest to apply the
        latest available maintenance version.

     --subscription-type=SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alloydb clusters update

        $ gcloud beta alloydb clusters update
