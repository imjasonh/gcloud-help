NAME
    gcloud alpha emulators spanner notices - print third-party notices for the
        local Cloud Spanner emulator

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha emulators spanner notices [--use-docker]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Print third-party notices for the local Cloud Spanner emulator.

EXAMPLES
    To print third-party notices for the local Cloud Spanner emulator, run:

        $ gcloud alpha emulators spanner notices

FLAGS
     --use-docker
        Use the Cloud Spanner emulator docker image even if the platform has a
        native binary available in the gcloud CLI. Currently we only provide a
        native binary for Linux. For other systems, you must install Docker for
        your platform before starting the emulator.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud emulators spanner notices

        $ gcloud beta emulators spanner notices
