NAME
    gcloud alpha emulators firestore start - start a local firestore emulator

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha emulators firestore start [--host-port=HOST_PORT]
        [--rules=RULES] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command starts a local firestore emulator.

EXAMPLES
    To start a local firestore emulator, run:

        $ gcloud alpha emulators firestore start

FLAGS
     --host-port=HOST_PORT
        The host:port to which the emulator should be bound. Can take the form
        of a single address (hostname, IPv4, or IPv6) and/or port:

            [ADDRESS][:PORT]

        In this format you must enclose IPv6 addresses in square brackets: e.g.

            [2001:db8:0:0:0:ff00:42:8329]:8080

        The default value is localhost:8080.

     --rules=RULES
        If set, all projects will use the security rules in this file

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta emulators firestore start
