NAME
    gcloud alpha emulators pubsub env-init - print the commands required to
        export pubsub emulator's env variables

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha emulators pubsub env-init [--data-dir=DATA_DIR]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) After starting the emulator, you need to set environment variables
    so that your application connects to the emulator instead of the production
    environment. Environment variables need to be set each time you start the
    emulator. The environment variables depend on dynamically assigned port
    numbers that could change when you restart the emulator.

EXAMPLES
    To print the env variables exports for a pubsub emulator, run:

        $ gcloud alpha emulators pubsub env-init --data-dir=DATA-DIR

    For a detailed walkthrough of setting Pub/Sub emulator environment
    variables, see https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator#env.

FLAGS
     --data-dir=DATA_DIR
        The directory to be used to store/retrieve data/config for an emulator
        run. The default value is <USER_CONFIG_DIR>/emulators/pubsub. The value
        of USER_CONFIG_DIR can be found by running:

            $ gcloud info --format='get(config.paths.global_config_dir)'

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta emulators pubsub env-init
