SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iot registries create (REGISTRY : --region=REGION)
        [--no-enable-http-config] [--no-enable-mqtt-config]
        [--event-notification-config=[subfolder=SUBFOLDER],[topic=TOPIC]]
        [--log-level=LOG_LEVEL] [--public-key-path=PUBLIC_KEY_PATH]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a new device registry.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new device registry 'my-registry' in region 'us-central1', run:

        $ gcloud alpha iot registries create --region=us-central1 my-registry

    The following command creates a new device registry 'my-registry' in region
    'us-central1', enables MQTT and HTTP connections, and sets
    'pubsub-topic-name' as the Cloud Pub/Sub topic for state notifications.

        $ gcloud alpha iot registries create my-registry \
            --region=us-central1 --enable-http-config --enable-mqtt-config \
            --state-pubsub-topic=pubsub-topic-name

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Registry resource - The registry you want to create. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument registry on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       REGISTRY
          ID of the registry or fully qualified identifier for the registry. To
          set the registry attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument registry on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Cloud IoT region. To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument registry on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line.

FLAGS
     --enable-http-config
        Whether to allow device connections to the HTTP bridge. Enabled by
        default, use --no-enable-http-config to disable.

     --enable-mqtt-config
        Whether to allow MQTT connections to this device registry. Enabled by
        default, use --no-enable-mqtt-config to disable.

     --event-notification-config=[subfolder=SUBFOLDER],[topic=TOPIC]
        The configuration for notification of telemetry events received from
        the device. This flag can be specified multiple times to add multiple
        configs to the device registry. Configs are added to the registry in
        the order the flags are specified. Only one config with an empty
        subfolder field is allowed and must be specified last.

         topic
            A Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic name for event notifications

         subfolder
            If the subfolder name matches this string exactly, this
            configuration will be used to publish telemetry events. If empty
            all strings are matched.

     --log-level=LOG_LEVEL
        The default logging verbosity for activity from devices in this
        registry. The verbosity level can be overridden by setting a specific
        device's log level. LOG_LEVEL must be one of:

         debug
            All events will be logged.
         error
            Error events will be logged.
         info
            Informational events will be logged, such as connections and
            disconnections. Also includes error events.
         none
            Disables logging.

     --public-key-path=PUBLIC_KEY_PATH
        Path to a file containing an X.509v3 certificate (RFC5280
        (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt)), encoded in base64, and wrapped
        by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE-----.

     --state-pubsub-topic=STATE_PUBSUB_TOPIC
        A Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic name for state notifications.
