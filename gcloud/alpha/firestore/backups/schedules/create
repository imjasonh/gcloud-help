          --day-of-week=MON

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --database=DATABASE
        The database to operate on.

        For example, to operate on database foo:

            $ gcloud alpha firestore backups schedules create --database='foo'

     --retention=RETENTION
        The rention of the backup. At what relative time in the future,
        compared to the creation time of the backup should the backup be
        deleted, i.e. keep backups for 7 days.

        For example, to set retention as 7 days.

            $ gcloud alpha firestore backups schedules create --retention=7d

     Recurrence settings of a backup schedule.

     This must be specified.

       --recurrence=RECURRENCE
          The recurrence settings of a backup schedule.

          Currently only daily and weekly backup schedules are supported.

          When a weekly backup schedule is created, day-of-week is needed.

          For example, to create a weekly backup schedule which creates backups
          on Monday.

              $ gcloud alpha firestore backups schedules create \
                  --recurrence=weekly --day-of-week=MON

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --day-of-week=DAY_OF_WEEK
          The day of week (UTC time zone) of when backups are created.

              The available values are: `MON`, `TUE`, `WED`, `THU`, `FRI`, `SAT`,`SUN`.
              Values are case insensitive.

              This is required when creating a weekly backup schedule.

          DAY_OF_WEEK must be one of: SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT.
