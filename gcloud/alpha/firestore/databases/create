EXAMPLES
    To create a Firestore Native database in nam5.

        $ gcloud alpha firestore databases create --location=nam5

    To create a Datastore Mode database in us-east1 with a databaseId foo.

        $ gcloud alpha firestore databases create --database=foo \
          --location=us-east1 --type=datastore-mode

    To create a Firestore Native database in nam5 with delete protection
    enabled.

        $ gcloud alpha firestore databases create --location=nam5 \
          --delete-protection

    To create a Firestore Native database in nam5 with Point In Time Recovery
    (PITR) enabled.

        $ gcloud alpha firestore databases create --location=nam5 \
          --enable-pitr

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        The location to operate on. Available locations are listed at
        https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/locations.

        For example, to operate on location us-east1:

            $ gcloud alpha firestore databases create --location='us-east1'

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --database=DATABASE; default="(default)"
        The ID to use for the database, which will become the final component
        of the database's resource name. If database ID is not provided,
        (default) will be used as database ID.

            This value should be 4-63 characters. Valid characters are /[a-z][0-9]-/
            with first character a letter and the last a letter or a number. Must
            not be UUID-like /[0-9a-f]{8}(-[0-9a-f]{4}){3}-[0-9a-f]{12}/.

            Using "(default)" database ID is also allowed.

     --delete-protection
        Whether to enable delete protection on the created database.

            If set to true, delete protection of the new database will be enabled
            and delete operations will fail unless delete protection is disabled.

            Default to false.

     --enable-pitr
        Whether to enable Point In Time Recovery (PITR) on the created
        database.

            If set to true, PITR on the new database will be enabled. By default,
            this feature is not enabled.

     --kms-key-name=KMS_KEY_NAME
        The resource ID of a Cloud KMS key. If set, the database created will
        be a Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) database encrypted with
        this key. This feature is allowlist only in initial launch.

            Only a key in the same location as this database is allowed to be used for encryption.
            For Firestore's nam5 multi-region, this corresponds to Cloud KMS location us.
            For Firestore's eur3 multi-region, this corresponds to Cloud KMS location europe.
            See https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/locations.

            This value should be the KMS key resource ID in the format of `projects/{project_id}/locations/{kms_location}/keyRings/{key_ring}/cryptoKeys/{crypto_key}`.
            How to retrieve this resource ID is listed at https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/getting-resource-ids#getting_the_id_for_a_key_and_version.

     --type=TYPE; default="firestore-native"
        The type of the database. TYPE must be one of: firestore-native,
        datastore-mode.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud firestore databases create

        $ gcloud beta firestore databases create
