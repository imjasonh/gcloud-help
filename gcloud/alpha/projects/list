NAME
    gcloud alpha projects list - list projects for which the user has
        resourcemanager.projects.list permission

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha projects list [--folder=FOLDER_ID]
        [--organization=ORGANIZATION_ID] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List all projects to which the user has access under the specified
    parent (either an Organization or a Folder). Exactly one of --folder or
    --organization can be provided.

    The output format slightly differs from the Beta and GA versions.

EXAMPLES
    The following command lists projects under the organization with ID
    123456789:

        $ gcloud alpha projects list --organization=123456789

    The following command lists projects with display names starting with a
    under folder with ID 123456789:

        $ gcloud alpha projects list --folder=123456789 \
            --filter='displayName:a*'

    The following command lists the last five created projects, sorted
    alphabetically by project ID:

        $ gcloud alpha projects list --sort-by=projectId --limit=5

    To list projects that have been marked for deletion:

        $ gcloud alpha projects list \
            --filter='lifecycleState:DELETE_REQUESTED'

FLAGS
     --folder=FOLDER_ID
        ID for the folder to list projects under

     --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
        ID for the organization to list projects under

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud projects list

        $ gcloud beta projects list
