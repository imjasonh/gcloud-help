NAME
    gcloud alpha projects describe - show metadata for a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha projects describe PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Shows metadata for a project given a valid project ID.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The project specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access the given
        project.

EXAMPLES
    The following command prints metadata for a project with the ID
    example-foo-bar-1:

        $ gcloud alpha projects describe example-foo-bar-1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER
        ID or number for the project you want to describe.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud projects describe

        $ gcloud beta projects describe
