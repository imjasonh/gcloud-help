NAME
    gcloud alpha projects delete - delete a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha projects delete PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER
        [--recommend=BOOLEAN_VALUE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deletes the project with the given project ID.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The project specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have IAM role role/owner or another IAM
        role with the resourcemanager.projects.delete permission for the given
        project.

    See Access control for projects using IAM
    (https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-proj) for
    more information.

EXAMPLES
    The following command deletes the project with the ID example-foo-bar-1:

        $ gcloud alpha projects delete example-foo-bar-1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER
        ID or number for the project you want to delete.

FLAGS
     --recommend=BOOLEAN_VALUE
        If true, checks Active Assist recommendation for the risk level of
        project deletion, and issues a warning in the prompt. Optional flag is
        set to false/no by default.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud projects delete

        $ gcloud beta projects delete
