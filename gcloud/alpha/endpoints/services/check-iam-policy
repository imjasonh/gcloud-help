NAME
    gcloud alpha endpoints services check-iam-policy - returns information
        about a principal's permissions on a service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha endpoints services check-iam-policy SERVICE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command lists the permissions that the current authenticated
    gcloud user has for a service. For example, if the authenticated user is
    able to delete the service, servicemanagement.services.delete will be among
    the returned permissions.

EXAMPLES
    To check the permissions for the currently authenticated gcloud, run:

        $ gcloud alpha endpoints services check-iam-policy \
            my_produced_service_name

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE
        The name of the service for which to check the IAM policy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud endpoints services check-iam-policy

        $ gcloud beta endpoints services check-iam-policy
