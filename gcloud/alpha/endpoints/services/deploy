NAME
    gcloud alpha endpoints services deploy - deploys a service configuration
        for the given service name

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha endpoints services deploy SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE
        [SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE ...] [--async] [--force, -f] [--validate-only]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command is used to deploy a service configuration for a
    service to Google Service Management. As input, it takes one or more paths
    to service configurations that should be uploaded. These configuration
    files can be Proto Descriptors, Open API (Swagger) specifications, or
    Google Service Configuration files in JSON or YAML formats.

    If a service name is present in multiple configuration files (given in the
    host field in OpenAPI specifications or the name field in Google Service
    Configuration files), the first one will take precedence.

    When deploying a new service configuration to an already-existing service,
    some safety checks will be made comparing the new configuration to the
    active configuration. If any actionable advice is provided, it will be
    printed out to the log, and the deployment will be halted. It is
    recommended that these warnings be addressed before proceeding, but they
    can be overridden with the --force flag.

    This command will block until deployment is complete unless the --async
    flag is passed.

EXAMPLES
    To deploy a single Open API service configuration, run:

        $ gcloud alpha endpoints services deploy ~/my_app/openapi.json

    To run the deployment asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud alpha endpoints services deploy ~/my_app/openapi.json \
            --async

    To deploy a service config with a Proto, run:

        $ gcloud alpha endpoints services deploy \
            ~/my_app/service-config.yaml ~/my_app/service-protos.pb

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE [SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE ...]
        The service configuration file (or files) containing the API
        specification to upload. Proto Descriptors, Open API (Swagger)
        specifications, and Google Service Configuration files in JSON and YAML
        formats are acceptable.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --force, -f
        Force the deployment even if any hazardous changes to the service
        configuration are detected.

     --validate-only
        If included, the command validates the service configuration(s), but
        does not deploy them. The service must exist in order to validate the
        configuration(s).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud endpoints services deploy

        $ gcloud beta endpoints services deploy
