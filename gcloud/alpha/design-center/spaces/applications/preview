SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications preview
        (APPLICATION : --location=LOCATION --space=SPACE) [--async]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Preview an application in a space.

EXAMPLES
    To preview the application my-application in space my-space, project
    my-project and location us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications preview \
            my-application --space=my-space --project=my-project \
            --location=us-central1

    Or run:

        $ gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications preview \
            projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/spaces/my-space/\
        applications/my-application

    To preview the application my-application in space my-space, project
    my-project and location us-central1 using a worker pool
    projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/workerPools/my-worker-pool, run:

        $ gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications preview \
            my-application --space=my-space --project=my-project \
            --location=us-central1 \
            --worker-pool=projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/\
        workerPools/my-worker-pool

    To preview the application my-application in space my-space, project
    my-project and location us-central1 asynchronously, run:

        $ gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications preview \
            my-application --space=my-space --project=my-project \
            --location=us-central1 --async

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Application resource - The application name in the following format:
     projects/$project/locations/$location/spaces/$space/applications/$application
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument application on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       APPLICATION
          ID of the application or fully qualified identifier for the
          application.

          To set the application attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument application on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the application resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument application on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

       --space=SPACE
          The space id of the application resource.

          To set the space attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument application on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --space on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        The email address of the service account to use for this preview
        operation.

        ◆ If provided, this service account will be used to execute the
          preview process, taking precedence over any service_account specified
          on the Application resource.
        ◆ The caller must have the 'iam.serviceAccounts.actAs' permission on
          this service account.
        ◆ If this field is omitted, the system will use the 'service_account'
          defined within the Application resource.
        ◆ We recommend that you provide a service account here or on the
          Application resource. If you don't provide a service account, the
          preview will fail. Format:
          projects/{PROJECT}/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}

     --worker-pool=WORKER_POOL
        The user-specified Worker Pool resource in which the Cloud Build job
        will execute. Format
        projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workerPools/{workerPoolId} If
        this field is unspecified, the default Cloud Build worker pool will be
        used. If omitted and application resource ref provided has worker_pool
        defined, that worker pool is used.
