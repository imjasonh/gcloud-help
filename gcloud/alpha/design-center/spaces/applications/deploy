NAME
    gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications deploy - deploy an
        application

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications deploy
        (APPLICATION : --location=LOCATION --space=SPACE) [--async] [--replace]
        [--service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT] [--worker-pool=WORKER_POOL]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deploy an application in a space.

EXAMPLES
    To deploy the application my-application in space my-space, project
    my-project and location us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications deploy \
            my-application --space=my-space --project=my-project \
            --location=us-central1

    Or run:

        $ gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications deploy \
            projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/spaces/my-space/\
        applications/my-application

    To deploy the application my-application in space my-space, project
    my-project and location us-central1 and replace the existing deployment,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications deploy \
            my-application --space=my-space --project=my-project \
            --location=us-central1 --replace

    To deploy the application my-application in space my-space, project
    my-project and location us-central1 using a worker pool
    projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/workerPools/my-worker-pool, run:

        $ gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications deploy \
            my-application --space=my-space --project=my-project \
            --location=us-central1 \
            --worker-pool=projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/\
        workerPools/my-worker-pool

    To deploy the application my-application in space my-space, project
    my-project and location us-central1 asynchronously, run:

        $ gcloud alpha design-center spaces applications deploy \
            my-application --space=my-space --project=my-project \
            --location=us-central1 --async

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Application resource - The application name. Format:
     projects/$project/locations/$location/spaces/$space/applications/$application
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument application on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       APPLICATION
          ID of the application or fully qualified identifier for the
          application.

          To set the application attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument application on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the application resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument application on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

       --space=SPACE
          The space id of the application resource.

          To set the space attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument application on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --space on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --replace
        Flag to update the existing deployment. If not set or false, deploy
        will fail if application state is in the DEPLOYED state.

     --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        The email address of the service account to use for this deployment.

        ◆ If provided, this service account will be used to execute the
          deployment process, taking precedence over any service_account
          specified on the Application resource.
        ◆ The caller must have the 'iam.serviceAccounts.actAs' permission on
          this service account.
        ◆ If this field is omitted, the system will use the 'service_account'
          defined within the Application resource.
        ◆ We recommend that you provide a service account here or on the
          Application resource. If you don't provide a service account, the
          deployment will fail. Format:
          projects/{PROJECT}/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}

     --worker-pool=WORKER_POOL
        The user-specified Worker Pool resource in which the Cloud Build job
        will execute. Format:
        projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workerPools/{workerPoolId} If
        this flag is omitted, the worker pool already defined on the
        application will be used. If no worker pool is defined on the
        application, the default Cloud Build worker pool is used. The worker
        pool must exist in the same region as the application.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the designcenter/v1alpha API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at:
    http://cloud.google.com/application-design-center/docs

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud design-center spaces applications deploy
