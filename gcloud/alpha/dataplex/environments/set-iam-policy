SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataplex environments set-iam-policy
        (ENVIRONMENT : --lake=LAKE --location=LOCATION) POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details
    of the policy file format and contents.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    policy.json and set it for the Dataplex environment test-environment within
    lake test-lake in location us-central1:

        $ gcloud alpha dataplex environments set-iam-policy \
            test-environment --project=test-project --location=us-central1 \
            --lake=test-lake policy.json

        where policy.json is the relative path to the json file.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Environments resource - The Environment to set IAM policy to. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument environment on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       ENVIRONMENT
          ID of the environments or fully qualified identifier for the
          environments. To set the environment attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument environment on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --lake=LAKE
          The identifier of the Dataplex lake resource. To set the lake
          attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument environment on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --lake on the command line.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Dataplex resource. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument environment on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property dataplex/location.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud dataplex environments set-iam-policy
