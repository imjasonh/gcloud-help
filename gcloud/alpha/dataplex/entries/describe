SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataplex entries describe
        (ENTRY : --entry-group=ENTRY_GROUP --location=LOCATION)

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Describe a Dataplex entry.

    Displays the details of a Dataplex entry resource given a valid entry ID.

EXAMPLES
    To describe a Dataplex entry entry1 within entry group entry-group1 in
    location us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha dataplex entries describe entry1 \
            --entry-group=entry-group1 --location=us-central1 \
            --project=test-project

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Entry resource - Arguments and flags that define the Dataplex Entry you
     want to describe. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument entry on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       ENTRY
          ID of the entry or fully qualified identifier for the entry.

          To set the entry attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument entry on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --entry-group=ENTRY_GROUP
          Entry group containing Dataplex Entries.

          To set the entry-group attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument entry on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --entry-group on the command line.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the Dataplex resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument entry on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property dataplex/location.

FLAGS
     --aspect-types=[ASPECT_TYPES,...]
        Limits the aspects returned to the provided aspect types. Only works if
        the --view=custom is selected.

        For example, if two aspect types are specified:
        "projects/projectA/locations/us-central1/my-aspect-type,projects/projectB/locations/us/my-aspect-type2"
        then only aspects matching these aspect types will be returned.

        Can be further constrained by the --paths argument.

     --paths=[PATHS,...]
        Limits the aspects returned to those associated with the provided paths
        within the Entry. Only works if the --view=custom is selected.

        For example, if two paths are specified: "--paths=property1,property2"
        then only aspects on these paths will be returned.

        To return aspects without any path, the empty (root) path can be
        specified. For this "." can be used. For example, when
        "--paths=.,property1" are specified, then only aspects on the path
        "property1" and on the entry itself will be returned.

        Can be further constrained by --aspect-types argument.

     --view=VIEW
        Controls which parts of an entry are to be returned. VIEW must be one
        of:

         all
            Returns all aspects. If the number of aspects would exceed 100, the
            first 100 will be returned.

         basic
            Returns entry only, without aspects.
         custom
            Returns aspects filtered based on --aspect-types AND --paths
            arguments specified. When used, at least one of --aspect-types and
            --paths arguments must be specified. If the number of aspects would
            exceed 100, the first 100 will be returned.

         full
            Default value. Returns all required aspects, as well as the keys of
            all non-required aspects.

    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:
