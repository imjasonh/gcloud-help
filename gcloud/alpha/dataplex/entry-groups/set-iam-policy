NAME
    gcloud alpha dataplex entry-groups set-iam-policy - set an IAM policy
        binding for a Dataplex Entry Group as defined in a JSON or YAML file

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataplex entry-groups set-iam-policy
        (ENTRY_GROUP : --location=LOCATION) POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details
    of the policy file format and contents.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    policy.json and set it for the Dataplex Entry Group test-entry-group in
    project test-project and in location us-central1:

        $ gcloud alpha dataplex entry-groups set-iam-policy \
            test-entry-group --project=test-project --location=us-central1 \
            policy.json

        where policy.json is the relative path to the JSON file.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Entry group resource - Arguments and flags that define the Dataplex entry
     group you want to set IAM policy to. The arguments in this group can be
     used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument entry_group on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       ENTRY_GROUP
          ID of the entry group or fully qualified identifier for the entry
          group.

          To set the entry-group attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument entry_group on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Dataplex resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument entry_group on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property dataplex/location.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud dataplex entry-groups set-iam-policy
