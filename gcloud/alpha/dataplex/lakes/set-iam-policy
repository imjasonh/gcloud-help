        POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details
    of the policy file format and contents.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    policy.son and set it for the Dataplex lake test-lake defined in location
    us-central1:

        $ gcloud alpha dataplex lakes set-iam-policy \
            --location=us-central1 test-lake policy.json

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Lakes resource - Arguments and flags that define the Dataplex lake you
     want to set IAM policy binding to. The arguments in this group can be used
     to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument lake on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       LAKE
          ID of the lakes or fully qualified identifier for the lakes. To set
          the lake attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument lake on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Dataplex resource. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument lake on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property dataplex/location.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud dataplex lakes set-iam-policy
