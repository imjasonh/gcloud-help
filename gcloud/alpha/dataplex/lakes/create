NAME
    gcloud alpha dataplex lakes create - create a Dataplex lake resource

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataplex lakes create (LAKE : --location=LOCATION) [--async]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--display-name=DISPLAY_NAME]
        [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [--metastore-service=METASTORE_SERVICE]
        [--validate-only] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) A lake is a centralized repository for managing data across the
    organization, where enterprise data is distributed across many cloud
    projects, and stored in a variety of storage services, such as Google Cloud
    Storage and BigQuery. A lake provides data admins with tools to organize,
    secure and manage their data at scale, and provides data scientists and
    data engineers an integrated experience to easily search, discover, analyze
    and transform data and associated metadata.

    The Lake ID will be used to generate names such as database and dataset
    names when publishing metadata to Hive Metastore and BigQuery. The Lake id
    must follow these rules:
      ▪ Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
      ▪ Must start with a letter.
      ▪ Must end with a number or a letter.
      ▪ Must be between 1-63 characters.
      ▪ Must be unique within the customer project / location.

EXAMPLES
    To create a Dataplex lake with name my-dataplex-lake in location
    us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha dataplex lakes create my-dataplex-lake \
            --location=us-central

    To create a Dataplex lake with name my-dataplex-lake in location
    us-central1 with metastore service service-123abc attached, run:

        $ gcloud alpha dataplex lakes create my-dataplex-lake \
            --location=us-central \
            --metastore-service=projects/my-project/services/service-123abc

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Lakes resource - Arguments and flags that define the Dataplex lake you
     want to create. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument lake on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       LAKE
          ID of the lakes or fully qualified identifier for the lakes.

          To set the lake attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument lake on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Dataplex resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument lake on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property dataplex/location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the lake.

     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
        Display name of the lake.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     Settings to manage metadata publishing to a Hive Metastore from a lake.

       --metastore-service=METASTORE_SERVICE
          A relative reference to the Dataproc Metastore
          (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-metastore/docs) service instance
          into which metadata will be published. This is of the form:
          projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/services/{service_id}
          where the location matches the location of the lake.

     --validate-only
        Validate the create action, but don't actually perform it.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud dataplex lakes create
