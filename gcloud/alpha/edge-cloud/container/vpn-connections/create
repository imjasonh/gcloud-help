NAME
    gcloud alpha edge-cloud container vpn-connections create - create a VPN
        connection between an Edge Container cluster and a VPC network

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha edge-cloud container vpn-connections create
        (VPN_CONNECTION : --location=LOCATION) --cluster=CLUSTER
        --vpc-network=VPC_NETWORK [--async] [--high-availability]
        [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [--nat-gateway-ip=NAT_GATEWAY_IP]
        [--router=ROUTER] [--vpc-project=VPC_PROJECT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates a new VPN connection.

EXAMPLES
    To create a connection called 'my-vpn-connection' between the VPC network
    'my-vpc' and the Edge Container cluster 'my-cluster' which is at region
    us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha edge-cloud container vpn-connections create \
            my-vpn-connection --location=us-central1 \
            --vpc-network='my-vpc' --cluster='my-cluster'

    Here VPC network and cluster should be under the same project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Vpn connection resource - VPN connection to create. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument vpn_connection on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       VPN_CONNECTION
          ID of the vpn connection or fully qualified identifier for the vpn
          connection. To set the vpn_connection attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument vpn_connection on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The global location name. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument vpn_connection on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property edge_container/location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --cluster=CLUSTER
        The name of the cluster to be connected under current project.

     --vpc-network=VPC_NETWORK
        The name of the VPC network to be connected. By default it is assumed
        to be under the same project as cluster. If this VPC network is under a
        different project, vpc-project is required.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --high-availability
        Enables high availability on cluster side. This creates an additional
        VPN endpoint in cluster. Multiple Nodes/NodePools are required to
        enable this feature.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --nat-gateway-ip=NAT_GATEWAY_IP
        The NAT gateway IP for the gateway floating IPs. Required if cluster
        sits behind NAT.

     --router=ROUTER
        Name of the Cloud Router to use when creating the VPN connection. This
        Cloud Router must be in the same region as the cluster and connected to
        the provided VPC network. If not provided, a service-managed Cloud
        Router will either be created or reused to create the VPN connection.

     --vpc-project=VPC_PROJECT
        The project of the VPC network. Required if the project of VPC network
        differs from the project of the cluster.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the edgecontainer/v1alpha API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/edge-cloud

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud edge-cloud container vpn-connections create
