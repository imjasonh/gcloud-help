DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a VMware Engine VPC network peering. VPC network peering
    creation is considered finished when the network peering is in ACTIVE
    state. Check the progress of a VPC network peering using gcloud alpha
    vmware network-peerings list.

EXAMPLES
    To create a VPC network peering called new-peering that connects the VMware
    Engine network
    projects/my-project/locations/us-west1/vmwareEngineNetworks/my-vmware-engine-network
    with another VMware Engine network
    projects/another-project/global/networks/another-vmware-engine-network,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha vmware network-peerings create new-peering \
            --vmware-engine-network=projects/my-project/locations/us-west1/\
        vmwareEngineNetworks/my-vmware-engine-network \
            --peer-network=projects/another-project/global/networks/\
        another-vmware-engine-network \
            --peer-network-type=VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK

    In this example, the project is taken from gcloud properties core/project
    and location is taken as global.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     VMware Engine VPC network peering resource - network_peering. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument network_peering on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       NETWORK_PEERING
          ID of the VMware Engine VPC network peering or fully qualified
          identifier for the VMware Engine VPC network peering. To set the
          network-peering attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument network_peering on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --peer-network=PEER_NETWORK
        Name of the VPC network to peer with the VMware Engine network. The
        peer network can be a consumer VPC network or another service producer
        VPC network. For a consumer VPC network, provide the name in the
        following form: projects/{project}/global/networks/{network_id} If the
        peer network is of type VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK, then the peer network
        will be a service producer VPC network. For a service producer VPC
        network, provide the name in the following form:
        projects/{project}/locations/{location}/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmware_engine_network_id}

     --peer-network-type=PEER_NETWORK_TYPE
        Type of the VPC network to peer with the VMware Engine network.
        PEER_NETWORK_TYPE must be one of the following:
        ◆ STANDARD: Peering connection used for connecting to another VPC
          network established by the same user. For example, a peering
          connection to another VPC network in the same project or to an
          on-premises network.
        ◆ VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK: Peering connection used for connecting to
          another VMware Engine network.
        ◆ PRIVATE_SERVICES_ACCESS: Peering connection used for establishing
          private services access.
        ◆ NETAPP_CLOUD_VOLUMES: Peering connection used for connecting to
          NetApp Cloud Volumes.
        ◆ THIRD_PARTY_SERVICE: Peering connection used for connecting to
          third-party services. Most third-party services require manual setup
          of reverse peering on the VPC network associated with the third-party
          service. PEER_NETWORK_TYPE must be one of:
          PEER_NETWORK_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, STANDARD, VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK,
          PRIVATE_SERVICES_ACCESS, NETAPP_CLOUD_VOLUMES, THIRD_PARTY_SERVICE.

     VMware Engine network resource - vmware_engine_network. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --vmware-engine-network on the command line with
        a fully specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       --vmware-engine-network=VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK
          ID of the VMware Engine network or fully qualified identifier for the
          VMware Engine network. To set the vmware-engine-network attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --vmware-engine-network on the command line.

          This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The resource name of the location. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --vmware-engine-network on the command line
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set location as 'global' (default) or a region.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        User-provided description of the VPC network peering.

     --exchange-subnet-routes
        True if full-mesh connectivity is created and managed automatically
        between peered VPC networks; false otherwise. This field is always true
        because Google Compute Engine automatically creates and manages
        subnetwork routes between two VPC networks when the peering state is
        ACTIVE. Enabled by default, use --no-exchange-subnet-routes to disable.

     --export-custom-routes
        True if custom routes are exported to the peered VPC network; false
        otherwise. The default value is true. Enabled by default, use
        --no-export-custom-routes to disable.

     --export-custom-routes-with-public-ip
        True if all subnet routes with public IP address range are exported;
        false otherwise. The default value is true. Enabled by default, use
        --no-export-custom-routes-with-public-ip to disable.

     --import-custom-routes
        True if custom routes are imported to the peered VPC network; false
        otherwise. The default value is true. Enabled by default, use
        --no-import-custom-routes to disable.

     --import-custom-routes-with-public-ip
        True if all subnet routes with public IP address range are imported;
        false otherwise. The default value is true. Enabled by default, use
        --no-import-custom-routes-with-public-ip to disable.

     --peer-mtu=PEER_MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) in bytes.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
