NAME
    gcloud alpha notebooks instances set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for an
        Instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha notebooks instances set-iam-policy
        (INSTANCE : --location=LOCATION) POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) This command is deprecated. Please use gcloud
    notebooks instead.

    gcloud alpha notebooks instances set-iam-policy sets the IAM policy for a
    Notebook instance given an instance ID and a JSON or YAML file that
    describes the IAM policy.

    Note: Setting the IAM policy for an Instance replaces existing IAM bindings
    for that account.

EXAMPLES
    The following command reads an IAM policy defined in the JSON file
    policy.json and sets it for Instance ID my_instance at the specified
    locaiton:

        $ gcloud alpha notebooks instances set-iam-policy my_instance \
            --location=us-central1-a policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for policy file
    format and content details.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - The ID of the instance for which to display the IAM
     policy. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance.

          To set the instance attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the notebook instance.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property notebooks/location.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
