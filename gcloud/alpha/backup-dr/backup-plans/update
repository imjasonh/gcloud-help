SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha backup-dr backup-plans update
        (BACKUP_PLAN : --location=LOCATION)
        [--add-backup-rule=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]] [--async]
        [--backup-rule=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a specific backup plan in the project. It can only be
    updated in regions supported by the Backup and DR Service.

EXAMPLES
    To update 2 backup rules and description of an existing backup plan
    sample-backup-plan in project sample-project, at location us-central1:

    run:

        $ gcloud alpha backup-dr backup-plans update sample-backup-plan \
            --project=sample-project --location=us-central1 \
            --backup-rule <BACKUP-RULE> --backup-rule <BACKUP-RULE> \
            --description "This is a sample backup plan"

    To add backup rules to an existing backup plan sample-backup-plan in
    project sample-project, at location us-central1:

    run:

        $ gcloud alpha backup-dr backup-plans update sample-backup-plan \
            --project=sample-project --location=us-central1 \
            --add-backup-rule <BACKUP-RULE> --add-backup-rule <BACKUP-RULE>

    To remove a backup rule with id sample-daily-rule from an existing backup
    plan sample-backup-plan in project sample-project, at location us-central1:

    run:

        $ gcloud alpha backup-dr backup-plans update sample-backup-plan \
            --project=sample-project --location=us-central1 \
            --remove-backup-rule sample-daily-rule

    To override backup rules in an existing backup plan sample-backup-plan in
    project sample-project, at location us-central1, pass a file path
    containing backup rules in YAML or JSON format: This flag is mutually
    exclusive with --add-backup-rule, --remove-backup-rule and --backup-rule
    flags.

    run:        $ gcloud alpha backup-dr backup-plans update sample-backup-plan \
            --project=sample-project --location=us-central1 \
            --backup-rules-fom-file <FILE_PATH>

      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP_PLAN
          ID of the Backup Plan or fully qualified identifier for the Backup
          Plan.

          To set the name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup_plan on the command line.

          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Backup Plan.

          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --add-backup-rule=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Parameters of backup rule to be added to the Backup Plan. This flag can
        be repeated to add more backup rules.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --backup-rule=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Full definition of an existing backup rule with updated values. The
        existing backup rule is replaced by this new set of values. This flag
        can be repeated to update multiple backup rules. It is not allowed to
        pass the same rule-id in this flag more than once in the same command.

        Parameters for the backup rule include:

         rule-id
            Name of the backup rule. The name must be unique and start with a
            lowercase letter followed by up to 62 lowercase letters, numbers,
            or hyphens.

         retention-days
            Duration for which backup data should be retained. It must be
            defined in "days". The value should be greater than or equal to the
            enforced retention period set for the backup vault.

         recurrence
            Frequency for the backup schedule. It must be either: HOURLY,
            DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY or YEARLY.

         backup-window-start
            Start time of the interval during which backup jobs should be
            executed. It can be defined as backup-window-start=2, that means
            backup window starts at 2 a.m. The start time and end time must
            have an interval of 6 hours.

         backup-window-end
            End time of the interval during which backup jobs should be
            executed. It can be defined as backup-window-end=14, that means
            backup window ends at 2 p.m. The start time and end time must have
            an interval of 6 hours.

            Jobs are queued at the beginning of the window and will be marked
            as SKIPPED if they do not start by the end time. Jobs that are in
            progress will not be canceled at the end time.

         time-zone
            The time zone to be used for the backup schedule. The value must
            exist in the IANA tz database (https://www.iana.org/time-zones).

         Following flags are mutually exclusive:

         hourly-frequency
            Frequency for hourly backups. An hourly frequency of 2 means backup
            jobs will run every 2 hours from start time till the end time
            defined. The hourly frequency must be between 4 and 23. The value
            is needed only if recurrence type is HOURLY.

         days-of-week
            Days of the week when the backup job should be executed. The value
            is needed if recurrence type is WEEKLY. E.g., MONDAY,TUESDAY

         MONDAY'"

     --backup-rules-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
        Path to a YAML or JSON file containing backup rules. Use a full or
        relative path to a local file containing the value of backup_rules.

        and relevant details, in 2048 characters or less.
