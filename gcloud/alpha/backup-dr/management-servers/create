NAME
    gcloud alpha backup-dr management-servers create - create a new management
        server in the project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha backup-dr management-servers create
        (MANAGEMENT_SERVER : --location=LOCATION) [--async] [--network=NETWORK]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a new management server in the project. A management server
    is required to access the management console. It can only be created in
    locations where Backup and DR is available. Resources in other locations
    can be backed up.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new management server sample-ms in project sample-project and
    location us-central1 with network sample-network, run:

        $ gcloud alpha backup-dr management-servers create sample-ms \
            --project=sample-project --location=us-central1 \
            --network=projects/sample-project/global/networks/sample-network

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Management Server resource - Name of the management server to be created.
     Once the management server is deployed, this name can't be changed. The
     name must be unique for a project and location. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument management_server on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       MANAGEMENT_SERVER
          ID of the Management Server or fully qualified identifier for the
          Management Server.

          To set the name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument management_server on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Management Server.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument management_server on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --network=NETWORK
        Name of an existing VPC network with private service access configured
        in the format - projects/<project>/global/networks/<network>. This VPC
        network allows the management console to communicate with all
        backup/recovery appliances and requires a minimum IP range of /23. This
        value cannot be changed after you deploy the management server. If you
        don't have private service access, configure one. [Learn more]
        (https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-services-access)

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud backup-dr management-servers create

        $ gcloud beta backup-dr management-servers create
