POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup Vault resource - Name of the existing backup vault to update. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument backup_vault on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP_VAULT
          ID of the Backup Vault or fully qualified identifier for the Backup
          Vault.

          To set the name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup_vault on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Backup Vault.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup_vault on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --no-async
        Wait for the operation in progress to complete.

     --backup-min-enforced-retention=BACKUP_MIN_ENFORCED_RETENTION
        Backups will be kept for this minimum period before they can be
        deleted. Once the effective time is reached, the enforced retention
        period cannot be decreased or removed.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Optional description for the backup vault (2048 characters or less).

     --effective-time=EFFECTIVE_TIME
        The time at which the enforced retention period becomes locked. This
        flag is mutually exclusive with --unlock-backup-min-enforced-retention.

     --force-update
        If set, allow update to extend the minimum enforced retention for
        backup vault. This overrides the restriction against conflicting
        retention periods. This conflict may occur when the expiration schedule
        defined by the associated backup plan is shorter than the minimum
        retention set by the backup vault.

     --unlock-backup-min-enforced-retention
        Removes the lock on the backup minimum enforced retention period, and
        resets the effective time. When unlocked, the enforced retention period
        can be changed at any time. This flag is mutually exclusive with
        --effective-time.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
