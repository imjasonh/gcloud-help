        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

FLAGS
     --access-restriction=ACCESS_RESTRICTION
        Authorize certain sources and destinations for data being sent into, or
        restored from the current backup vault.

        Access restrictions can be modified to be more or less restrictive.

            ::: More restrictive access restriction update will fail by default if there will be non compliant Data Sources.
            To allow such updates, use the --force-update-access-restriction flag.
            :::  For Google Cloud Console resources, the following changes are allowed to make access restrictions more restrictive:
                *   `UNRESTRICTED` to `WITHIN_PROJECT` / `WITHIN_ORG_BUT_UNRESTRICTED_FOR_BA` / `WITHIN_ORGANIZATION`
                *   `WITHIN_PROJECT` to `WITHIN_ORGANIZATION` / `WITHIN_ORG_BUT_UNRESTRICTED_FOR_BA`

            ::: For Management Server resources, the following changes are allowed to make access restrictions more restrictive:
                *   `UNRESTRICTED` to `WITHIN_PROJECT` / `WITHIN_ORG_BUT_UNRESTRICTED_FOR_BA` / `WITHIN_ORGANIZATION`
                *   `WITHIN_PROJECT` to `WITHIN_ORGANIZATION` / `WITHIN_ORG_BUT_UNRESTRICTED_FOR_BA`

            :::   For both Google Cloud Console and Management Server resources, the following changes are allowed to make access restrictions more restrictive:
                *   `UNRESTRICTED` to `WITHIN_PROJECT` / `WITHIN_ORG_BUT_UNRESTRICTED_FOR_BA` / `WITHIN_ORGANIZATION`
                *   `WITHIN_PROJECT` to `WITHIN_ORGANIZATION` / `WITHIN_ORG_BUT_UNRESTRICTED_FOR_BA`

            ::: For Google Cloud Console resources,  the following changes are allowed to make access restrictions less restrictive:
                *   `WITHIN_ORGANIZATION` to `UNRESTRICTED` / `WITHIN_ORG_BUT_UNRESTRICTED_FOR_BA`
                *   `WITHIN_PROJECT` to `UNRESTRICTED`
                *   `WITHIN_ORG_BUT_UNRESTRICTED_FOR_BA` to `UNRESTRICTED`

            ::: For Management Server resources, the following changes are allowed to make access restrictions less restrictive:
                *   `WITHIN_ORG_BUT_UNRESTRICTED_FOR_BA` to `UNRESTRICTED`

        ACCESS_RESTRICTION must be one of: within-project, within-org,
        unrestricted, within-org-but-unrestricted-for-ba.

     --no-async
        Wait for the operation in progress to complete.

     --backup-min-enforced-retention=BACKUP_MIN_ENFORCED_RETENTION
        Backups will be kept for this minimum period before they can be
        deleted. Once the effective time is reached, the enforced retention
        period cannot be decreased or removed. The value must be specified in
        relative time format (e.g. p1d, p1m, p1m1d).

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Optional description for the backup vault (2048 characters or less).

     --effective-time=EFFECTIVE_TIME
        The time at which the enforced retention period becomes locked. This
        flag is mutually exclusive with --unlock-backup-min-enforced-retention.

     --force-update
        If set, allow update to extend the minimum enforced retention for
        backup vault. This overrides the restriction against conflicting
        retention periods. This conflict may occur when the expiration schedule
        defined by the associated backup plan is shorter than the minimum
        retention set by the backup vault.

     --force-update-access-restriction
        If set, the access restriction can be updated even if there are
        non-compliant data sources. Backups for those data sources will fail
        afterward.

     --unlock-backup-min-enforced-retention
        Removes the lock on the backup minimum enforced retention period, and
        resets the effective time. When unlocked, the enforced retention period
        can be changed at any time. This flag is mutually exclusive with
        --effective-time.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:
