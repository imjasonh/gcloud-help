DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Restores a Compute Disk Backup.

EXAMPLES
    To restore a backup sample-backup in project sample-project and location
    us-central1, with sample-data-store and sample-backup-vault, and additional
    target properties, run:

        $ gcloud alpha backup-dr backups restore disk sample-backup \
            --project=sample-project --location=us-central1 \
            --backup-vault=sample-backup-vault \
            --data-source=sample-data-source --<target-properties>

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup resource - The backup of a resource to be restored. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.
     (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
     set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument backup on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP
          ID of the Backup or fully qualified identifier for the Backup.

          To set the name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --backup-vault=BACKUP_VAULT
          The ID of the Backup Vault.

          To set the backup-vault attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --backup-vault on the command line.

       --data-source=DATA_SOURCE
          The ID of the Data Source.

          To set the data-source attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --data-source on the command line.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Backup.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --name=NAME
        Name of the restored Disk.

     --target-project=TARGET_PROJECT
        Project where the restore should happen.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --access-mode=ACCESS_MODE
        Specifies how VMs attached to the disk can access the data on the disk.
        To grant read-only access to multiple VMs attached to the disk, set
        access-mode to READ_ONLY_MANY. To grant read-write access to only one
        VM attached to the disk, use READ_WRITE_SINGLE. READ_WRITE_SINGLE is
        used if omitted. ACCESS_MODE must be one of: READ_ONLY_MANY,
        READ_WRITE_MANY, READ_WRITE_SINGLE. ACCESS_MODE must be one of:

         READ_ONLY_MANY
            The AccessMode means the disk can be attached to multiple instances
            in RW mode.
         READ_WRITE_MANY
            The AccessMode means the disk can be attached to multiple instances
            in RO mode.
         READ_WRITE_SINGLE
            The default AccessMode, means the disk can be attached to single
            instance in RW mode.

     --architecture=ARCHITECTURE
        Specifies the architecture or processor type that this disk can
        support. For available processor types on Compute Engine, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms. ARCHITECTURE must
        be one of: ARM64, X86_64. ARCHITECTURE must be one of:

         ARM64
            The disk can only be used with ARM64 machines.
         X86_64
            The disk can only be used with x86_64 machines.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --confidential-compute
        Creates the disk with confidential compute mode enabled. Encryption
        with a Cloud KMS key is required to enable this option.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description of the restored disk.

     --guest-os-features=[GUEST_OS_FEATURES,...]
        Enables one or more features for VM instances that use the image for
        their boot disks. See the descriptions of supported features at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/create-delete-deprecate-private-images#guest-os-features.
        GUEST_OS_FEATURE must be one of: VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE, WINDOWS,
        MULTI_IP_SUBNET, UEFI_COMPATIBLE, SEV_CAPABLE, SEV_LIVE_MIGRATABLE,

        projects/<project>/locations/<location>/keyRings/<key-ring>/cryptoKeys/<key>

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (), lowercase characters, and

        should be replicated to. Required when restoring to a regional disk.
        The zones must be in the same region as specified in the

        list.

     --resource-policies=RESOURCE_POLICY,[...]

        size is not specified, the default size of 500GB for pd-standard disks,
        100GB for pd-balanced disks, 100GB for pd-ssd disks, and 1000GB for
        pd-extreme disks will be used. For details about disk size limits,
        refer to: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks

     --storage-pool=STORAGE_POOL
        Specifies the URI of the storage pool in which the disk is created.

     --target-region=TARGET_REGION
        Region where the target disk is restored. This flag is mutually
        exclusive with --target-zone.

     --target-zone=TARGET_ZONE
        Zone where the target disk is restored. This flag is mutually exclusive
        with --target-region.

     --type=TYPE
        URL of the disk type describing which disk type to use to restore the
        disk. For example: projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-ssd. To get
        a list of available disk types, run gcloud compute disk-types list. The
        default disk type is pd-standard.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,

BRIEF
    Restores the specified backup

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
