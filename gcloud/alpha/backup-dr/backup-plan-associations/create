NAME
    gcloud alpha backup-dr backup-plan-associations create - create a new
        backup plan association

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha backup-dr backup-plan-associations create
        (BACKUP_PLAN_ASSOCIATION
          : --location=LOCATION --workload-project=WORKLOAD_PROJECT)
        --backup-plan=BACKUP_PLAN --resource=RESOURCE [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a new backup plan association in the project. It can only be
    created in locations where Backup and DR is available.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new backup plan association sample-bpa in project
    sample-project and location us-central1 for resource sample-resource-uri
    with backup plan sample-backup-plan, run:

        $ gcloud alpha backup-dr backup-plan-associations create \
            sample-bpa --project=sample-project --location=us-central1 \
            --backup-plan=sample-backup-plan --resource=sample-resource-uri

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup Plan Association resource - Name of the backup plan association to
     be created. Once the backup plan association is created, this name can't
     be changed. The name must be unique for a project and location. To create
     backup plan associations in a project that's different from the backup
     plan, use the --workload-project flag. The arguments in this group can be
     used to specify the attributes of this resource.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP_PLAN_ASSOCIATION
          ID of the Backup Plan Association or fully qualified identifier for
          the Backup Plan Association.

          To set the name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument BACKUP_PLAN_ASSOCIATION on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the Backup Plan Association.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument BACKUP_PLAN_ASSOCIATION on the command line
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

       --workload-project=WORKLOAD_PROJECT
          Cloud project id for the Backup Plan Association.

          To set the workload-project attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument BACKUP_PLAN_ASSOCIATION on the command line
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --workload-project on the command line;
          ▸ provide the argument --project on the command line;
          ▸ set the property core/project.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Backup Plan resource - The backup plan to be applied to the resource.
     E.g.,

     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --backup-plan on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     To set the location attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --backup-plan on the command line with a fully
        specified name;

          ▸ provide the argument --backup-plan on the command line.

     --resource=RESOURCE
        The resource to which the backup plan is to be applied. E.g.,
        projects/sample-project/zones/us-central1-a/instances/sample-instance

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
