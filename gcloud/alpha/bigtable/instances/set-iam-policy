NAME
    gcloud alpha bigtable instances set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for an
        instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha bigtable instances set-iam-policy INSTANCE POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Set the IAM policy for a Cloud Bigtable instance.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy from 'policy.json' and set it
    for an instance with 'my-instance-id' as the identifier:

        $ gcloud alpha bigtable instances set-iam-policy my-instance-id \
            policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - The instance to set the IAM policy for. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance. To
          set the instance attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud bigtable instances set-iam-policy

        $ gcloud beta bigtable instances set-iam-policy
