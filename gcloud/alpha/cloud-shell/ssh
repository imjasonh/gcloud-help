NAME
    gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh - allows you to establish an interactive SSH
        session with Cloud Shell

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh [--authorize-session] [--command=COMMAND]
        [--dry-run] [--force-key-file-overwrite] [--ssh-flag=SSH_FLAG]
        [--ssh-key-file] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...] [-- SSH_ARGS ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh lets you remotely log in to Cloud
    Shell. If your Cloud Shell is not currently running, this will cause it to
    be started before establishing the SSH session.

EXAMPLES
    To SSH into your Cloud Shell, run:

        $ gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh

    To run a remote command in your Cloud Shell, run:

        $ gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh --command=ls

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [-- SSH_ARGS ...]
        Flags and positionals passed to the underlying ssh implementation.

        The '--' argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
        left and SSH_ARGS on the right. Example:

            $ gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh -- -vvv

FLAGS
     --authorize-session
        If provided, sends OAuth credentials to the current Cloud Shell session
        on behalf of the user. When this completes, the session will be
        authorized to run various Google Cloud command-line tools without
        requiring the user to manually authenticate.

     --command=COMMAND
        A command to run in Cloud Shell.

        Runs the command in Cloud Shell and then exits.

     --dry-run
        If provided, prints the command that would be run to standard out
        instead of executing it.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled gcloud will regenerate and overwrite the files associated
        with a broken SSH key without asking for confirmation in both
        interactive and non-interactive environment.

        If disabled gcloud will not attempt to regenerate the files associated
        with a broken SSH key and fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environment.

     --ssh-flag=SSH_FLAG
        Additional flags to be passed to ssh(1).

     --ssh-key-file
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud cloud-shell ssh

        $ gcloud beta cloud-shell ssh
