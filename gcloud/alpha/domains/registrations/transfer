DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a new Cloud Domains registration resource by transferring an
    existing domain from another registrar. The new resource's ID will be equal
    to the domain name.

    After this command executes, the resource will be in state
    TRANSFER_PENDING. To complete the transfer, the registrant may need to
    approve the transfer through an email sent by the current registrar. Domain
    transfers can take 5-7 days to complete. After the transfer is completed,
    the resource transitions to state ACTIVE, indicating that the transfer was
    successful. If the transfer is rejected or the request expires without
    being approved, the resource ends up in state TRANSFER_FAILED. If the
    transfer fails, you can safely delete the resource and retry the transfer.
    Transfers in state TRANSFER_PENDING can also be cancelled with the delete
    command.

EXAMPLES
    To transfer example.com interactively, run:

        $ gcloud alpha domains registrations transfer example.com

    To transfer example.com using contact data from a YAML file contacts.yaml,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha domains registrations transfer example.com \
            --contact-data-from-file=contacts.yaml

    To transfer example.com with interactive prompts disabled, provide
    --authorization-code-from-file, --contact-data-from-file,
    --contact-privacy, --yearly-price flags and one of the flags for setting
    authoritative name servers. Sometimes also --notices flag is required.

COMMONLY USED FLAGS
     --authorization-code-from-file=AUTHORIZATION_CODE_FILE_NAME
        A file containing the authorizaton code. In most cases, you must
        provide an authorization code from the domain's current registrar to
        transfer the domain.

        Examples of file contents:

            5YcCd!X&W@q0Xozj

     --contact-data-from-file=CONTACT_DATA_FILE_NAME
        A YAML file containing the contact data for the domain's three
        contacts: registrant, admin, and technical.

        The file can either specify a single set of contact data with label
        'allContacts', or three separate sets of contact data with labels
        'adminContact' and 'technicalContact'.

        Each contact data must contain values for all required fields: email,
        phoneNumber and postalAddress in google.type.PostalAddress format.

     --contact-privacy=CONTACT_PRIVACY
        The contact privacy mode to use. Supported privacy modes depend on the
        domain. CONTACT_PRIVACY must be one of:

         private-contact-data
            Your contact info won't be available to the public. To help protect
            your info and prevent spam, a third party provides alternate
            (proxy) contact info for your domain in the public directory at no
            extra cost. They will forward received messages to you.
         public-contact-data
            All the data from contact config is publicly available. To set this
            value, you must also pass the --notices flag with value
            public-contact-data-acknowledgement or agree to the notice
            interactively.
         redacted-contact-data
            Limited personal information will be available to the public. The
            actual information redacted depends on the domain. For more
            information see https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3251242.

     --validate-only
        Don't actually transfer domain. Only validate arguments.

     Set the authoritative name servers for the given domain.

         Warning: If your DNS is hosted by your old registrar, we do not
         recommend keeping your current DNS settings, as these services
         often terminate when you transfer out. Instead, you should
         switch to another DNS provider such as Cloud DNS. To avoid
         downtime during the transfer, copy your DNS records to your new
         DNS provider before initiating transfer.

         Warning: If you are changing your DNS settings and your domain
         currently has DS records, make sure to remove the DS records at
         your old registrar and wait a day before initiating transfer.
         If you are keeping your current DNS settings, then no changes
         to DS records are necessary.

    At most one of these can be specified:

         --cloud-dns-zone=CLOUD_DNS_ZONE
            The name of the Cloud DNS managed-zone to set as the name server
            for the domain. If it's in the same project, you can use short
            name. If not, use the full resource name, e.g.:
            --cloud-dns-zone=projects/example-project/managedZones/example-zone.
            To avoid downtime following transfer, make sure the zone is
            configured correctly before proceeding. DNSSEC will be disabled and
            will need to be enabled after the transfer completes, if desired.

         --keep-dns-settings
            Keep the domain's current DNS configuration from its current
            registrar. Use this option only if you are sure that the domain's
            current DNS service will not cease upon transfer, as is often the
            case for DNS services provided for free by the registrar.

         --use-google-domains-dns
            Use free name servers provided by Google Domains. This blank-slate
            option cannot be configured before transfer. DNSSEC will be
            disabled and will need to be enabled after the transfer completes,
            if desired.

OTHER FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --notices=[NOTICE,...]
        Notices about special properties of certain domains or contacts. NOTICE
        must be (only one value is supported):

         public-contact-data-acknowledgement
            By sending this notice you acknowledge that using
            public-contact-data contact privacy makes all the data from contact
            config publicly available.

     --yearly-price=YEARLY_PRICE
        You must accept the yearly price of the domain, either in the
        interactive flow or using this flag. The expected format is a number
        followed by a currency code, e.g. "12.00 USD". You can get the price
        using the get-transfer-parameters command.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud domains registrations transfer

        $ gcloud beta domains registrations transfer
