NAME
    gcloud alpha active-directory domains migration check-permissions - check
        existing permissions on a Managed Microsoft AD domain for domain
        migration

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha active-directory domains migration check-permissions DOMAIN
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Check existing permissions on a Managed Microsoft AD domain for
    domain migration.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The specified domain doesn't exist.
      ▪ The specified domain is either being created or updated.
      ▪ The active account doesn't have permission to check migration
        permissions on the specified domain.

EXAMPLES
    The following command checks migration permissions on the domain
    my-domain.com in project my-project.

    $ gcloud alpha active-directory domains migration \        check-permissions my-domain.com --project=my-project

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

     want to check migration permissions. This represents a Cloud resource.
     (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
     set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument domain on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       DOMAIN
          ID of the domain or fully qualified identifier for the domain. To set
          the domain attribute:
