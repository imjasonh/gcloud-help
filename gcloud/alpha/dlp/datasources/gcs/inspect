DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Schedules a job to inspect content in a Google Cloud Storage bucket
    for sensitive data.

    See Inspecting Storage and Databases for Sensitive Data
    (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/inspecting-storage) for more details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a job my-gcs-job to scan files in the Google
    Cloud Storage path gs://testproject/dlp/*:

        $ gcloud alpha dlp datasources gcs inspect \
            `gs://testproject/dlp/*` --job-id my-gcs-job \
            --file-size-limit 10000 --min-time '2018-01-01T12:00:00Z' \
            --max-time '2018-01-31T12:00:00Z' --output-topics my-topic \
            --max-findings-per-item 3 --max-findings 1000 \
            --info-types PHONE_NUMBER,EMAIL_ADDRESS \
            --min-likelihood very-likely --include-quote \
            --exclude-info-types

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PATH
        Google Cloud Storage URL to scan for files with optional wildcard
        character (*) -- for example, gs://my-bucket/*.

FLAGS
     --exclude-info-types
        Whether or not to exclude type information of the findings. Type
        information is included by default.

     --file-size-limit=FILE_SIZE_LIMIT; default=1024
        Integer indicating max number of bytes to scan from a file. If a
        scanned file's size is bigger than this value, then the rest of the
        bytes are omitted. The default value is 1024.

     --include-quote
        If True, a contextual quote from the data that triggered a finding is
        included in the response. Even if the content is not text, it may be
        converted to a textual representation in the response. For example,
        given the input value 'My phone number is (415) 555-0890' and a search
        for the infoType PHONE_NUMBER, the contextual quote would be '(415)
        555-0890.'

     --info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]
        Which infoTypes to scan input for. The values must correspond to
        infoType values found in documentation. For more information about
        valid infoTypes, see infoTypes Reference
        (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference)

     --job-id=JOB_ID
        Optional job ID to use for the created job. If not provided, a job ID
        will automatically be generated. Must be unique within the project. The
        job ID can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and
        hyphens; that is, it must match the regular expression: [a-zA-Z\\d-]+.
        The maximum length is 100 characters. Can be empty to allow the system
        to generate one.

     --max-findings=MAX_FINDINGS
        Maximum number of findings that will be returned per execution.

        If not specified, no limits are applied.

     --max-findings-per-item=MAX_FINDINGS_PER_ITEM
        Maximum number of findings that will be returned for each item scanned.

        If not specified, no limits are applied.

     --max-time=MAX_TIME
        Scan will include items in repository whose age is >= min-time and <=
        max-time.

        If max-time is omitted then there is no maximum time limit.

        See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time formats.

     --min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"
        Only return findings equal to or above this threshold. MIN_LIKELIHOOD
        must be one of: likely, possible, unlikely, very-likely, very-unlikely.

     --min-time=MIN_TIME
        Scan will include items in repository whose age is >= min-time and <=
        max-time.

        If max-time is omitted then there is no maximum time limit.

        See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time formats.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --output-table=OUTPUT_TABLE
          Publishes results of a Cloud DLP job a BigQuery table. BigQuery
          tables are uniquely identified by their project_id, dataset_id, and
          table_id in the format <project_id>.<dataset_id>.<table_id> or
          <project_id>.<dataset_id>.<table_id>. If no table_id is specified,
          DLP will create a table for you.

       --output-topics=[OUTPUT_TOPICS,...]
          Publishes the results of a Cloud DLP job to one or more Cloud Pub/Sub
          topics.

          Note: The topic must have given publishing access rights to the DLP
          API service account executing the Cloud DLP job.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the dlp/v2 API. The full documentation for this API can
    be found at: https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
