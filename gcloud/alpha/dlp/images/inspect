NAME
    gcloud alpha dlp images inspect - finds potentially sensitive data in image
        content

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dlp images inspect IMAGE [--exclude-info-types]
        [--include-quote] [--info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]]
        [--max-findings=MAX_FINDINGS]
        [--min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Finds potentially sensitive data in image content.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE
        Image file to search for sensitive info. The file type must be one of
        PNG, JPEG, SVG, or BMP.

FLAGS
     --exclude-info-types
        Whether or not to exclude type information of the findings. Type
        information is included by default.

     --include-quote
        If True, a contextual quote from the data that triggered a finding is
        included in the response. Even if the content is not text, it may be
        converted to a textual representation in the response. For example,
        given the input value 'My phone number is (415) 555-0890' and a search
        for the infoType PHONE_NUMBER, the contextual quote would be '(415)
        555-0890.'

     --info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]
        Which infoTypes to scan input for. The values must correspond to
        infoType values found in documentation. For more information about
        valid infoTypes, see infoTypes Reference
        (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference)

     --max-findings=MAX_FINDINGS
        Maximum number of findings that will be returned per execution.

        If not specified, no limits are applied.

     --min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"
        Only return findings equal to or above this threshold. MIN_LIKELIHOOD
        must be one of: likely, possible, unlikely, very-likely, very-unlikely.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
