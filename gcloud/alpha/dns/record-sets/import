NAME
    gcloud alpha dns record-sets import - import record-sets into your
        managed-zone

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dns record-sets import RECORDS_FILE --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
        [--delete-all-existing] [--location=LOCATION] [--replace-origin-ns]
        [--zone-file-format] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command imports record-sets contained within the specified
    record-sets file into your managed-zone. Note that NS records for the
    origin of the zone and the SOA NS field are not imported since name-servers
    are managed by Cloud DNS. By default, record-sets cannot be imported if
    there are any conflicts. A conflict exists if an existing record-set has
    the same name and type as a record-set that is being imported. In contrast,
    if the --delete-all-existing flag is used, the imported record-sets will
    replace all the records-sets currently in the managed-zone.

EXAMPLES
    To import record-sets from a yaml record-sets file, run:

        $ gcloud alpha dns record-sets import YAML_RECORDS_FILE \
            --zone=MANAGED_ZONE

    To import record-sets from a zone file, run:

        $ gcloud alpha dns record-sets import ZONE_FILE --zone-file-format \
            --zone=MANAGED_ZONE

    To replace all the record-sets in your zone with records from a yaml file,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha dns record-sets import YAML_RECORDS_FILE \
            --delete-all-existing --zone=MANAGED_ZONE

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RECORDS_FILE
        File from which record-sets should be imported. For examples of
        YAML-formatted and BIND zone-formatted records files, refer to
        https://cloud.google.com/dns/records#importing_and_exporting_record_sets

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
        Name of the managed zone whose record sets you want to manage.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --delete-all-existing
        Indicates that all existing record-sets should be deleted before
        importing the record-sets in the records-file.

     --location=LOCATION
        Specifies the desired service location the request is sent to. Defaults
        to Cloud DNS global service. Use --location=global if you want to
        target the global service.

     --replace-origin-ns
        Indicates that NS records for the origin of a zone should be imported
        if defined

     --zone-file-format
        Indicates that the input records-file is in BIND zone format. If
        omitted, indicates that the records-file is in YAML format.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud dns record-sets import

        $ gcloud beta dns record-sets import
