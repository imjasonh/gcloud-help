SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha scc assets run-discovery [ORGANIZATION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) Security Command Center Asset APIs are deprecated and
    will be removed on or after June 26, 2024. Use Cloud Asset Inventory
    instead (gcloud asset)
    (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/asset). For more
    information, see the deprecation notice at Assets Page
    (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-use-security-command-center#assets_page).

    Scan an organization for new/modified/deleted assets. Note that this API
    can only be called with limited frequency for an organization. If it is
    called too frequently the caller will receive a TOO_MANY_REQUESTS error.

EXAMPLES
    Run new scan for organization (123456):

        $ gcloud alpha scc assets run-discovery 123456

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Organization resource - The organization for which scan should be run.
     This represents a Cloud resource.

       [ORGANIZATION]
          ID of the organization or fully qualified identifier for the
          organization.

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument organization on the command line;
          ▸ Set the organization property in configuration using gcloud
            config set scc/organization if it is not specified in command
            line..

    this API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud scc assets run-discovery

        $ gcloud beta scc assets run-discovery
