DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) posture deployment.

    Fields specified in update-mask flag are updated. Updatable fields are
    description and posture_name with posture_revision-id. The target_resource
    for a posture deployment cannot be updated. The posture deployment to be
    updated should be in ACTIVE State. An empty or "" update-mask implies that
    posture-id and posture-revision-id are to be updated. If posture details of
    posture deployment need to be updated, then the desired posture needs to be
    in ACTIVE state. LRO operation ID is returned as the response of the
    command.

    foo-posture-deployment in the organization
