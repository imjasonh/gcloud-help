    gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules sha list - list the details of
        Security Health Analyics custom modules

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules sha list
        (--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --parent=PARENT
          | --project=PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER) [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List the details of the resident and inherited Security Health
    Analytics custom modules for the specified folder or project. For an
    organization, this command lists only the custom modules that are created
    at the organization level. Custom modules created in child folders or
    projects are not included in the list. To list the resident custom modules
    and the modules that are created in child folders or projects, use gcloud
    scc manage custom-modules sha list-descendant.

EXAMPLES
    To list resident and inherited Security Health Analytics custom modules for
    organization 123, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules sha list \
            --organization=organizations/123

    To list resident and inherited Security Health Analytics custom modules for
    folder 456, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules sha list \
            --folder=folders/456

    To list resident and inherited Security Health Analytics custom modules for
    project 789, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules sha list \
            --project=projects/789

    You can also specify the parent more generally:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules sha list 123456 \
            --parent=organizations/123

    Or just specify the fully qualified module name:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules sha list \
            organizations/123/locations/global/\
        securityHealthAnalyticsCustomModules/123456

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder associated with the custom module.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization associated with the custom module.

       --parent=PARENT
          Parent associated with the custom module. Can be one of
          organizations/<id>, projects/<id or name>, folders/<id>

       --project=PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER
          Project associated with the custom module.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud scc manage custom-modules sha list
