DESCRIPTION

EXAMPLES
    To delete an Event Threat Detection custom module with ID 123456 for
    organization 123, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules etd delete 123456 \
            --organization=123

    To delete a Event Threat Detection custom module with ID 123456 for folder
    456, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules etd delete 123456 \
            --folder=456

    To delete a Event Threat Detection custom module with ID 123456 for project
    789, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules etd delete 123456 \
            --project=789

    You can also specify the parent more generally:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules etd delete 123456 \
            --parent=organizations/123

    Or just specify the fully qualified module name:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage custom-modules etd delete \
            organizations/123/locations/global/\
        eventThreatDetectionCustomModules/123456

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     MODULE_ID_OR_NAME
        The custom module ID or name. The expected format is
        {parent}/[locations/global]/eventThreatDetectionCustomModules/{module_id}
        or just {module_id}. Where module_id is a numeric identifier 1-20
        characters in length. Parent is of the form organizations/{id},
        projects/{id or name}, folders/{id}.

FLAGS
     --validate-only
        If present, the request is validated (including IAM checks) but no
        action is taken.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder associated with the custom module.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization associated with the custom module.

       --parent=PARENT
          Parent associated with the custom module. Can be one of
          organizations/<id>, projects/<id or name>, folders/<id>

       --project=PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER
          Project associated with the custom module.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud scc manage custom-modules etd delete
