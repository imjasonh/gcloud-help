DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List the details of Security Command Center services for the
    specified folder, project or organization. Services along with their
    corresponding module information is returned as the response.

EXAMPLES
    To list the Security Center services for organization 123, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services list \
            --organization=organizations/123

    To list Security Center services for folder 456, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services list --folder=folders/456

    To list Security Center services for project 789, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services list --project=projects/789

    You can also specify the parent more generally:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services list --parent=organizations/123

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder associated with the Security Center service.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization associated with the Security Center service.

       --parent=PARENT
          Parent associated with the Security Center service. Can be one of
          organizations/<id>, projects/<id or name>, folders/<id>

       --project=PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER
          Project associated with the Security Center service.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud scc manage services list
