SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha scc manage services describe SERVICE_NAME

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Get the details of a Security Command Center service. It resolves
    INHERITED enablement states to ENABLED or DISABLED for services at ancestor
    levels. For example, if the service is enabled at the ancestor level,
    services for all child resources will have the enablement state set to
    ENABLED.

    organization 123, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services describe sha --organization=123

    To get the details of a Security Command Center service with name sha for
    folder 456, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services describe sha --folder=456

    To get the details of a Security Command Center service with ID sha for
    project 789, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services describe sha --project=789

    You can also specify the parent more generally:

            --parent=organizations/123

    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud scc manage services describe
