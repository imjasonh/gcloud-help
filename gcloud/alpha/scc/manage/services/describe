SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha scc manage services describe SERVICE_NAME

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Get the details of a Security Command Center service. It resolves
    INHERITED enablement states to ENABLED or DISABLED for services at ancestor
    levels. For example, if the service is enabled at the ancestor level,
    services for all child resources will have the enablement state set to
    ENABLED.

EXAMPLES
    To get the details of a Security Command Center service with name sha for
    organization 123, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services describe sha --organization=123

    To get the details of a Security Command Center service with name sha for
    folder 456, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services describe sha --folder=456

    To get the details of a Security Command Center service with ID sha for
    project 789, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services describe sha --project=789

    You can also specify the parent more generally:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services describe sha \
            --parent=organizations/123

    To get the details of modules, [ABC, DEF] of a Security Command Center
    service with name sha for organization 123, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc manage services describe sha \
            --module-list=[ABC, DEF] --organization=123

        The list of supported services is:

        ◆ security-health-analytics (can be abbreviated as sha)

        ◆ event-threat-detection (can be abbreviated as etd)

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud scc manage services describe
