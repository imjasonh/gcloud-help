       --project=PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER
          Project associated with the custom module.

        If present, the request is validated (including IAM checks) but no
        action is taken.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud scc manage services update
