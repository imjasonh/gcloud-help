        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Export Security Command Center findings to bigquery.

EXAMPLES
    To export findings for a given parent
    ``organizations/123/sources/456/locations/global`` and dataset
    ``projects/project_id/datasets/dataset_id`` run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc findings export-to-bigquery organizations/123 \
            --dataset=projects/project_id/datasets/dataset_id --source=456 \
            --location=global

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Parent resource - parent organization, folder, or project in the Google
     Cloud resource hierarchy to be used for the gcloud scc command. Specify
     the argument as either [RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_ID] or [RESOURCE_ID], as
     shown in the preceding examples. This represents a Cloud resource.

       [PARENT]
          ID of the parent or fully qualified identifier for the parent.

          To set the parent attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument parent on the command line;
          ▸ Set the parent property in configuration using gcloud config set
            scc/parent if it is not specified in command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --dataset=DATASET
        BigQuery dataset to export findings to.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the
        location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location
        attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name
        or with the --location argument on the command line. The default
        location is global. NOTE: If you override the endpoint to a regional
        endpoint
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/index.html?rep_location=global#regional-service-endpoint)
        you must specify the correct data location
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/data-residency-support#locations)
        using this flag. The default location on this command is unrelated to
        the default location that is specified when data residency controls are
        enabled for Security Command Center.

     --source=SOURCE; default="-"
        Source id. Defaults to all sources.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud scc findings export-to-bigquery
