            --organization=123456 --source=5678

    List all security marks for testFinding under project example-project and

        $ gcloud alpha scc findings list-marks \
            projects/example-project/sources/5678/findings/testFinding

    List all security marks for testFinding under folder 456 and source 5678:

        $ gcloud alpha scc findings list-marks \
            folders/456/sources/5678/findings/testFinding

    List all security marks for testFinding under organization 123456, source
    5678 and location=eu:

        $ gcloud alpha scc findings list-marks `testFinding` \
            --organization=123456 --source=5678 --location=eu

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FINDING
        ID of the finding or fully qualified identifier for the finding.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the
        location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location
        attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name
        or with the --location argument on the command line. The default
        location is global.

        NOTE: If you override the endpoint to a regional endpoint
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/index.html?rep_location=global#regional-service-endpoint)
        you must specify the correct data location
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/data-residency-support#locations)
        using this flag. The default location on this command is unrelated to
        the default location that is specified when data residency controls are
        enabled for Security Command Center.

        NOTE: If no location is specified, the default location is global AND
        the request will be routed to the SCC V1 API. To use the SCC V2 API -
        please explicitly specify the flag.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        Response objects will return a non-null value for page-token to
        indicate that there is at least one additional page of data. User can
        either directly request that page by specifying the page-token
        explicitly or let gcloud fetch one-page-at-a-time.

     --read-time=READ_TIME
        (DEPRECATED) Time used as a reference point when filtering. Absence of
        this field will default to the API's version of NOW. See $ gcloud topic
        datetimes for information on supported time formats.

        The --read-time option is deprecated. For more information, see the
        deprecation notice
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/release-notes#April_15_2024)
        on the SCC release notes page.

     --source=SOURCE; default="-"
        Source id. Defaults to all sources.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          The folder ID (e.g., 456) that contains the finding.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization ID (e.g., 123) that contains the finding.

       --project=PROJECT
          The project ID (e.g., example-project) that contains the finding.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the Security Command Center API. For more information,
    see Security Command Center API.
    (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest)

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud scc findings list-marks

        $ gcloud beta scc findings list-marks
