NAME
    gcloud alpha scc notifications list - list Security Command Center
        notification configs

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha scc notifications list [PARENT]
        [--location=LOCATION; default="global"]
        [--folder=FOLDER | --organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List Security Command Center notification configs.

        Notification Configs that are created with Security Command Center API V2
        and later include a `location` attribute. Include the `--location` flag to
        list Notification Configs with `location` attribute other than `global`.

EXAMPLES
    List notification configs from organization 123

        $ gcloud alpha scc notifications list 123
        $ gcloud alpha scc notifications list organizations/123

    List notification configs from folder 456

        $ gcloud alpha scc notifications list folders/456

    List notification configs from project 789

        $ gcloud alpha scc notifications list projects/789

    List notification configs from organization 123 and location=eu

        $ gcloud alpha scc notifications list 123 --location=eu
        $ gcloud alpha scc notifications list organizations/123 \
            --location=locations/eu

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Parent resource - parent organization, folder, or project in the Google
     Cloud resource hierarchy to be used for the gcloud scc command. Specify
     the argument as either [RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_ID] or [RESOURCE_ID], as
     shown in the preceding examples. This represents a Cloud resource.

       [PARENT]
          ID of the parent or fully qualified identifier for the parent.

          To set the parent attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument parent on the command line;
          ▸ Set the parent property in configuration using gcloud config set
            scc/parent if it is not specified in command line.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        Required if either data residency is enabled or the notificationConfig
        resources were created by using the API v2.

        If data residency is enabled, specify the Security Command Center
        location in which the notifications are stored.

        If data residency is not enabled, including /locations/``LOCATION'' in
        the name or the --location flag in the command lists only the
        notificationConfig resources that were created by using the Security
        Command Center API v2 and the only valid location is global.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          Folder where the notification config resides. Formatted as
          folders/456 or just 456.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Organization where the notification config resides. Formatted as
          organizations/123 or just 123.

       --project=PROJECT
          Project (ID or number) where the notification config resides.
          Formatted as projects/789 or just 789.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud scc notifications list

        $ gcloud beta scc notifications list
