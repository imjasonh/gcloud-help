    gcloud alpha scc postures update - update the given Cloud Security Command
        Center posture

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha scc postures update
        (POSTURE : --location=LOCATION --organization=ORGANIZATION)
        --posture-from-file=POSTURE_FROM_FILE --revision-id=REVISION_ID
        [--async] [--update-mask=UPDATE_MASK] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) posture.

    Fields specified in update-mask flag are updated. Updatable fields are
    state, description and policy_sets. State of the posture can't be updated
    along with update of other fields. An empty or "" as field mask will result
    in update of policy_sets and description. In case of the update of
    policy_sets, the value mentioned in the update posture request overwrites
    the exisiting value of policy_sets.

    Valid state transitions are: a) ACTIVE to DRAFT b) ACTIVE to DEPRECATED c)
    DRAFT to ACTIVE d) DEPRECATED to ACTIVE

    The update operation will result in the update of the revision-id specified
    in the request, unless the posture revision is currently deployed on a
    workload. A new revision is created for an already deployed posture
    revision.

EXAMPLES
    Update the revision-id abcdefgh of the posture named foo-posture in the
    organization organizations/123/locations/global: Change State to ACTIVE.        $ gcloud alpha scc postures update \
