    gcloud alpha scc postures list - lists all the Cloud Security Command
        Center postures for an organization

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha scc postures list PARENT [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Lists all Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) postures for an
    organization.

    By default, postures created in global location are returned.

EXAMPLES
    List all postures in organization 123. If location is omitted, this returns
    postures from location 'global'. For a posture with multiple revisions,
    only the latest revision of the posture is returned in the output.

        $ gcloud alpha scc postures list organizations/123

    List all postures in organization 123, location global

        $ gcloud alpha scc postures list organizations/123/locations/global

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PARENT
        Resource name of the parent, like organizations/<organizationID> or
        organizations/<organizationID>/locations/<location>.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
