DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Lists all the Cloud Security Command Center postures for an
    organization.

EXAMPLES
    To list all the Cloud Security Command Center postures for an organization
    123 and in the global location, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc postures list organizations/123/locations/global

        $ gcloud alpha scc postures list --organization=123 --location=global

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       [PARENT]
          Parent the Cloud Security Command Center postures belongs to.
          Formatted as organizations/<organizationID>/locations/<location>.

       Specify organization and location using flags.

         --location=LOCATION
            When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies
            the location in which the resource is located and applicable.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --organization=ORGANIZATION
            The organization ID (e.g., 123) that contains the resource.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
