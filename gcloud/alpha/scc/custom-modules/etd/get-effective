NAME
    gcloud alpha scc custom-modules etd get-effective - get the details of a
        Event Threat Detection custom module with effective enablement state

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha scc custom-modules etd get-effective CUSTOM_MODULE
        [--folder=FOLDER | --organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Get the details of a Event Threat Detection custom module. For
    inherited custom modules, the get-effective command resolves INHERITED
    enablement states to ENABLED or DISABLED. For example, if an inherited
    custom module is enabled at the ancestor level, then the get-effective
    command displays the enablement state as ENABLED instead of INHERITED in a
    child folder or project.

EXAMPLES
    To get the details of a Event Threat Detection custom module 123456 with
    its effective enablement state from organization 123, run:

        $ gcloud alpha scc custom-modules etd get-effective 123456 \
            --organization=organizations/123

    To get the details of a Event Threat Detection custom module 123456 with
    its effective enablement state from folder 456, run:

            --folder=folders/456

    To get the details of a Event Threat Detection custom module 123456 with
