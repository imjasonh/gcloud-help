NAME
    gcloud alpha transfer agents delete - delete a Transfer Service transfer
        agents

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha transfer agents delete [--ids=[IDS,...] | --all | --uninstall]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete agents and remove agent resources from your machine.

EXAMPLES
    If you plan to delete specific agents, you can list which agents are
    running on your machine by running:

        $ docker container list --all \
            --filter ancestor=gcr.io/cloud-ingest/tsop-agent

    Then run:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer agents delete --ids=id1,id2,...

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --ids=[IDS,...]
          The IDs of the agents you want to delete. Separate multiple agent IDs
          with commas, with no spaces following the commas.

       --all
          Delete all agents running on your machine.

       --uninstall
          Fully uninstall the agent Docker image in addition to deleting the
          agents. Uninstalling the Docker image will free up space, but you'll
          need to reinstall it to run agents on this machine in the future.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud transfer agents delete
