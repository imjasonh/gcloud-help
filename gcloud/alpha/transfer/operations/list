DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List Transfer Service transfer operations to view their progress
    details at a glance.

EXAMPLES
    To list all transfer operations in your current project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer operations list

    To list all failed operations in your project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer operations list --operation-statuses=failed

    To list operations 'foo' and 'bar', run:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer operations list --operation-names=foo,bar

    To list all operations in your current project as JSON, which provides all
    fields and formatting available in the API, run:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer operations list --format=json

FLAGS
     --limit=LIMIT
        Return the first items from the API up to this limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE; default=256
        Retrieve batches of this many items from the API.

     --job-names=[JOB_NAMES,...]
        The names of the jobs whose operations you want to list. Separate
        multiple job names with commas (e.g., --job-names=foo,bar). If not
        specified, operations for all jobs are listed.

     --operation-names=[OPERATION_NAMES,...]
        The names of operations you want to list. Separate multiple operation
        names with commas (e.g., --operation-names-name=foo,bar). If not
        specified, all operations are listed.

     --operation-statuses=[OPERATION_STATUSES,...]
        List only transfer operations with the statuses you specify. Options
        include 'in_progress', 'paused', 'success','failed', 'aborted'.
        Separate multiple statuses with commas (e.g.,
        --operation-statuses=failed,aborted).

     --expand-table
        Include additional table columns (operation name, start time, status,
        data copied, status, has errors, job name) in command output. Tip:
        increase the size of your terminal before running the command.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud transfer operations list
