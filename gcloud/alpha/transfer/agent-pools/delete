NAME
    gcloud alpha transfer agent-pools delete - delete a Transfer Service agent
        pool

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha transfer agent-pools delete NAME [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete an agent pool. Note that before you can delete a pool, all
    the pool's agents must be stopped, its associated jobs must be disabled,
    and there must be no associated in-progress transfer operations.

EXAMPLES
    To delete agent pool 'foo', run:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer agent-pools delete foo

    To check if there are active operations associated with a pool before
    deleting it, scroll through the results of:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer operations list --format=yaml \
            --operation-statuses=in_progress

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the job you want to delete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud transfer agent-pools delete
