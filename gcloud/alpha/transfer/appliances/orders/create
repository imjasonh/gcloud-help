DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha transfer appliances orders create facilitates the
    creation of Transfer Appliance orders. When an order is created, an
    appliance record is created as well.

EXAMPLES
    To order a rackable appliance with 40 TB of storage, named my-appliance, a
    Cloud Storage destination of my-bucket and the minimum amount of contact
    information.

        $ gcloud alpha transfer appliances orders create my-appliance \
            --model=TA40_RACKABLE \
            --shipping-contact="name=Jane \
        Doe,emails=[jane@example.com],phone=12345678910" \
            --offline-import=gs://my-bucket \
            --order-contact="name=John \
        Doe,phone=123456578910,emails=[john@example.com]" --country=US \
            --address="lines=['1600 Amphitheatre \
        Parkway'],locality=Mountain \
        View,administrative-area=CA,postal-code=94043"

    To clone an appliance order with the ID my-appliance and location
    us-central1, only changing the name and Cloud Storage destination:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer appliances orders create \
            my-other-appliance --country=US --clone=my-appliance \
            --clone-region=us-central1 --offline-import=my-other-bucket

    To use a flags file to create an appliance rather than provide a long list
    of flags:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer appliances orders create my-appliance \
            --flags-file=FLAGS_FILE

    Example file with all possible flags set:

            SOURCE_PATH/object1.pdf, manifest will have object1.pdf in the
            first column, followed by object version (optional). For more
