NAME
    gcloud alpha transfer authorize - authorize an account for all Transfer
        Service features

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha transfer authorize [--add-missing] [--creds-file=CREDS_FILE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Authorize a Google account for all Transfer Service features.

    This command provides admin and owner rights for simplicity. If that's too
    much authority for your use case, see custom setups here:
    https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/on-prem-set-up

EXAMPLES
    To see what Transfer Service IAM roles the account logged into gcloud may
    be missing, run:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer authorize

    To add the missing IAM roles, run:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer authorize --add-missing

    To check a custom service account for missing roles, run:

        $ gcloud alpha transfer authorize \
            --creds-file=path/to/service-account-key.json

FLAGS
     --add-missing
        Add IAM roles necessary to use all Transfer Service features to the
        specified account. By default, this command just prints missing roles.

     --creds-file=CREDS_FILE
        The path to the creds file for an account to authorize. The file should
        be in JSON format and contain a "type" and "client_email", which are
        automatically generated for most creds files downloaded from Google
        (e.g. service account tokens). If this flag is not present, the command
        authorizes the user currently logged into gcloud.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
