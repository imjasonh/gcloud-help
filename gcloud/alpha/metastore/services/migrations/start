API REFERENCE
    This command uses the metastore/v1alpha API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-metastore/docs

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:
