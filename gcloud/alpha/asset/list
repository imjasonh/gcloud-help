NAME
    gcloud alpha asset list - list the Cloud assets

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha asset list
        (--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID) [--asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]]
        [--content-type=CONTENT_TYPE]
        [--relationship-types=[RELATIONSHIP_TYPES,...]]
        [--snapshot-time=SNAPSHOT_TIME] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List the Cloud assets. Note that to list a project different from
    the project you want to bill, you can use --billing-project or authenticate
    with a service account. See
    https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/gcloud-asset
    for examples of using a service account.

EXAMPLES
    To list a snapshot of assets of type 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' in
    project 'test-project' at '2019-03-05T00:00:00Z', run:

        $ gcloud alpha asset list --project='test-project' \
            --asset-types='compute.googleapis.com/Disk' \
            --snapshot-time='2019-03-05T00:00:00Z'

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The ID of the folder which is the root asset.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The ID of the organization which is the root asset.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The project which is the root asset.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

FLAGS
     --asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]
        A list of asset types (i.e., "compute.googleapis.com/Disk") to take a
        snapshot. If specified and non-empty, only assets matching the
        specified types will be returned. See
        http://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types for
        supported asset types.

     --content-type=CONTENT_TYPE
        Asset content type. If not specified, no content but the asset name and
        type will be returned in the feed. For more information, see
        https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/reference/rest/v1/feeds#ContentType.
        CONTENT_TYPE must be one of: resource, iam-policy, org-policy,
        access-policy, os-inventory, relationship.

     --relationship-types=[RELATIONSHIP_TYPES,...]
        A list of relationship types (i.e., "INSTANCE_TO_INSTANCEGROUP") to
        take a snapshot. This argument will only be honoured if
        content_type=RELATIONSHIP. If specified and non-empty, only
        relationships matching the specified types will be returned. See
        http://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types for
        supported relationship types.

     --snapshot-time=SNAPSHOT_TIME
        Timestamp to take a snapshot on assets. This can only be a current or
        past time. If not specified, the current time will be used. Due to
        delays in resource data collection and indexing, there is a volatile
        window during which running the same query at different times may
        return different results. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information
        on time formats.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud asset list

        $ gcloud beta asset list
