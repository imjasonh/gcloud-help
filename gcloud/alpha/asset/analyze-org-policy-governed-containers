NAME
    gcloud alpha asset analyze-org-policy-governed-containers - analyze
        organization policies governed containers under a scope

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha asset analyze-org-policy-governed-containers
        --constraint=CONSTRAINT --scope=SCOPE [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Analyze organization policies governed containers under a scope.

EXAMPLES
    To list 10 containers governed by a constraint in an organization, run:

        $ gcloud alpha asset analyze-org-policy-governed-containers \
            --scope=organizations/YOUR_ORG_ID \
            --constraint=YOUR_CONSTRAINT_NAME --limit=10

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --constraint=CONSTRAINT
        The name of the constraint to analyze organization policies for. The
        response only contains analyzed organization policies for the provided
        constraint.

        Examples:

        ◆ ``organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER}/customConstraints/{CUSTOM_CONSTRAINT_NAME}
          for a user-defined custom constraint.

     --scope=SCOPE
        Scope can be a project, a folder, or an organization. The analysis is
        limited to the Cloud org policies and containers within this scope. The
        caller must be granted the cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources
        permission on the desired scope.

        The allowed values are:

        ◆ projects/{PROJECT_ID} (e.g., projects/foo-bar)
        ◆ projects/{PROJECT_NUMBER} (e.g., projects/12345678)
        ◆ folders/{FOLDER_NUMBER} (e.g., folders/1234567)
        ◆ organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER} (e.g. organizations/123456)

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
