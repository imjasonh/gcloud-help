NAME
    gcloud alpha asset feeds delete - delete a Cloud Asset Inventory Feed

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha asset feeds delete FEED_ID
        (--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a Cloud Asset Inventory Feed.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a feed 'feed1' in project 'p1', run:

        $ gcloud alpha asset feeds delete feed1 --project=p1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FEED_ID
        Asset feed identifier to delete.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the feed.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the feed.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          project of the feed.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud asset feeds delete

        $ gcloud beta asset feeds delete
