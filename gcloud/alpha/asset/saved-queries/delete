NAME
    gcloud alpha asset saved-queries delete - delete a Cloud Asset Inventory
        saved query

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha asset saved-queries delete QUERY_ID
        (--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a Cloud Asset Inventory saved query.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a saved query with id 'query1' in project 'p1', run:

        $ gcloud alpha asset saved-queries delete query1 --project=p1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     QUERY_ID
        Asset saved query identifier to be deleted. It must be unique under the
        specified parent resource project/folder/organization.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the saved query.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the saved query.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the saved query.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud asset saved-queries delete

        $ gcloud beta asset saved-queries delete
