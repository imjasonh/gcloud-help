NAME
    gcloud alpha asset query - query the CloudAssets

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha asset query
        (--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID) [--job-reference=JOB_REFERENCE]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--page-token=PAGE_TOKEN]
        [--statement=STATEMENT] [--timeout=TIMEOUT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Issue an analytical query on Cloud assets using BigQuery Standard
    SQL compatible statement.

EXAMPLES
    To count the number of compute instance, run:

        $ gcloud alpha asset query --project='test-project' \
            --statement='SELECT * FROM compute_googleapis_com_Instance'

    To see the query result of previous job, pass the job-reference from
    previous response:

        $ gcloud alpha asset query --project='test-project' \
            --job-reference=<job-reference-from>

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The ID of the folder which is the root asset.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The ID of the organization which is the root asset.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The project which is the root asset.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --job-reference=JOB_REFERENCE
        Reference to the query job, which is from the previous call.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        The maximum number of rows to return in the results. Other than that,
        one page is also limited to 10 MB.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        A page token received from previous call.

     --statement=STATEMENT
        A BigQuery Standard SQL compatible statement. If the query
        executionfinishes within timeout and there is no pagination, the full
        queryresults will be returned. Otherwise, pass job_reference from
        previous call as --job-referrence to obtain the full results.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        Maximum amount of time that the client is willing to wait for the query
        to complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
