          | --sub-folder=SUB_FOLDER)
        (--inherit-from-parent
          | --exclude-bucket-id-regexes=[EXCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]
          --exclude-bucket-ids=[EXCLUDE_BUCKET_IDS,...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) This command group is deprecated. Use gcloud alpha
    storage intelligence-configs command group instead.

    Update management hub plan for the organization, sub-folder or project.

EXAMPLES
    To limit buckets in the management hub plan, Use the following command with
    --include-bucket-ids and --include-bucket-regexes flags to specify list of
    bucket ids and bucket id regexes.,

        $gcloud alpha storage management-hub update --organization=my-org --include-bucket-ids=my-bucket --include-bucket-regexes=my-bucket-.*

    To apply location based filters in the management hub plan, Use
    --include-locations or --exclude-locations flags to specify allowed list of
    locations or excluded list of locations. The following command updates
    management hub plan of sub-folder 123456 with the specified list of
    excluded locations.,

        $gcloud alpha storage management-hub update --sub-folder=123456 --exclude-locations=us-east1,us-west1

    The following command updates management hub for the given project by
    inheriting existing management hub plan from the hierarchical parent
    resource.,

        $gcloud alpha storage management-hub update --project=my-project --inherit-from-parent

    To clear included locations from the project management hub, Use the
    following command.,

        $gcloud alpha storage management-hub update --project=my-project --include-locations=

    To clear excluded bucket ids from the project management hub and to replace
    existing excluded bucket ids regexes, Use the following command.,

        $gcloud alpha storage management-hub update --project=my-project --exclude-bucket-id-regexes="test1*","test2*" --exclude-bucket-ids=""

    Alternatively, use the following command to do same operation since the
    absense of cloud storage bucket filter flags will be considered as empty
    list,

        $gcloud alpha storage management-hub update --project=my-project --exclude-bucket-id-regexes="test1*","test2*"

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Specifies organization id for the management hub.

       --project=PROJECT
          Specifies project for the management hub.

       --sub-folder=SUB_FOLDER
          Specifies sub-folder id for the management hub.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --inherit-from-parent
          Specifies management hub config to be inherited from parent.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         Sets the cloud storage buckets exclusion filter. Full filters should
         be specified using available flags in this group, gcloud CLI infers
         missing flags of this group as empty which will result in clearing of
         the individual filters.

           --exclude-bucket-id-regexes=[EXCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]
              Sets filter for bucket id regexes to exclude. Accepts list of
              bucket id regexes in comma separated format. If the regex
              contains special characters that may have a specific meaning in
              the shell, escape them using backslashes(\). To clear bucket id
              regexes list, provide flag with an empty list. e.g
              --exclude-bucket-id-regexes="" or --exclude-bucket-id-regexes= .

           --exclude-bucket-ids=[EXCLUDE_BUCKET_IDS,...]
              Comma separated list of bucket ids to exclude in the management
              hub filter. To clear bucket id list, provide flag with an empty
              list. e.g --exclude-bucket-ids="" or --exclude-bucket-ids= .

         Sets the cloud storage buckets inclusion filter. Full filters should
         be specified using available flags in this group, gcloud CLI infers
         missing flags of this group as empty which will result in clearing of
         the individual filters.

           --include-bucket-id-regexes=[INCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]
              Sets filter for bucket id regexes to include. Accepts list of
              bucket id regexes in comma separated format. If the regex
              contains special characters that may have a specific meaning in
              the shell, escape them using backslashes(\). To clear bucket id
              regexes list, provide flag with empty list. e.g
              --include-bucket-id-regexes="" or --include-bucket-id-regexes= .

           --include-bucket-ids=[INCLUDE_BUCKET_IDS,...]
              Comma separated list of bucket ids to include in the management
              hub filter. To clear bucket id list, provide flag with empty

         --exclude-locations=[EXCLUDE_LOCATIONS,...]
            Comma separated list of locations
            (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#available-locations)
            to exclude in Management Hub filter. To clear excluded locations,

            --exclude-locations= .

         --include-locations=[INCLUDE_LOCATIONS,...]
            Comma separated list of locations
            (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#available-locations)

            --include-locations= .

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
