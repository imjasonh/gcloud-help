DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Enable management hub plan for the organization, sub-folder or
    project along with filters.

EXAMPLES
    To remove buckets from the management hub plan, Use the following command
    with --exclude-bucket-ids and --exclude-bucket-regexes flags to specify
    list of bucket ids and bucket id regexes.,

        $gcloud alpha storage management-hub enable --organization=my-org --exclude-bucket-ids="my-bucket" --exclude-bucket-regexes="my-bucket-.*"

    To apply location based filters in the management hub plan, Use
    --include-locations or --exclude-locations flags to specify allowed list of
    locations or excluded list of locations. The following command updates
    management hub plan of sub-folder 123456 with the specified list of
    included locations.,

        $gcloud alpha storage management-hub enable --sub-folder=123456 --include-locations="us-east1","us-west1"

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --organization=ORGANIZATION

          Comma separated list of locations
          (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#available-locations)to
          exclude in Management Hub filter. To clear excluded locations,
          provide flag with empty list. e.g --exclude-locations="" or
          --exclude-locations= .

       --include-locations=[INCLUDE_LOCATIONS,...]
          Comma separated list of locations
          (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#available-locations)
          to include in management hub filter. To clear included locations,

          --include-locations= .

BUCKET_FILTER FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       Sets the cloud storage buckets exclusion filter. Full filters should be
       specified using available flags in this group, gcloud CLI infers missing

       individual filters.

         --exclude-bucket-id-regexes=[EXCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]
            Sets filter for bucket id regexes to exclude. Accepts list of
            bucket id regexes in comma separated format. If the regex contains
            special characters that may have a specific meaning in the shell
            (like $, &, , etc.), escape them using backslashes(\). To clear
            bucket id regexes list, provide flag with an empty list. e.g
            --exclude-bucket-id-regexes="" or --exclude-bucket-id-regexes= .

         --exclude-bucket-ids=[EXCLUDE_BUCKET_IDS,...]
            Comma separated list of bucket ids to exclude in the management hub
            filter. To clear bucket id list, provide flag with an empty list.
            e.g --exclude-bucket-ids="" or --exclude-bucket-ids= .

       Sets the cloud storage buckets inclusion filter. Full filters should be
       specified using available flags in this group, gcloud CLI infers missing
       flags of this group as empty which will result in clearing of the
       individual filters.

         --include-bucket-id-regexes=[INCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]
            Sets filter for bucket id regexes to include. Accepts list of
            bucket id regexes in comma separated format. If the regex contains
            special characters that may have a specific meaning in the shell
            (like $, &, , etc.), escape them using backslashes(\). To clear
            bucket id regexes list, provide flag with empty list. e.g
            --include-bucket-id-regexes="" or --include-bucket-id-regexes= .

         --include-bucket-ids=[INCLUDE_BUCKET_IDS,...]
            Comma separated list of bucket ids to include in the management hub
            filter. To clear bucket id list, provide flag with empty list. e.g
