NAME
    gcloud alpha storage cat - outputs the contents of one or more URLs to
        stdout

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage cat URL [URL ...] [--display-url, -d]
        [--range=RANGE, -r RANGE] [--decryption-keys=[DECRYPTION_KEY,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The cat command outputs the contents of one or more URLs to stdout.
    While the cat command does not compute a checksum, it is otherwise
    equivalent to doing:

        $ gcloud alpha storage cp url... -

    (The final '-' causes gcloud to stream the output to stdout.)

EXAMPLES
    The following command writes all text files in a bucket to stdout:

        $ gcloud alpha storage cat gs://bucket/*.txt

    The following command outputs a short header describing file.txt, along
    with its contents:

        $ gcloud alpha storage cat -d gs://my-bucket/file.txt

    The following command outputs bytes 256-939 of file.txt:

        $ gcloud alpha storage cat -r 256-939 gs://my-bucket/file.txt

    The following command outputs the last 5 bytes of file.txt:

        $ gcloud alpha storage cat -r -5 gs://my-bucket/file.txt

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL [URL ...]
        The url of objects to list.

FLAGS
     --display-url, -d
        Prints the header before each object.

     --range=RANGE, -r RANGE
        Causes gcloud storage to output just the specified byte range of the
        object. In a case where "start" = 'x', and "end" = 'y', ranges take the
        form: x-y (e.g., -r 256-5939), x- (e.g., -r 256-), -y (e.g., -r -5)

        When offsets start at 0, x-y means to return bytes x through y
        (inclusive), x- means to return bytes x through the end of the object,
        and -y changes the role of y. If -y is present, then it returns the
        last y bytes of the object.

        If the bytes are out of range of the object, then nothing is printed

ENCRYPTION FLAGS
     --decryption-keys=[DECRYPTION_KEY,...]
        A comma-separated list of customer-supplied encryption keys (RFC 4648
        section 4 base64-encoded AES256 strings) that will be used to decrypt
        Google Cloud Storage objects. Data encrypted with a customer-managed
        encryption key (CMEK) is decrypted automatically, so CMEKs do not need
        to be listed here.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud storage cat
