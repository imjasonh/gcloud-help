DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List Cloud Storage objects.

    Bucket URLs like gs://bucket match all the objects inside a bucket, but
    gs://b* fails because it matches a list of buckets.

EXAMPLES
    List all objects in bucket my-bucket within current directory level:

        $ gcloud alpha storage objects list gs://my-bucket

    List all objects across nested directories using wildcards
    (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/wildcards):

        $ gcloud alpha storage objects list gs://my-bucket/**

    List all objects in bucket beginning with ``o'':

        $ gcloud alpha storage objects list gs://my-bucket/o*

    List all objects in bucket with JSON formatting, only returning the value
    of the name metadata field:

        $ gcloud alpha storage objects list gs://my-bucket \
            --format="json(name)"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URLS [URLS ...]
        Specifies URL of objects to list.

FLAGS
     --additional-headers=HEADER=VALUE
        Includes arbitrary headers in storage API calls. Accepts a comma
        separated list of key=value pairs, e.g. header1=value1,header2=value2.
        Overrides the default storage/additional_headers property value for
        this command invocation.

     --exhaustive
        For features like soft delete, the API may return an empty list. If
        present, continue querying. This may incur costs from repeated LIST
        calls and may not return any additional objects.

     --fetch-encrypted-object-hashes
        API requests to the LIST endpoint do not fetch the hashes for encrypted
        objects by default. If this flag is set, a GET request is sent for each
        encrypted object in order to fetch hashes. This can significantly
        increase the cost of the command.

     --next-page-token=NEXT_PAGE_TOKEN
        Page token for resuming LIST calls.

     --raw
        Shows metadata in the format returned by the API instead of
        standardizing it.

     --soft-deleted
        Displays soft-deleted resources only. For objects, it will exclude live
        and noncurrent ones.

     --stat
        Emulates gsutil stat-style behavior. Does not show past object versions
        and changes output format.

ENCRYPTION FLAGS
     --decryption-keys=[DECRYPTION_KEY,...]
        A comma-separated list of customer-supplied encryption keys (RFC 4648
        section 4 base64-encoded AES256 strings) that will be used to decrypt
        Cloud Storage objects. Data encrypted with a customer-managed
        encryption key (CMEK) is decrypted automatically, so CMEKs do not need
        to be listed here.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud storage objects list
