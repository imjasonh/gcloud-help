            gs://bucket/b.txt gs://bucket/target.txt

        object.

     DESTINATION

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct

    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud storage objects compose
