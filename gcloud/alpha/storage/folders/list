NAME
    gcloud alpha storage folders list - list folders

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage folders list URL [URL ...]
        [--additional-headers=HEADER=VALUE] [--raw] [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List folders.

EXAMPLES
    The following command lists all folders in a hierarchical namespace bucket:

        $ gcloud alpha storage folders list gs://my-bucket/

    The following command lists all folders under a parent folder:

        $ gcloud alpha storage folders list gs://my-bucket/parent-folder/

    You can use wildcards (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/wildcards) to
    match multiple paths (including multiple buckets). Bucket wildcards are
    expanded to match only buckets contained in your current project. The
    following command matches folders that are stored in buckets in your
    project that begin with my-b:

        $ gcloud alpha storage folders list gs://my-b*/

    Following is another example where we are listing all folders that begin
    with ``B'' under a given bucket:

        $ gcloud alpha storage folders list gs://my-bucket/B*

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL [URL ...]
        The URLs of the resources to list.

FLAGS
     --additional-headers=HEADER=VALUE
        Includes arbitrary headers in storage API calls. Accepts a comma
        separated list of key=value pairs, e.g. header1=value1,header2=value2.
        Overrides the default storage/additional_headers property value for
        this command invocation.

     --raw
        Shows metadata in the format returned by the API instead of
        standardizing it.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud storage folders list
