NAME
    gcloud alpha storage rm - delete objects and buckets

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage rm [URLS ...] [--all-versions, -a]
        [--continue-on-error] [--if-generation-match=GENERATION]
        [--if-metageneration-match=METAGENERATION] [--recursive, -R, -r]
        [--stdin, -I] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete objects and buckets.

EXAMPLES
    The following command deletes a Cloud Storage object named my-object from
    the bucket my-bucket:

        $ gcloud alpha storage rm gs://my-bucket/my-object

    The following command deletes all objects directly within the directory
    my-dir but no objects within subdirectories:

        $ gcloud alpha storage rm gs://my-bucket/my-dir/*

    The following command deletes all objects and subdirectories within the
    directory my-dir:

        $ gcloud alpha storage rm gs://my-bucket/my-dir/**

    Note that for buckets that contain versioned objects
    (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning), the above
    command only affects live versions. Use the --recursive flag instead to
    delete all versions.

    The following command deletes all versions of all resources in my-bucket
    and then deletes the bucket.

        $ gcloud alpha storage rm --recursive gs://my-bucket/

    The following command deletes all text files in the top-level of my-bucket,
    but not text files in subdirectories:

        $ gcloud alpha storage rm -recursive gs://my-bucket/*.txt

    The following command deletes one wildcard expression per line passed in by
    stdin:

        $ some_program | gcloud alpha storage rm -I

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [URLS ...]
        The URLs of the resources to delete.

FLAGS
     --all-versions, -a
        Delete all versions
        (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning) of an object.

     --continue-on-error
        If an error occurs, continue to perform the operation on remaining
        resources. If any operations are unsuccessful, the command will exit
        with a non-zero exit status, even if this flag is set. This option is
        implicitly set when running operations in parallel mode.

     --if-generation-match=GENERATION
        Execute only if the generation matches the generation of the requested
        object.

     --if-metageneration-match=METAGENERATION
        Execute only if the metageneration matches the metageneration of the
        requested object.

     --recursive, -R, -r
        Recursively delete the contents of buckets or directories that match
        the path expression. If the path is set to a bucket, like gs://bucket,
        the bucket is also deleted. This option implies the --all-versions
        option. If you want to delete only live object versions, use the ``**''
        wildcard instead.

     --stdin, -I
        Read the list of resources to remove from stdin.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
