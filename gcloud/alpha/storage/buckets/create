EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a Cloud Storage bucket named my-bucket:

        $ gcloud alpha storage buckets create gs://my-bucket

    The following command creates a bucket with the nearline default storage
    class (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes) in the asia
    location (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations):

        $ gcloud alpha storage buckets create gs://my-bucket \
            --default-storage-class=nearline --location=asia

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL
        The URL of the bucket to create.

FLAGS
     --default-encryption-key=DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY, -k DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY
        Set the default KMS key using the full path to the key, which has the
        following form:
        projects/[project-id]/locations/[location]/keyRings/[key-ring]/cryptoKeys/[my-key].

     --default-storage-class=DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS, -c DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS, -s DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS
        Default storage class
        (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes) for the bucket.
        If not specified, the default storage class used by Cloud Storage is
        "Standard".

     --location=LOCATION, -l LOCATION
        Location (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations) for the
        bucket. If not specified, the location used by Cloud Storage is us. A
        bucket's location cannot be changed after creation.

     --pap, --public-access-prevention
        Sets public access prevention to "enforced". For details on how exactly
        public access is blocked, see:
        http://cloud/storage/docs/public-access-prevention

     --retention-period=RETENTION_PERIOD
        Minimum retention period
        (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-lock#retention-periods)
        for objects stored in the bucket, for example
        --retention-period=1Y1M1D5S. Objects added to the bucket cannot be
        deleted until they've been stored for the specified length of time.
        Default is no retention period. Only available for Cloud Storage using
        the JSON API.

     --[no-]uniform-bucket-level-access, -b
        Turns on uniform bucket-level access setting. Default is False. Use
        --uniform-bucket-level-access to enable and
        --no-uniform-bucket-level-access to disable.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
