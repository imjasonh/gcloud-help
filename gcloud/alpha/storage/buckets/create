DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create new buckets.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates 2 Cloud Storage buckets, one named my-bucket
    and a second bucket named my-other-bucket:

        $ gcloud alpha storage buckets create gs://my-bucket \
            gs://my-other-bucket

    The following command creates a bucket with the nearline default storage
    class (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes) in the asia
    location (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations):

        $ gcloud alpha storage buckets create gs://my-bucket \
            --default-storage-class=nearline --location=asia

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL [URL ...]
        The URLs of the buckets to create.

FLAGS
     --additional-headers=HEADER=VALUE
        Includes arbitrary headers in storage API calls. Accepts a comma
        separated list of key=value pairs, e.g. header1=value1,header2=value2.
        Overrides the default storage/additional_headers property value for
        this command invocation.

     --default-encryption-key=DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY, -k DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY
        Set the default KMS key using the full path to the key, which has the
        following form:
        projects/[project-id]/locations/[location]/keyRings/[key-ring]/cryptoKeys/[my-key].

     --default-storage-class=DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS, -c DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS, -s DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS
        Default storage class
        (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes) for the bucket.
        If not specified, the default storage class used by Cloud Storage is
        "Standard".

     --enable-hierarchical-namespace
        Enable hierarchical namespace for the bucket. To use this flag, you
        must also use --uniform-bucket-level-access

     --enable-per-object-retention
        Enables each object in the bucket to have its own retention settings,
        which prevents deletion until stored for a specific length of time.

     --ip-filter-file=IP_FILTER_FILE
        Sets the IP filter for the bucket. The IP filter is a list of ip ranges
        that are allowed to access the bucket. For example, The following JSON
        document shows the IP filter configuration with mode enabled and list
        of public network sources and vpc network sources:

            {
              "mode": "Enabled",
              "publicNetworkSource": { "allowedIpCidrRanges": ["0.0.0.0/0"] },
              "vpcNetworkSources": [
                  {
                      "network": "projects/PROJECT_NAME/global/networks/NETWORK_NAME",
                      "allowedIpCidrRanges": ["0.0.0.0/0"]
                  },
              ]
            }

        For more information about supported configurations, see Cloud Storage
        bucket IP filtering configurations
        (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/create-ip-filter#ip-filtering-configurations)

     --lifecycle-file=LIFECYCLE_FILE
        Sets the lifecycle management configuration on a bucket. For example,
        The following lifecycle management configuration JSON document
        specifies that all objects in this bucket that are more than 365 days
        old are deleted automatically:

            {
              "rule":
              [
                {
                  "action": {"type": "Delete"},
                  "condition": {"age": 365}
                }
              ]
            }

     --location=LOCATION, -l LOCATION
        Location (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations) for the
        bucket. If not specified, the location used by Cloud Storage is us. A
        bucket's location cannot be changed after creation.

     --[no-]pap, --[no-]public-access-prevention
        Sets public access prevention to "enforced". For details on how exactly
        public access is blocked, see:
        http://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-access-prevention. Use
        --public-access-prevention to enable and --no-public-access-prevention
        to disable.

     --placement=[REGION,...]
        A comma-separated list of regions that form the custom dual-region
        (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#location-dr). Only
        regions within the same continent are or will ever be valid. Invalid
        location pairs (such as mixed-continent, or with unsupported regions)
        will return an error.

     --recovery-point-objective=SETTING, --rpo=SETTING
        Sets the recovery point objective
        (https://cloud.google.com/architecture/dr-scenarios-planning-guide#basics_of_dr_planning)
        of a bucket. This flag can only be used with multi-region and
        dual-region buckets. DEFAULT option is valid for multi-region and
        dual-regions buckets. ASYNC_TURBO option is only valid for dual-region
        buckets. If unspecified when the bucket is created, it defaults to
        DEFAULT for dual-region and multi-region buckets. For more information,
        see replication in Cloud Storage
        (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/availability-durability#cross-region-redundancy).
        SETTING must be one of: ASYNC_TURBO, DEFAULT.

     --retention-period=RETENTION_PERIOD
        Minimum retention period
        (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-lock#retention-periods)
        for objects stored in the bucket, for example
        --retention-period=P1Y1M1DT5S. Objects added to the bucket cannot be
        deleted until they've been stored for the specified length of time.
        Default is no retention period. Only available for Cloud Storage using
        the JSON API.

     --soft-delete-duration=SOFT_DELETE_DURATION
        Duration to retain soft-deleted objects. For example, "2w1d" is two
        weeks and one day. See gcloud topic datetimes for more information on
        the duration format. Setting 0 will disable soft delete policy on the
        bucket. Default is 7 days.

     --[no-]uniform-bucket-level-access, -b
        Turns on uniform bucket-level access setting. Default is False. Use
        --uniform-bucket-level-access to enable and
        --no-uniform-bucket-level-access to disable.

AUTOCLASS FLAGS
     --autoclass-terminal-storage-class=AUTOCLASS_TERMINAL_STORAGE_CLASS
        The storage class that objects in the bucket eventually transition to
        if they are not read for a certain length of time. Only valid if
        Autoclass is enabled.

     --[no-]enable-autoclass
        The Autoclass feature automatically selects the best storage class for
        objects based on access patterns. Use --enable-autoclass to enable and
        --no-enable-autoclass to disable.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud storage buckets create
