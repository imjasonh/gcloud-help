NAME
    gcloud alpha storage buckets relocate - relocates bucket between different
        locations

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage buckets relocate
        ([URL --location=LOCATION : --placement=[REGION,...]
          --dry-run] [--operation=OPERATION --finalize : --ttl=TTL])
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Relocates a bucket between different locations.

EXAMPLES
    To move a bucket (gs://my-bucket) to the us-central1 location, use the
    following command:

        $ gcloud alpha storage buckets relocate gs://my-bucket \
          --location=us-central1

    To move a bucket to a custom dual-region, use the following command:

        $ gcloud alpha storage buckets relocate gs://my-bucket \
          --location=us --placement=us-central1,us-east1

    To validate the operation without actually moving the bucket, use the
    following command:

        $ gcloud alpha storage buckets relocate gs://my-bucket \
          --location=us-central1 --dry-run

    To schedule a write lock for the move, with ttl for reverting the write
    lock after 7h, if the relocation has not succeeded, use the following
    command:

        $ gcloud alpha storage buckets relocate \
          --operation=projects/_/buckets/my-bucket/operations/C894F35J \
          --finalize --ttl=7h

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       Arguments for initiating the bucket relocate operation.

         URL
            The URL of the bucket to relocate.

            This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
            arguments in this group are specified.

         --location=LOCATION
            The final location
            (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations) where the bucket
            will be relocated to. If no location is provided, Cloud Storage
            will use the default location, which is us.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --placement=[REGION,...]
            A comma-separated list of regions that form the custom dual-region
            (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#location-dr). Only
            regions within the same continent are or will ever be valid.
            Invalid location pairs (such as mixed-continent, or with
            unsupported regions) will return an error.

         --dry-run
            Prints the operations that the relocate command would perform
            without actually performing relocation. This is helpful to identify
            any issues that need to be detected asynchronously.

       Arguments for advancing the relocation operation.

         --operation=OPERATION
            Specify the relocation operation name to advance the relocation
            operation.The relocation operation name must include the Cloud
            Storage bucket and operation ID.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --finalize
            Schedules the write lock to occur. Once activated, no further
            writes will be allowed to the associated bucket. This helps
            minimize disruption to bucket usage. For certain types of
            moves(between Multi Region and Custom Dual Regions), finalize is
            not required.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --ttl=TTL
            Time to live for the relocation operation. Defaults to 12h if not
            provided.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud storage buckets relocate
