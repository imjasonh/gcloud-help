    having anywhere_cache_id my-cache-id:

        $ gcloud alpha storage buckets anywhere-caches pause \
            my-bucket/my-cache-id

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ID [ID ...]

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud storage buckets anywhere-caches pause
