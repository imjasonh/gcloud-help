NAME
    gcloud alpha storage managed-folders describe - describe managed folders

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage managed-folders describe URL
        [--additional-headers=HEADER=VALUE] [--raw] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Describe managed folders.

EXAMPLES
    The following command shows information about a managed folder named folder
    in a bucket called my-bucket:

        $ gcloud alpha storage managed-folders describe \
            gs://my-bucket/folder/

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL
        The URL of the managed folder to describe.

FLAGS
     --additional-headers=HEADER=VALUE
        Includes arbitrary headers in storage API calls. Accepts a comma
        separated list of key=value pairs, e.g. header1=value1,header2=value2.
        Overrides the default storage/additional_headers property value for
        this command invocation.

     --raw
        Shows metadata in the format returned by the API instead of
        standardizing it.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
