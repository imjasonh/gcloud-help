NAME
    gcloud alpha storage managed-folders delete - delete managed folders

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage managed-folders delete URL [URL ...]
        [--additional-headers=HEADER=VALUE] [--continue-on-error, -c]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete managed folders.

EXAMPLES
    The following command deletes a managed folder named folder in a bucket
    called my-bucket:

        $ gcloud alpha storage managed-folders delete gs://my-bucket/folder/

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL [URL ...]
        The URLs of the managed folders to delete.

FLAGS
     --additional-headers=HEADER=VALUE
        Includes arbitrary headers in storage API calls. Accepts a comma
        separated list of key=value pairs, e.g. header1=value1,header2=value2.
        Overrides the default storage/additional_headers property value for
        this command invocation.

     --continue-on-error, -c
        If any operations are unsuccessful, the command will exit with a
        non-zero exit status after completing the remaining operations. This
        flag takes effect only in sequential execution mode (i.e. processor and
        thread count are set to 1). Parallelism is default.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud storage managed-folders delete
