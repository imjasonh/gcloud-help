NAME
    gcloud alpha storage managed-folders set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy
        for a managed folder

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage managed-folders set-iam-policy URLS [URLS ...]
        POLICY_FILE [--continue-on-error, -c] [--etag=ETAG, -e ETAG]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Set the IAM policy for a managed folder. For more information, see
    Cloud Identity and Access Management
    (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam).

EXAMPLES
    To set the IAM policy in POLICY-FILE on a managed folder managed-folder in
    a bucket bucket:

        $ gcloud alpha storage managed-folders set-iam-policy \
            gs://bucket/managed-folder POLICY-FILE

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URLS [URLS ...]
        URLs for managed folders to apply the IAM policy to.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

FLAGS
     --continue-on-error, -c
        If any operations are unsuccessful, the command will exit with a
        non-zero exit status after completing the remaining operations. This
        flag takes effect only in sequential execution mode (i.e. processor and
        thread count are set to 1). Parallelism is default.

     --etag=ETAG, -e ETAG
        Custom etag to set on IAM policy. API will reject etags that do not
        match this value, making it useful as a precondition during concurrent
        operations.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
