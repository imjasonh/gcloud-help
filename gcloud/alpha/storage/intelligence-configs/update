NAME
    gcloud alpha storage intelligence-configs update - updates storage
        intelligence configuration

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage intelligence-configs update
        (--organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT
          | --sub-folder=SUB_FOLDER)
        (--inherit-from-parent
          | --exclude-bucket-id-regexes=[EXCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]
          | --include-bucket-id-regexes=[INCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]
          --exclude-locations=[EXCLUDE_LOCATIONS,...]
          | --include-locations=[INCLUDE_LOCATIONS,...]) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update storage intelligence configuration for the organization,
    sub-folder or project.

EXAMPLES
    To limit buckets in the storage intelligence configuration, Use the
    following command with --include-bucket-id-regexes flag. to specify list of
    bucket ids and bucket id regexes.,

        $gcloud alpha storage intelligence-configs update --organization=my-org --include-bucket-id-regexes=my-bucket-.*

    To apply location based filters in the storage intelligence configuration,
    Use --include-locations or --exclude-locations flags to specify allowed
    list of locations or excluded list of locations. The following command
    updates storage intelligence configuration of sub-folder 123456 with the
    specified list of excluded locations.,

        $gcloud alpha storage intelligence-configs update --sub-folder=123456 --exclude-locations=us-east1,us-west1

    The following command updates storage intelligence for the given project by
    inheriting existing storage intelligence configuration from the
    hierarchical parent resource.,

        $gcloud alpha storage intelligence-configs update --project=my-project --inherit-from-parent

    To clear included locations from the project storage intelligence, Use the
    following command.,

        $gcloud alpha storage intelligence-configs update --project=my-project --include-locations=

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Specifies organization id for the storage intelligence config.

       --project=PROJECT
          Specifies project for the storage intelligence config.

       --sub-folder=SUB_FOLDER
          Specifies sub-folder id for the storage intelligence config.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --inherit-from-parent
          Specifies storage intelligence config to be inherited from parent.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --exclude-bucket-id-regexes=[EXCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]
            Sets filter for bucket id regexes to exclude. Accepts list of
            bucket id regexes in comma separated format. If the regex contains
            special characters that may have a specific meaning in the shell,
            escape them using backslashes(\). To clear bucket id regexes list,
            provide flag with an empty list. e.g --exclude-bucket-id-regexes=""
            or --exclude-bucket-id-regexes= .

         --include-bucket-id-regexes=[INCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]
            Sets filter for bucket id regexes to include. Accepts list of
            bucket id regexes in comma separated format. If the regex contains
            special characters that may have a specific meaning in the shell,
            escape them using backslashes(\). To clear bucket id regexes list,
            provide flag with empty list. e.g --include-bucket-id-regexes="" or
            --include-bucket-id-regexes= .

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --exclude-locations=[EXCLUDE_LOCATIONS,...]
            Comma separated list of locations
            (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#available-locations)
            to exclude in storage intelligence filter. To clear excluded
            locations, provide flag with empty list. e.g --exclude-locations=""
            or --exclude-locations= .

         --include-locations=[INCLUDE_LOCATIONS,...]
            Comma separated list of locations
            (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#available-locations)
            to include in storage intelligence filter. To clear included
            locations, provide flag with empty list. e.g --include-locations=""
            or --include-locations= .

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
