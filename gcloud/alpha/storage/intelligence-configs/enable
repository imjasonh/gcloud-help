        (--organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT
          | --sub-folder=SUB_FOLDER)
        [--exclude-locations=[EXCLUDE_LOCATIONS,...]
          | --include-locations=[INCLUDE_LOCATIONS,...]]
        [--exclude-bucket-id-regexes=[EXCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]
          | --include-bucket-id-regexes=[INCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Enable storage intelligence plan for the organization, sub-folder

EXAMPLES
    To remove buckets from the storage intelligence plan, Use the following
    command with --exclude-bucket-id-regexes flag. to specify list of bucket id
    regexes.,

        $gcloud alpha storage intelligence-configs enable --organization=my-org --exclude-bucket-id-regexes="my-bucket-.*"

    To apply location based filters in the storage intelligence plan, Use
    --include-locations or --exclude-locations flags to specify allowed list of
    locations or excluded list of locations. The following command updates
    storage intelligence plan of sub-folder 123456 with the specified list of
    included locations.,

        $gcloud alpha storage intelligence-configs enable --sub-folder=123456 --include-locations="us-east1","us-west1"

       --exclude-locations=[EXCLUDE_LOCATIONS,...]
          Comma separated list of locations
          (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#available-locations)

          or --exclude-locations= .

       --include-locations=[INCLUDE_LOCATIONS,...]
          Comma separated list of locations
          (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#available-locations)
          to include in storage intelligence filter. To clear included

          or --include-locations= .

BUCKET_FILTER FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --include-bucket-id-regexes=[INCLUDE_BUCKET_ID_REGEXES,...]
          Sets filter for bucket id regexes to include. Accepts list of bucket
          id regexes in comma separated format. If the regex contains special
