NAME
    gcloud alpha storage service-agent - manage a project's Cloud Storage
        service agent, which is used to perform Cloud KMS operations

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage service-agent [--authorize-cmek=AUTHORIZE_CMEK]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha storage service-agent displays the Cloud Storage
    service agent, which is used to perform Cloud KMS operations against your a
    default or supplied project. If the project does not yet have a service
    agent, gcloud alpha storage service-agent creates one.

EXAMPLES
    To show the service agent for your default project:

        $ gcloud alpha storage service-agent

    To show the service account for my-project:

        $ gcloud alpha storage service-agent --project=my-project

    To authorize your default project to use a Cloud KMS key:

        $ gcloud alpha storage service-agent \
            --authorize-cmek=projects/key-project/locations/us-east1/\
        keyRings/key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key

FLAGS
     --authorize-cmek=AUTHORIZE_CMEK
        Adds appropriate encrypt/decrypt permissions to the specified Cloud KMS
        key. This allows the Cloud Storage service agent to write and read
        Cloud KMS-encrypted objects in buckets associated with the service
        agent's project.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
