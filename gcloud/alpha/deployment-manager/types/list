NAME
    gcloud alpha deployment-manager types list - describe a type provider type

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha deployment-manager types list [--provider=PROVIDER]
        [--provider-project=PROVIDER_PROJECT] [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) By default, you will see types from your project and gcp-types. To
    see types from any single project, you can use the --provider-project flag.

EXAMPLES
    To print out a list of all available type names, run:

        $ gcloud alpha deployment-manager types list

    If you only want the types for a specific provider, you can specify which
    one using --provider

        $ gcloud alpha deployment-manager types list --provider=PROVIDER

    By default, we'll show you types from your project and gcp-types, which
    contains the default Google Cloud Platform types. If you want types for
    only one project, use the 'provider-project' flag. Specifying the provider
    without a provider-project will search both your project and gcp-types for
    that provider's types.

FLAGS
     --provider=PROVIDER
        Type provider name.

     --provider-project=PROVIDER_PROJECT
        Project id with types you want to see.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager types list

        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager types list
