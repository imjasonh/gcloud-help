NAME
    gcloud alpha deployment-manager - manage deployments of cloud resources

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha deployment-manager GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The gcloud alpha deployment-manager command group lets you manage
    the deployment of Google Cloud Platform resources using Google Cloud
    Deployment Manager.

    Google Cloud Deployment Manager allows you to specify all the resources
    needed for your application in a declarative format using YAML. You can
    also use Python or Jinja2 templates to parameterize the configuration and
    allow reuse of common deployment paradigms such as a load balanced,
    auto-scaled instance group.

    More information on Cloud Deployment Manager can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager and detailed documentation can
    be found here: https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.
