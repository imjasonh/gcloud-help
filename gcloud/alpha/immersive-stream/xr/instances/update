NAME
    gcloud alpha immersive-stream xr instances update - update an Immersive
        Stream for XR service instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha immersive-stream xr instances update
        (INSTANCE : --location=LOCATION)
        (--update-realm=[capacity=CAPACITY],[realm=REALM] | --version=VERSION)
        [--async] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an Immersive Stream for XR service instance. This command
    can either be used to update the capacity for an existing realm of the
    service instance or to update the content build version served by the
    instance. If updating the capacity, only one realm may be updated for each
    command execution, and the new capacity may not be 0 or exceed the quota
    limit.

EXAMPLES
    To update the service instance 'my-instance' to have capacity 2 for realm
    REALM_NA_WEST, run:

        $ gcloud alpha immersive-stream xr instances update my-instance \
            --update-realm=realm=REALM_NA_WEST,capacity=2

    To update the service instance 'my-instance' to serve content build version
    'my-version', run:

        $ gcloud alpha immersive-stream xr instances update my-instance \
            --version=my-version

          'realm' is the realm in which the instance is deployed, and must be
