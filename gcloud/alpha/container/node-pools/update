DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha container node-pools update updates a node pool in a
    Google Kubernetes Engine cluster.

EXAMPLES
    To turn on node autoupgrade in "node-pool-1" in the cluster
    "sample-cluster", run:

        $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
            --cluster=sample-cluster --enable-autoupgrade

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the node pool.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --accelerator=[type=TYPE,[count=COUNT,gpu-driver-version=GPU_DRIVER_VERSION,gpu-partition-size=GPU_PARTITION_SIZE,gpu-sharing-strategy=GPU_SHARING_STRATEGY,max-shared-clients-per-gpu=MAX_SHARED_CLIENTS_PER_GPU],...]
          Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to all nodes.

           type
              (Required) The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-t4 for NVIDIA T4)
              of accelerator to attach to the instances. Use gcloud compute
              accelerator-types list to learn about all available accelerator
              types.

           count
              (Optional) The number of accelerators to attach to the instances.
              The default value is 1.

           gpu-driver-version
              (Optional) The NVIDIA driver version to install.
              GPU_DRIVER_VERSION must be one of:

                  `default`: Install the default driver version for this GKE version. For GKE version 1.30.1-gke.1156000 and later, this is the default option.

                  `latest`: Install the latest driver version available for this GKE version.
                  Can only be used for nodes that use Container-Optimized OS.

                  `disabled`: Skip automatic driver installation. You must manually install a
                  driver after you create the cluster. For GKE version 1.30.1-gke.1156000 and earlier, this is the default option.
                  To manually install the GPU driver, refer to https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/gpus#installing_drivers.

           gpu-partition-size
              (Optional) The GPU partition size used when running
              multi-instance GPUs. For information about multi-instance GPUs,
              refer to:
              https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/gpus-multi

           gpu-sharing-strategy
              (Optional) The GPU sharing strategy (e.g. time-sharing) to use.
              For information about GPU sharing, refer to:
              https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/timesharing-gpus

           max-shared-clients-per-gpu
              (Optional) The max number of containers allowed to share each GPU
              on the node. This field is used together with
              gpu-sharing-strategy.

       --confidential-node-type=CONFIDENTIAL_NODE_TYPE
          Recreate all the nodes in the node pool to be confidential VM
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/confidential-vm/docs/about-cvm.
          CONFIDENTIAL_NODE_TYPE must be one of: sev, sev_snp, tdx, disabled.

       --containerd-config-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          Path of the YAML file that contains containerd configuration entries
          like configuring access to private image registries.

          For detailed information on the configuration usage, please refer to
          https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/customize-containerd-configuration.

          Note: Updating the containerd configuration of an existing cluster or
          node pool requires recreation of the existing nodes, which might
          cause disruptions in running workloads.

          Use a full or relative path to a local file containing the value of
          containerd_config.

       --enable-confidential-nodes
          Recreate all the nodes in the node pool to be confidential VM
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/confidential-vm/docs/about-cvm.

       --enable-gvnic
          Enable the use of GVNIC for this cluster. Requires re-creation of
          nodes using either a node-pool upgrade or node-pool creation.

       --enable-image-streaming
          Specifies whether to enable image streaming on node pool.

       --enable-insecure-kubelet-readonly-port
          Enables the Kubelet's insecure read only port.

          To disable the readonly port on a cluster or node-pool set the flag
          to --no-enable-insecure-kubelet-readonly-port.

       --enable-private-nodes
          Enables provisioning nodes with private IP addresses only.

          The control plane still communicates with all nodes through private
          IP addresses only, regardless of whether private nodes are enabled or
          disabled.

       --enable-queued-provisioning
          Mark the nodepool as Queued only. This means that all new nodes can
          be obtained only through queuing via ProvisioningRequest API.

              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                  --cluster=example-cluster --enable-queued-provisioning
              ... and other required parameters, for more details see:
              https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/provisioningrequest

       --flex-start
          Start the node pool with Flex Start provisioning model.

              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                   --cluster=example-cluster --flex-start
              and other required parameters, for more details see:
              https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/provisioningrequest

       --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Labels to apply to the Google Cloud resources of node pools in the
          Kubernetes Engine cluster. These are unrelated to Kubernetes labels.
          Warning: Updating this label will causes the node(s) to be recreated.

          Examples:

              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                  --cluster=example-cluster --labels=label1=value1,label2=value2

       --logging-variant=LOGGING_VARIANT
          Specifies the logging variant that will be deployed on all the nodes
          in the node pool. If the node pool doesn't specify a logging variant,
          then the logging variant specified for the cluster will be deployed
          on all the nodes in the node pool. Valid logging variants are
          MAX_THROUGHPUT, DEFAULT. LOGGING_VARIANT must be one of:

           DEFAULT
              'DEFAULT' variant requests minimal resources but may not
              guarantee high throughput.
           MAX_THROUGHPUT
              'MAX_THROUGHPUT' variant requests more node resources and is able
              to achieve logging throughput up to 10MB per sec.

       --max-run-duration=MAX_RUN_DURATION
          Limit the runtime of each node in the node pool to the specified
          duration.

              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                  --cluster=example-cluster --max-run-duration=3600s

       --network-performance-configs=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
          Configures network performance settings for the node pool. If this
          flag is not specified, the pool will be created with its default
          network performance configuration.

           total-egress-bandwidth-tier
              Total egress bandwidth is the available outbound bandwidth from a
              VM, regardless of whether the traffic is going to internal IP or
              external IP destinations. The following tier values are allowed:
              [TIER_UNSPECIFIED,TIER_1]

       --node-labels=[NODE_LABEL,...]
          Replaces all the user specified Kubernetes labels on all nodes in an
          existing node pool with the given labels.

          Examples:

              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                  --cluster=example-cluster \
                  --node-labels=label1=value1,label2=value2

          Updating the node pool's --node-labels flag applies the labels to the
          Kubernetes Node objects for existing nodes in-place; it does not
          re-create or replace nodes. New nodes, including ones created by
          resizing or re-creating nodes, will have these labels on the
          Kubernetes API Node object. The labels can be used in the
          nodeSelector field. See
          https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/
          for examples.

          Note that Kubernetes labels, intended to associate cluster components
          and resources with one another and manage resource lifecycles, are
          different from Google Kubernetes Engine labels that are used for the
          purpose of tracking billing and usage information.

       --node-locations=ZONE,[ZONE,...]
          Set of zones in which the node pool's nodes should be located.
          Changing the locations for a node pool will result in nodes being
          either created or removed from the node pool, depending on whether
          locations are being added or removed.

          Multiple locations can be specified, separated by commas. For
          example:

              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                  --cluster=sample-cluster \
                  --node-locations=us-central1-a,us-central1-b

       --node-taints=[NODE_TAINT,...]
          Replaces all the user specified Kubernetes taints on all nodes in an
          existing node pool, which can be used with tolerations for pod
          scheduling.

          Examples:

              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                  --cluster=example-cluster \
                  --node-taints=key1=val1:NoSchedule,key2=val2:PreferNoSchedule

          To read more about node-taints, see
          https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-taints.

       --resource-manager-tags=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Replaces all the user specified resource manager tags on all nodes in
          an existing node pool in a Standard cluster with the given
          comma-separated resource manager tags that has the GCE_FIREWALL
          purpose.

          Examples:

              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update example-node-pool \
                  --resource-manager-tags=tagKeys/1234=tagValues/2345
              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update example-node-pool \
                  --resource-manager-tags=my-project/key1=value1
              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update example-node-pool \
                  --resource-manager-tags=12345/key1=value1,23456/key2=value2
              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update example-node-pool \
                  --resource-manager-tags=

          All nodes, including nodes that are resized or re-created, will have
          the specified tags on the corresponding Instance object in the
          Compute Engine API. You can reference these tags in network firewall
          policy rules. For instructions, see
          https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/use-tags-for-firewalls.

       --storage-pools=STORAGE_POOL,[...]
          A list of storage pools where the node pool's boot disks will be
          provisioned. Replaces all the current storage pools of an existing
          node pool, with the specified storage pools.

          STORAGE_POOL must be in the format
          projects/project/zones/zone/storagePools/storagePool

       --system-config-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          Path of the YAML/JSON file that contains the node configuration,
          including Linux kernel parameters (sysctls) and kubelet configs.

          Examples:

              kubeletConfig:

          hugepage of 2m and 1g should not exceed 8GB * 0.6 = 4.8GB.

          1G hugepages are only available in following machine familes: c3, m2,
          c2d, c3d, h3, m3, a2, a3, g2.

          Supported values for 'cgroupMode' under 'linuxConfig'.

          ▸ CGROUP_MODE_V1: Use cgroupv1 on the node pool.
          ▸ CGROUP_MODE_V2: Use cgroupv2 on the node pool.
          ▸ CGROUP_MODE_UNSPECIFIED: Use the default GKE cgroup
            configuration.

          Supported values for 'transparentHugepageEnabled' under 'linuxConfig'
          which controls transparent hugepage support for anonymous memory.

          ▸ TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_ENABLED_ALWAYS: Transparent hugepage is
            enabled system wide.
          ▸ TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_ENABLED_MADVISE: Transparent hugepage is
            enabled inside MADV_HUGEPAGE regions. This is the default kernel
            configuration.
          ▸ TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_ENABLED_NEVER: Transparent hugepage is
            disabled.
          ▸ TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_ENABLED_UNSPECIFIED: Default value. GKE will
            not modify the kernel configuration.

          Supported values for 'transparentHugepageDefrag' under 'linuxConfig'
          which defines the transparent hugepage defrag configuration on the
          node.

          ▸ TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_DEFRAG_ALWAYS: It means that an application
            requesting THP will stall on allocation failure and directly
            reclaim pages and compact memory in an effort to allocate a THP
            immediately.
          ▸ TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_DEFRAG_DEFER: It means that an application
            will wake kswapd in the background to reclaim pages and wake
            kcompactd to compact memory so that THP is available in the near
            future. It is the responsibility of khugepaged to then install the
            THP pages later.
          ▸ TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_DEFRAG_DEFER_WITH_MADVISE: It means that an
            application will enter direct reclaim and compaction like always,
            but only for regions that have used madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE); all
            other regions will wake kswapd in the background to reclaim pages
            and wake kcompactd to compact memory so that THP is available in
            the near future.
          ▸ TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_DEFRAG_MADVISE: It means that an application
            will enter direct reclaim and compaction like always, but only for
            regions that have used madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE); all other regions
            will wake kswapd in the background to reclaim pages and wake
            kcompactd to compact memory so that THP is available in the near
            future.
          ▸ TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_DEFRAG_NEVER: It means that an application
            will never enter direct reclaim or compaction.
          ▸ TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_DEFRAG_UNSPECIFIED: Default value. GKE will
            not modify the kernel configuration.

          Note, updating the system configuration of an existing node pool
          requires recreation of the nodes which which might cause a
          disruption.

          Use a full or relative path to a local file containing the value of
          system_config.

       --tags=[TAG,...]
          Replaces all the user specified Compute Engine tags on all nodes in
          an existing node pool with the given tags (comma separated).

          Examples:

              $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                  --cluster=example-cluster --tags=tag1,tag2

          New nodes, including ones created by resize or recreate, will have
          these tags on the Compute Engine API instance object and these tags
          can be used in firewall rules. See
          https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/firewall-rules/create
          for examples.

       --windows-os-version=WINDOWS_OS_VERSION
          Specifies the Windows Server Image to use when creating a Windows
          node pool. Valid variants can be "ltsc2019", "ltsc2022". It means
          using LTSC2019 server image or LTSC2022 server image. If the node
          pool doesn't specify a Windows Server Image Os version, then Ltsc2019
          will be the default one to use. WINDOWS_OS_VERSION must be one of:
          ltsc2019, ltsc2022.

       --workload-metadata=WORKLOAD_METADATA
          Type of metadata server available to pods running in the node pool.
          WORKLOAD_METADATA must be one of:

           EXPOSED
              [DEPRECATED] Pods running in this node pool have access to the
              node's underlying Compute Engine Metadata Server.
           GCE_METADATA
              Pods running in this node pool have access to the node's
              underlying Compute Engine Metadata Server.
           GKE_METADATA
              Run the Kubernetes Engine Metadata Server on this node. The
              Kubernetes Engine Metadata Server exposes a metadata API to
              workloads that is compatible with the V1 Compute Metadata APIs
              exposed by the Compute Engine and App Engine Metadata Servers.
              This feature can only be enabled if Workload Identity is enabled
              at the cluster level.
           GKE_METADATA_SERVER
              [DEPRECATED] Run the Kubernetes Engine Metadata Server on this
              node. The Kubernetes Engine Metadata Server exposes a metadata
              API to workloads that is compatible with the V1 Compute Metadata
              APIs exposed by the Compute Engine and App Engine Metadata
              Servers. This feature can only be enabled if Workload Identity is
              enabled at the cluster level.
           SECURE
              [DEPRECATED] Prevents pods not in hostNetwork from accessing
              certain VM metadata, specifically kube-env, which contains
              Kubelet credentials, and the instance identity token. This is a
              temporary security solution available while the bootstrapping
              process for cluster nodes is being redesigned with significant
              security improvements. This feature is scheduled to be deprecated
              in the future and later removed.

       Upgrade settings

         --enable-blue-green-upgrade
            Changes node pool upgrade strategy to blue-green upgrade.

         --enable-surge-upgrade
            Changes node pool upgrade strategy to surge upgrade.

         --max-surge-upgrade=MAX_SURGE_UPGRADE
            Number of extra (surge) nodes to be created on each upgrade of the
            node pool.

            Specifies the number of extra (surge) nodes to be created during
            this node pool's upgrades. For example, running the following
            command will result in creating an extra node each time the node
            pool is upgraded:

                $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                    --cluster=example-cluster --max-surge-upgrade=1   \
                    --max-unavailable-upgrade=0

            Must be used in conjunction with '--max-unavailable-upgrade'.

         --max-unavailable-upgrade=MAX_UNAVAILABLE_UPGRADE
            Number of nodes that can be unavailable at the same time on each
            upgrade of the node pool.

            Specifies the number of nodes that can be unavailable at the same
            time during this node pool's upgrades. For example, assume the node
            pool has 5 nodes, running the following command will result in
            having 3 nodes being upgraded in parallel (1 + 2), but keeping
            always at least 3 (5 - 2) available each time the node pool is
            upgraded:

                $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                    --cluster=example-cluster --max-surge-upgrade=1   \
                    --max-unavailable-upgrade=2

         --node-pool-soak-duration=NODE_POOL_SOAK_DURATION
            Time in seconds to be spent waiting during blue-green upgrade
            before deleting the blue pool and completing the upgrade.

                $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                    --cluster=example-cluster  --node-pool-soak-duration=600s

         --standard-rollout-policy=[batch-node-count=BATCH_NODE_COUNT,batch-percent=BATCH_NODE_PERCENTAGE,batch-soak-duration=BATCH_SOAK_DURATION,...]
            Standard rollout policy options for blue-green upgrade.

            Batch sizes are specified by one of, batch-node-count or
            batch-percent. The duration between batches is specified by
            batch-soak-duration.

                $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                    --cluster=example-cluster  \
                    --standard-rollout-policy=batch-node-count=3,\
                batch-soak-duration=60s

                $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                    --cluster=example-cluster  \
                    --standard-rollout-policy=batch-percent=0.3,\
                batch-soak-duration=60s

            You can also specify custom machine types by providing a string
            with the format "custom-CPUS-RAM" where "CPUS" is the number of
            virtual CPUs and "RAM" is the amount of RAM in MiB.

            For example, to create a node pool using custom machines with 2
            vCPUs and 12 GB of RAM:

                $ gcloud alpha container node-pools update high-mem-pool \

              sizes of available zones.
            ▫ ANY - Instructs the cluster autoscaler to prioritize
              utilization of unused reservations, and reduces preemption risk
              for Spot VMs.

            LOCATION_POLICY must be one of: BALANCED, ANY.

         --max-nodes=MAX_NODES
