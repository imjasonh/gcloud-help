NAME
    gcloud alpha container node-pools delete - delete an existing node pool in
        a running cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container node-pools delete NAME [--async] [--cluster=CLUSTER]
        [--location=LOCATION | --region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha container node-pools delete deletes a node pool from a
    Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. When you delete a node pool, GKE
    drains all the nodes in the node pool. The draining process involves GKE
    deleting Pods on each node in the node pool. Each node in a node pool is
    drained by deleting Pods with an allotted graceful termination period of
    MAX_POD. MAX_POD is the maximum terminationGracePeriodSeconds set on the
    Pods scheduled to the node with a cap of one hour.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the "node-pool-1" node pool from the cluster "sample-cluster",
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha container node-pools delete node-pool-1 \
            --cluster=sample-cluster

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the node pool to delete.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --cluster=CLUSTER
        The cluster from which to delete the node pool. Overrides the default
        container/cluster property value for this command invocation.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --location=LOCATION
          Compute zone or region (e.g. us-central1-a or us-central1) for the
          cluster. Prefer using this flag over the --region or --zone flags.

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for a regional cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for a zonal cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container node-pools delete

        $ gcloud beta container node-pools delete
