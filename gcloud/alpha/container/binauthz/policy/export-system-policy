NAME
    gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export-system-policy - export the
        Binary Authorization system policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export-system-policy
        [--location=LOCATION; default="global"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) For reliability reasons, the system policy is updated one region at
    a time. Because of this precaution, the system policy can differ between
    regions during an update. Use --location to view the system policy of a
    specific region.

    If --location is not specified, an arbitrary region is used. (Specifically,
    a region in the last group of regions to receive updates. Since most
    changes are additions, this will show the minimal set of system images that
    are allowed in all regions.)

EXAMPLES
    To view the system policy:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export-system-policy

    To view the system policy in the region us-central1:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export-system-policy \
          --location=us-central1

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        The region for which to get the system policy (or "global"). LOCATION
        must be one of: global, asia-east1, asia-east2, asia-northeast1,
        asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-south1, asia-south2,
        asia-southeast1, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast1,
        australia-southeast2, europe-central2, europe-north1,
        europe-southwest1, europe-west1, europe-west12, europe-west2,
        europe-west3, europe-west4, europe-west5, europe-west6, europe-west8,
        europe-west9, me-central1, me-west1, northamerica-northeast1,
        northamerica-northeast2, southamerica-east1, southamerica-west1,
        us-central1, us-central2, us-east1, us-east4, us-east5, us-east7,

NOTES

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
