        provided, this field will resolve to the vmware_cluster_id. Otherwise,
        it must match the object name of the VMware OnPremUserCluster custom

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta container vmware clusters enroll
