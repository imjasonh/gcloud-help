SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container fleet multi-cluster-services disable [--force]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command disables the Multi-cluster Services Feature in a
    fleet.

EXAMPLES
    To disable the Multi-cluster Services Feature, run:

FLAGS
     --force

        disabling the entire feature, proceeds even if the feature is in use.
        Might result in unexpected behavior.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container fleet multi-cluster-services disable

        $ gcloud beta container fleet multi-cluster-services disable
