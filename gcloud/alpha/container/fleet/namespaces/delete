NAME
    gcloud alpha container fleet namespaces delete - delete a fleet namespace

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container fleet namespaces delete NAME [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The project specified does not exist.
      ▪ The namespace specified does not exist.
      ▪ The caller does not have permission to access the given project or
        namespace.

EXAMPLES
    To delete fleet namespace NAMESPACE in the active project:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet namespaces delete NAMESPACE

    To delete fleet namespace NAMESPACE in project PROJECT_ID:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet namespaces delete NAMESPACE \
            --project=PROJECT_ID

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the fleet namespace to be deleted.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet namespaces delete
