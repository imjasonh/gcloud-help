DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an existing Fleet Scope.

EXAMPLES
    First retrieve the ID of the scope using the command below.

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes list

    Update a scope.

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes update SCOPE_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Scope resource - fleet scope resource. The arguments in this group can be
     used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument scope on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SCOPE
          ID of the scope or fully qualified identifier for the scope.

          To set the scope attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument scope on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location name.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument scope on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ global is the only supported location.

FLAGS
     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --update-namespace-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of scope-level label KEY=VALUE pairs to update in the cluster
        namespace. If a label exists, its value is modified. Otherwise, a new
        label is' created.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes update --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-namespace-labels
          Remove all scope-level labels from the cluster namespace. If
          --update-namespace-labels is also specified then
          --clear-namespace-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes update scope_name \
                --clear-namespace-labels

          To remove all existing scope-level labels and create two new labels,
          foo and baz:

              $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes update scope_name \
                --clear-namespace-labels \
                --update-namespace-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-namespace-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of scope-level label keys to remove in the cluster namespace. If
          a label does not exist it is silently ignored. If
          --update-namespace-labels is also specified then
          --update-namespace-labels is applied first.

     Rollout Sequencing

     --default-upgrade-soaking=DEFAULT_UPGRADE_SOAKING
        Configures the default soaking duration for each upgrade propagating
        through the current scope to become "COMPLETE". Soaking begins after
        all clusters in the scope are on the target version, or after 30 days
        if all cluster upgrades are not complete. Once an upgrade state becomes
        "COMPLETE", it will automatically be propagated to the downstream
        scope. Max is 30 days.

        See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

        To configure Rollout Sequencing for a given scope, SCOPE_NAME, this
        attribute must be set. To do this while specifying a default soaking
        duration of 7 days, run:

            $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes update SCOPE_NAME \
                default-upgrade-soaking=7d

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --remove-upgrade-soaking-overrides
          Removes soaking time overrides for all upgrades propagating through
          the current scope. Consequently, all upgrades will follow the soak
          time configured by --default-upgrade-soaking until new overrides are
          configured with --add_upgrade_soaking_override and
          --upgrade_selector.

          To remove all soaking time overrides configured for SCOPE_NAME, run:

              $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes update SCOPE_NAME \
                  --remove-upgrade-soaking-overrides

       Or at least one of these can be specified:

         Upgrade soaking override.

         Defines a specific soaking time override for a particular upgrade
         propagating through the current scope that supercedes the default
         soaking duration configured by --default-upgrade-soaking.

         To set an upgrade soaking override of 12 hours for the upgrade with
         name, k8s_control_plane, and version, 1.23.1-gke.1000, run:

             $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes update SCOPE_NAME \
               --add-upgrade-soaking-override=12h \
               --upgrade-selector=name="k8s_control_plane",version="1.23.1-gke.1000"

         --add-upgrade-soaking-override=ADD_UPGRADE_SOAKING_OVERRIDE
            Overrides the soaking time for a particular upgrade name and
            version propagating through the current scope. Set soaking to 0
            days to bypass soaking and fast-forward the upgrade to the
            downstream scope.

            See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --upgrade-selector=[name=NAME],[version=VERSION]
            Name and version of the upgrade to be overridden where version is a
            full GKE version. Currently, name can be either k8s_control_plane
            or k8s_node.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --reset-upstream-scope
          Clears the relationship between the current scope and its upstream
          scope in the rollout sequence.

          To remove the link between SCOPE_NAME and its upstream scope, run:

              $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes update SCOPE_NAME \
                  --reset-upstream-scope

       --upstream-scope=UPSTREAM_SCOPE
          Full resource name of the upstream scope in the format of
          projects/{project}/locations/{location}/scopes/{scope}. GKE will
          finish upgrades on the upstream scope before applying the same
          upgrades to the current scope.

          To configure the upstream scope for SCOPE_NAME, run:

              $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes update SCOPE_NAME \
                --upstream-scope=projects/{upstream_project}/locations/global/scopes/{upstream_scope}
