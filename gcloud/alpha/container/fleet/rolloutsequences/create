        sequence resource

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container fleet rolloutsequences create ROLLOUTSEQUENCE
        --stage-config=PATH_TO_FILE [--async] [--display-name=DISPLAY_NAME]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a rollout sequence resource.

EXAMPLES
    To create a rollout sequence, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet rolloutsequences create \
            ROLLOUTSEQUENCE --stage-config=path/to/config.yaml

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RolloutSequence resource - The group of arguments defining a Rollout
     Sequence. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument rolloutSequence on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     To set the location attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument rolloutSequence on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ global is the only supported location.

     This must be specified.

       ROLLOUTSEQUENCE
          ID of the rolloutSequence or fully qualified identifier for the
          rolloutSequence.

          To set the rollout_sequence attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument rolloutSequence on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --stage-config=PATH_TO_FILE
        Path to the YAML file containing the stage configurations. The YAML
        file should contain a list of stages. Fleet projects and soak_duration
        are required. If label_selector is not specified, there is no
        filtering. A fleet project is the project where the fleet is hosted.
        Example:

            - stage:
              fleet-projects:
              # Expected format: projects/{project}
              - projects/my-dev-project
              soak-duration: 7d # Or 168h or 604800s
            - stage:
              fleet-projects:
              - projects/my-prod-project
              soak-duration: 3600s
              label-selector: resource.labels.canary=='true'
            - stage:
              fleet-projects:
              # Expected format: projects/{project}
              - projects/my-prod-project
              soak-duration: 30m

        Use a full or relative path to a local file containing the value of
        stage_config.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
        Display name of the rollout sequence to be created (optional).

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Labels for the rollout sequence.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet rolloutsequences create
