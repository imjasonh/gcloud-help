NAME
    gcloud alpha container fleet service-directory disable - disable the
        Service Directory Feature

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container fleet service-directory disable [--force]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Disables the Service Directory Feature in a fleet.

EXAMPLES
    To disable the Service Directory Feature, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet service-directory disable

FLAGS
     --force
        Bypasses any prompts for confirmation. When disabling the entire
        feature, forces disable even if the feature is in use. Force
        disablement of the entire feature may result in unexpected behavior.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
