NAME
    gcloud alpha container fleet memberships unregister - unregister a cluster
        from Fleet

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container fleet memberships unregister
        [[MEMBERSHIP_NAME] --location=LOCATION]
        (--gke-cluster=LOCATION/CLUSTER_NAME | --gke-uri=GKE_URI
          | [--context=CONTEXT : --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG])
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command unregisters a cluster with the fleet by:

        1. Deleting the Fleet Membership resource for this cluster (a.k.a
           `gcloud alpha container fleet memberships delete`).
        2. Removing the corresponding in-cluster Kubernetes Resources that make the
           cluster exclusive to one fleet (a.k.a `kubectl delete memberships
           membership`).
        3. Uninstalling the Connect Agent from this cluster (a.k.a
           `kubectl delete on the gke-connect namespace`).

    The unregister command makes additional internal checks to ensure that all
    three steps can be safely done to properly clean-up in-Fleet and in-cluster
    resources.

    To register a non-GKE cluster use --context flag (with an optional
    --kubeconfig flag).

    To register a GKE cluster use --gke-cluster or --gke-uri flag (no
    --kubeconfig flag is required).

    To only delete the Fleet Membership resource, consider using the command:
    gcloud alpha container fleet memberships delete. This command is intended
    to delete stale Fleet Membership resources as doing so on a fully
    registered cluster will skip some of the steps above and orphan in-cluster
    resources and agent connections to Google.

EXAMPLES
    Unregister a non-GKE cluster referenced from a specific kubeconfig file:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet memberships unregister \
            my-membership --context=my-cluster-context \
            --kubeconfig=/home/user/custom_kubeconfig

    Unregister a non-GKE cluster referenced from the default kubeconfig file:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet memberships unregister \
            my-membership --context=my-cluster-context

    Unregister a GKE cluster referenced from a GKE URI:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet memberships unregister \
            my-membership --gke-uri=my-cluster-gke-uri

    Unregister a GKE cluster referenced from a GKE Cluster location and name:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet memberships unregister \
            my-membership --gke-cluster=my-cluster-region-or-zone/my-cluster

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Membership resource - Membership resource name. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument MEMBERSHIP_NAME on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --membership on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       [MEMBERSHIP_NAME]
          ID of the membership or fully qualified identifier for the
          membership. To set the membership attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument MEMBERSHIP_NAME on the command line;
          ▸ provide the argument --membership on the command line.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the membership resource, e.g. us-central1. If not
          specified, defaults to global.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument MEMBERSHIP_NAME on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --membership on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property gkehub/location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Cluster identifier.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --gke-cluster=LOCATION/CLUSTER_NAME
          The location/name of the GKE cluster. The location can be a zone or a
          region for e.g us-central1-a/my-cluster.

       --gke-uri=GKE_URI
          The URI of a GKE cluster that you want to register to Hub; for
          example,
          'https://container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/clusters/my-cluster'.
          To obtain the URI, you can run 'gcloud container clusters list
          --uri'. Note that this should only be provided if the cluster being
          registered is a GKE cluster. The service will validate the provided
          URI to confirm that it maps to a valid GKE cluster."

       Non-GKE cluster identifier.

         --context=CONTEXT
            The cluster context as it appears in the kubeconfig file. You can
            get this value from the command line by running command: kubectl
            config current-context.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG
            The kubeconfig file containing an entry for the cluster. Defaults
            to $KUBECONFIG if it is set in the environment, otherwise defaults
            to $HOME/.kube/config.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container fleet memberships unregister

        $ gcloud beta container fleet memberships unregister
