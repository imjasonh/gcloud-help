    NAME column:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet memberships list

    Update a membership for a cluster:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet memberships update MEMBERSHIP_ID

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Membership resource - membership resource representing a cluster in Fleet.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument membership on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       MEMBERSHIP
          ID of the membership or fully qualified identifier for the
          membership.

          To set the membership attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument membership on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location name.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument membership on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ global is the only supported location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha container fleet memberships update --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud alpha container fleet memberships update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.
