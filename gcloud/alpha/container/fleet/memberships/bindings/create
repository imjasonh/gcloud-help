NAME
    gcloud alpha container fleet memberships bindings create - create a
        Membership Binding

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container fleet memberships bindings create
        (BINDING : --location=LOCATION --membership=MEMBERSHIP)
        (--fleet=FLEET | --scope=SCOPE) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The Membership Binding already exists.
      ▪ The caller does not have permission to access the given Membership.
      ▪ The Scope or the Membership does not exist.
      ▪ The caller did not specify the location (--location) if referring to
        location other than global.

EXAMPLES
    To create a membership binding BINDING_NAME in global membership
    MEMBERSHIP_NAME for scope SCOPE_NAME, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet memberships bindings create \
            BINDING_NAME --membership=MEMBERSHIP_NAME --scope=SCOPE_NAME

    To create a Binding BINDING_NAME associated with regional membership
    MEMBERSHIP_NAME, provide the location LOCATION_NAME for the Membership
    where the Binding belongs along with membership name and associated Scope
    SCOPE_NAME.

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet memberships bindings create \
            BINDING_NAME --membership=MEMBERSHIP_NAME --scope=SCOPE_NAME \
            --location=LOCATION_NAME
