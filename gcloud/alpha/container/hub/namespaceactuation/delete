NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub namespaceactuation delete - delete Namespace
        Actuation Feature

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub namespaceactuation delete [--force]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command deletes Namespace Actuation Feature in a fleet.
    Deleting the feature object doesn't delete the Namespace actuation as it is
    an opt-out feature, it only removes any configuration.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the Namespace Actuation Feature, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub namespaceactuation delete

FLAGS
     --force
        Force disablement. Bypasses any prompts for confirmation. When
        disabling the entire feature, proceeds even if the feature is in use.
        Might result in unexpected behavior.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
