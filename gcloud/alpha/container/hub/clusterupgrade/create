NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub clusterupgrade create - create the
        clusterupgrade feature for a fleet within a given project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub clusterupgrade create
        [--default-upgrade-soaking=DEFAULT_UPGRADE_SOAKING]
        [--upstream-fleet=UPSTREAM_FLEET]
        [--add-upgrade-soaking-override=ADD_UPGRADE_SOAKING_OVERRIDE
          --upgrade-selector=[name=NAME],[version=VERSION]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create the clusterupgrade feature for a fleet within a given
    project.

EXAMPLES
    To create the clusterupgrade feature for the current fleet, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub clusterupgrade create \
            --default-upgrade-soaking=DEFAULT_UPGRADE_SOAKING

FLAGS
     --default-upgrade-soaking=DEFAULT_UPGRADE_SOAKING
        Note: This flag only applies to Rollout Sequencing v1, not Rollout
        Sequencing v2 (which uses custom stages). If using Rollout Sequencing
        v1 and this flag is not provided, a default value of 7 days will be
        used.

        Configures the default soaking duration for each upgrade propagating
        through the current fleet to become "COMPLETE". Soaking begins after
        all clusters in the fleet are on the target version, or after 30 days
        if all cluster upgrades are not complete. Once an upgrade state becomes
        "COMPLETE", it will automatically be propagated to the downstream
        fleet. Max is 30 days.

        To configure Rollout Sequencing for a fleet, this attribute must be
        set. To do this while specifying a default soaking duration of 7 days,
        run:

            $ gcloud alpha container hub clusterupgrade create \
                --default-upgrade-soaking=7d

     --upstream-fleet=UPSTREAM_FLEET
        The upstream fleet. GKE will finish upgrades on the upstream fleet
        before applying the same upgrades to the current fleet.

        To configure the upstream fleet, run:

            $ gcloud alpha container hub clusterupgrade create             \
                --upstream-fleet={upstream_fleet}

     Upgrade soaking override.

     Defines a specific soaking time override for a particular upgrade
     propagating through the current fleet that supercedes the default soaking
     duration configured by --default-upgrade-soaking.

     To set an upgrade soaking override of 12 hours for the upgrade with name,
     k8s_control_plane, and version, 1.23.1-gke.1000, run:

         $ gcloud alpha container hub clusterupgrade create               \
             --add-upgrade-soaking-override=12h               \
             --upgrade-selector=name="k8s_control_plane",\
         version="1.23.1-gke.1000"

     --add-upgrade-soaking-override=ADD_UPGRADE_SOAKING_OVERRIDE
        Overrides the soaking time for a particular upgrade name and version
        propagating through the current fleet. Set soaking to 0 days to bypass
        soaking and fast-forward the upgrade to the downstream fleet.

        See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

        This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
        this group are specified.

     --upgrade-selector=[name=NAME],[version=VERSION]
        Name and version of the upgrade to be overridden where version is a
        full GKE version. Currently, name can be either k8s_control_plane or
        k8s_node.

        This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
        this group are specified.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container hub clusterupgrade create

        $ gcloud beta container hub clusterupgrade create
