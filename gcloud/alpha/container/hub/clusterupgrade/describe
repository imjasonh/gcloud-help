NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub clusterupgrade describe - describe the
        clusterupgrade feature for a fleet within a given project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub clusterupgrade describe
        [--show-linked-cluster-upgrade] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Describe the Fleet clusterupgrade feature used for configuring
    fleet-based rollout sequencing.

EXAMPLES
    To view the cluster upgrade feature information for the current fleet, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub clusterupgrade describe

FLAGS
     --show-linked-cluster-upgrade
        Shows the cluster upgrade feature information for the current fleet as
        well as information for all other fleets linked in the same rollout
        sequence (provided that the caller has permission to view the upstream
        and downstream fleets). This displays cluster upgrade information for
        fleets in the current fleet's rollout sequence in order of furthest
        upstream to downstream.

        To view the cluster upgrade feature information for the rollout
        sequence containing the current fleet, run:

            $ gcloud alpha container hub clusterupgrade describe \
                --show-linked-cluster-upgrade

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
