        configuration properties from Policy Controller components

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub policycontroller deployment remove DEPLOYMENT
        PROPERTY [VALUE] [--effect=EFFECT]
        [--all-memberships
          | [--memberships=[MEMBERSHIPS,...] : --location=LOCATION]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Remove customizations of on-cluster components in Policy
    Controller. These components are managed as individual kubernetes
    deployments (e.g. 'admission') in the gatekeeper-system namespace.

    When removing a 'toleration' property, it must match exactly, including the
    key, value and effect flag (if originally specified).

EXAMPLES
    To remove the replica count for a component:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub policycontroller deployment remove \
            admission replica-count

    To remove the replica count for a component across all fleet memberships:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub policycontroller deployment remove \
            admission replica-count --all-memberships

    To remove a toleration with key 'my-key' on a component:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub policycontroller deployment remove \
            admission toleration my-key

    To remove a toleration with key 'my-key' and 'my-value' on a component:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub policycontroller deployment remove \
            admission toleration my-key=my-value

    To remove a toleration with key 'my-key' and 'my-value' on a component,
    along with the effect 'NoSchedule':

        $ gcloud alpha container hub policycontroller deployment remove \
            admission toleration my-key=my-value --effect=NoSchedule

    To remove a memory limit:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub policycontroller deployment remove \
            audit memory-limit

    To remove a memory request:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub policycontroller deployment remove \
            mutation memory-request

    To remove a cpu limit:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub policycontroller deployment remove \
            admission cpu-limit

    To remove a cpu request:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub policycontroller deployment remove \
            audit cpu-request

    To remove the anti-affinity configuration:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub policycontroller deployment remove \

       Membership resource - The group of arguments defining one or more
       memberships. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
       attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
       arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

       To set the project attribute:
        ▸ provide the argument --memberships on the command line with a fully
          specified name;
        ▸ provide the argument --project on the command line;
        ▸ set the property core/project.

         --memberships=[MEMBERSHIPS,...]
            IDs of the memberships or fully qualified identifiers for the
            memberships.

            To set the memberships attribute:
            ▫ provide the argument --memberships on the command line.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --location=LOCATION
            Location for the memberships.

            To set the location attribute:
            ▫ provide the argument --memberships on the command line with a
              fully specified name;
            ▫ provide the argument --location on the command line;
            ▫ set the property gkehub/location.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,

    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container hub policycontroller deployment remove

        $ gcloud beta container hub policycontroller deployment remove
