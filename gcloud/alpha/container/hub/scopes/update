          --remove-upgrade-soaking-overrides

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an existing Fleet Scope.

EXAMPLES
    First retrieve the ID of the scope using the command below.

        $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes list

    Update a scope.

        $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes update SCOPE_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Scope resource - fleet scope resource. The arguments in this group can be
     used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument scope on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       SCOPE
          ID of the scope or fully qualified identifier for the scope.

          To set the scope attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument scope on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location name.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument scope on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ global is the only supported location.

FLAGS
     Rollout Sequencing

       --default-upgrade-soaking=DEFAULT_UPGRADE_SOAKING
          Configures the default soaking duration for each upgrade propagating
          through the current scope to become "COMPLETE". Soaking begins after
          all clusters in the scope are on the target version, or after 30 days
          if all cluster upgrades are not complete. Once an upgrade state
          becomes "COMPLETE", it will automatically be propagated to the
          downstream scope. Max is 30 days.

          See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

          To configure Rollout Sequencing for a given scope, SCOPE_NAME, this
          attribute must be set. To do this while specifying a default soaking
          duration of 7 days, run:

              $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes update SCOPE_NAME \
                  default-upgrade-soaking=7d

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --remove-upgrade-soaking-overrides
            Removes soaking time overrides for all upgrades propagating through
            the current scope. Consequently, all upgrades will follow the soak
            time configured by --default-upgrade-soaking until new overrides
            are configured with --add_upgrade_soaking_override and
            --upgrade_selector.

            To remove all soaking time overrides configured for SCOPE_NAME,
            run:

                $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes update SCOPE_NAME \
                    --remove-upgrade-soaking-overrides

         Upgrade soaking override.

         Defines a specific soaking time override for a particular upgrade
         propagating through the current scope that supercedes the default
         soaking duration configured by --default-upgrade-soaking.

         To set an upgrade soaking override of 12 hours for the upgrade with
         name, k8s_control_plane, and version, 1.23.1-gke.1000, run:

             $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes update SCOPE_NAME \
               --add-upgrade-soaking-override=12h \
               --upgrade-selector=name="k8s_control_plane",version="1.23.1-gke.1000"

           --add-upgrade-soaking-override=ADD_UPGRADE_SOAKING_OVERRIDE
              Overrides the soaking time for a particular upgrade name and
              version propagating through the current scope. Set soaking to 0
              days to bypass soaking and fast-forward the upgrade to the
              downstream scope.

              See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

              This flag argument must be specified if any of the other
              arguments in this group are specified.

           --upgrade-selector=[UPGRADE_SELECTOR,...]
              Name and version of the upgrade to be overridden where version is
              a full GKE version. Currently, name can be either
              k8s_control_plane or k8s_node.

              This flag argument must be specified if any of the other
              arguments in this group are specified.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --reset-upstream-scope
            Clears the relationship between the current scope and its upstream
            scope in the rollout sequence.

            To remove the link between SCOPE_NAME and its upstream scope, run:

                $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes update SCOPE_NAME \
                    --reset-upstream-scope

         --upstream-scope=UPSTREAM_SCOPE
            Full resource name of the upstream scope in the format of
            projects/{project}/locations/{location}/scopes/{scope}. GKE will
            finish upgrades on the upstream scope before applying the same
            upgrades to the current scope.

            To configure the upstream scope for SCOPE_NAME, run:

                $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes update SCOPE_NAME \
                  --upstream-scope=projects/{upstream_project}/locations/global/scopes/{upstream_scope}

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the gkehub/v1alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at:

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
