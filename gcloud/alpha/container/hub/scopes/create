DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a Fleet Scope resource.

EXAMPLES
    Create a new scope SCOPE_NAME in the active project's fleet:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes create SCOPE_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Scope resource - The fleet scope resourse to be created. This represents a
     Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument scope on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     To set the location attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument scope on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ global is the only supported location.

     This must be specified.

       SCOPE
          ID of the scope or fully qualified identifier for the scope.

          To set the scope attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument scope on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --namespace-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of scope-level label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

     Rollout Sequencing

     These flags are not compatible with the --async flag.

       --default-upgrade-soaking=DEFAULT_UPGRADE_SOAKING
          Configures the default soaking duration for each upgrade propagating
          through the current scope to become "COMPLETE". Soaking begins after
          all clusters in the scope are on the target version, or after 30 days
          if all cluster upgrades are not complete. Once an upgrade state
          becomes "COMPLETE", it will automatically be propagated to the
          downstream scope. Max is 30 days.

          See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

          To configure Rollout Sequencing for a given scope, SCOPE_NAME, this
          attribute must be set. To do this while specifying a default soaking
          duration of 7 days, run:

              $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes create SCOPE_NAME \
                  default-upgrade-soaking=7d

       --upstream-scope=UPSTREAM_SCOPE
          Full resource name of the upstream scope in the format of
          projects/{project}/locations/{location}/scopes/{scope}. GKE will
          finish upgrades on the upstream scope before applying the same
          upgrades to the current scope.

          To configure the upstream scope for SCOPE_NAME, run:

              $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes create SCOPE_NAME \
                --upstream-scope=projects/{upstream_project}/locations/global/scopes/{upstream_scope}

       Upgrade soaking override.

       Defines a specific soaking time override for a particular upgrade
       propagating through the current scope that supercedes the default
       soaking duration configured by --default-upgrade-soaking.

       To set an upgrade soaking override of 12 hours for the upgrade with
       name, k8s_control_plane, and version, 1.23.1-gke.1000, run:

           $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes create SCOPE_NAME \
             --add-upgrade-soaking-override=12h \
             --upgrade-selector=name="k8s_control_plane",version="1.23.1-gke.1000"

         --add-upgrade-soaking-override=ADD_UPGRADE_SOAKING_OVERRIDE
            Overrides the soaking time for a particular upgrade name and
            version propagating through the current scope. Set soaking to 0
            days to bypass soaking and fast-forward the upgrade to the
            downstream scope.

            See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --upgrade-selector=[name=NAME],[version=VERSION]
            Name and version of the upgrade to be overridden where version is a
            full GKE version. Currently, name can be either k8s_control_plane
            or k8s_node.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the gkehub/v1alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/connect/registering-a-cluster

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container hub scopes create

        $ gcloud beta container hub scopes create
