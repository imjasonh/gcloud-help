NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub scopes add-app-operator-binding - add
        project-level and fleet scope-level IAM bindings and create a fleet
        scope RBAC role binding for an app operator principal

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub scopes add-app-operator-binding SCOPE
        --role=ROLE (--group=GROUP | --user=USER) [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) One binding consists of an app operator principal (user/group) and
    a role (view/edit/admin).

    This command sets up the different permissions required for an app
    operator, including usage of fleet scopes, connect gateway, logging, and
    metrics. The authoritative list for adding the permissions is the existing
    RBAC role bindings under the specified scope.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The scope specified does not exist.
      ▪ The user does not have access to the specified scope.
      ▪ The principal specified already has another binding for the scope.

EXAMPLES
    The following command:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes add-app-operator-binding SCOPE \
            --role=view --group=people@google.com --project=PROJECT_ID

      ▪ adds IAM policy binding: roles/gkehub.scopeViewer on SCOPE
      ▪ adds IAM policy binding: roles/gkehub.scopeViewerProjectLevel on
        PROJECT_ID
      ▪ adds IAM policy binding: roles/logging.viewAccessor on PROJECT_ID
        with condition where bucket corresponds to SCOPE
      ▪ creates fleet scope RBAC role binding: role view with a random ID for
        group people@google.com.

    ---

    The following command:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes add-app-operator-binding SCOPE \
            --role=edit --user=person@google.com --project=PROJECT_ID

      ▪ adds IAM policy binding: roles/gkehub.scopeEditor on SCOPE
      ▪ adds IAM policy binding: roles/gkehub.scopeEditorProjectLevel on
        PROJECT_ID
      ▪ adds IAM policy binding: roles/logging.viewAccessor on PROJECT_ID
        with condition where bucket corresponds to SCOPE
      ▪ creates fleet scope RBAC role binding: role edit with a random ID for
        user person@google.com.

    ---

    The following command:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub scopes add-app-operator-binding SCOPE \
            --role=admin --user=person@google.com --project=PROJECT_ID

      ▪ adds IAM policy binding: roles/gkehub.scopeAdmin on SCOPE
      ▪ adds IAM policy binding: roles/gkehub.scopeEditorProjectLevel on
        PROJECT_ID
      ▪ adds IAM policy binding: roles/logging.viewAccessor on PROJECT_ID
        with condition where bucket corresponds to SCOPE
      ▪ creates fleet scope RBAC role binding: role admin with a random ID
        for user person@google.com.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Scope resource - The group of arguments defining the Fleet Scope. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument SCOPE on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     To set the location attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument SCOPE on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ global is the only supported location.

     This must be specified.

       SCOPE
          ID of the scope or fully qualified identifier for the scope.

          To set the scope attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument SCOPE on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --role=ROLE
        Role to assign. ROLE must be one of: admin, edit, view.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --group=GROUP
          Group for the role binding.

       --user=USER
          User for the role binding.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta container hub scopes add-app-operator-binding
