NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships get-credentials - fetch credentials
        for a Fleet-registered cluster to be used in Connect Gateway

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships get-credentials MEMBERSHIP
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha container hub memberships get-credentials updates the
    kubeconfig file with the appropriate credentials and endpoint information
    to send kubectl commands to a Fleet-registered and connected cluster
    through Connect Gateway Service.

    It takes a project, passed through by set defaults or flags. By default,
    credentials are written to $HOME/.kube/config. You can provide an alternate
    path by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable. If KUBECONFIG contains
    multiple paths, the first one is used.

    Upon success, this command will switch current context to the target
    cluster, when working with multiple clusters.

EXAMPLES
    Get gateway kubeconfig for a registered cluster:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships get-credentials my-cluster

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this

    access allowlist. These variants are also available:
