NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships bindings update - update the Binding
        in a Membership

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships bindings update
        (BINDING : --location=LOCATION --membership=MEMBERSHIP) --scope=SCOPE
        [--update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--clear-labels | --remove-labels=[KEY,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The Membership specified does not exist.
      ▪ The Binding does not exist in the Membership.
      ▪ The caller does not have permission to access the Membership/Binding.
      ▪ The Scope specified does not exist.
      ▪ The caller did not specify the location (--location) if referring to
        location other than global.

EXAMPLES
    To update the binding BINDING_NAME in global membership MEMBERSHIP_NAME in
    the active project:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships bindings update \
            BINDING_NAME --membership=MEMBERSHIP_NAME

    To update a Binding BINDING_NAME associated with regional membership
    MEMBERSHIP_NAME, provide the location LOCATION_NAME for the Membership
    where the Binding belongs along with membership name and associated Scope
    SCOPE_NAME.

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships bindings update \
            BINDING_NAME --membership=MEMBERSHIP_NAME --scope=SCOPE_NAME \
            --location=LOCATION_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Binding resource - The group of arguments defining a Membership Binding.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument BINDING on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       BINDING
          ID of the binding or fully qualified identifier for the binding.

          To set the binding attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument BINDING on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location for the binding.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument BINDING on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property gkehub/location.

       --membership=MEMBERSHIP
          Name of the binding.

          To set the membership attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument BINDING on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --membership on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --scope=SCOPE
        ID of the scope or fully qualified identifier for the scope.

        To set the scope attribute:
        ◆ provide the argument --scope on the command line.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships bindings update \
                --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships bindings update \
                --clear-labels --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta container hub memberships bindings update
