NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships register - register a cluster with a
        fleet

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships register
        [[MEMBERSHIP_NAME] --location=LOCATION]
        (--gke-cluster=LOCATION/CLUSTER_NAME | --gke-uri=GKE_URI
          | [--context=CONTEXT : --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG])
        (--service-account-key-file=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE
          | [--enable-workload-identity : --has-private-issuer
          | --public-issuer-url=PUBLIC_ISSUER_URL]) [--internal-ip]
        [--manifest-output-file=MANIFEST_OUTPUT_FILE] [--proxy=PROXY]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command registers a cluster with the fleet by:

        1. Creating a Fleet Membership resource corresponding to the cluster.
        2. Adding in-cluster Kubernetes Resources that make the cluster exclusive
           to one fleet.
        3. Installing the Connect Agent into this cluster.

    A successful registration implies that the cluster is now exclusive to a
    single fleet.

    For more information about Connect Agent, go to:
    https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/connect/overview/

    To register a non-GKE or GKE On-Prem cluster use --context flag (with an
    optional --kubeconfig flag).

    To register a GKE cluster use --gke-cluster or --gke-uri flag (no
    --kubeconfig flag is required).

    In all cases, the Connect Agent that is installed in the target cluster
    must authenticate to Google using a --service-account-key-file that
    corresponds to a service account that has been granted gkehub.connect
    permissions.

    If the cluster is already registered to another fleet, the registration is
    not successful.

    Rerunning this command against the same cluster with the same
    MEMBERSHIP_NAME and target fleet is successful and upgrades the Connect
    Agent if a new agent is available.

EXAMPLES
    Register a non-GKE or GKE On-Prem cluster referenced from a specific
    kubeconfig file, and install the Connect Agent:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships register my-cluster \
            --context=my-cluster-context \
            --kubeconfig=/home/user/custom_kubeconfig \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

    Register a non-GKE or GKE On-Prem cluster referenced from the default
    kubeconfig file, and install the Connect Agent:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships register my-cluster \
            --context=my-cluster-context \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

    Register a non-GKE or GKE On-Prem cluster, and install a specific version
    of the Connect Agent:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships register my-cluster \
            --context=my-cluster-context \
            --version=gkeconnect_20190802_02_00 \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

    Register a non-GKE or GKE On-Prem cluster and output a manifest that can be
    used to install the Connect Agent:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships register my-cluster \
            --context=my-cluster-context \
            --manifest-output-file=/tmp/manifest.yaml \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

    Register a GKE cluster referenced from a GKE URI, and install the Connect
    Agent:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships register my-cluster \
            --gke-uri=my-cluster-gke-uri \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

    Register a GKE cluster referenced from a GKE Cluster location and name, and
    install the Connect Agent:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships register my-cluster \
            --gke-cluster=my-cluster-region-or-zone/my-cluster \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

    Register a GKE cluster, and install a specific version of the Connect
    Agent:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships register my-cluster \
            --gke-uri=my-cluster-gke-uri \
            --version=gkeconnect_20190802_02_00 \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships register my-cluster \
            --gke-cluster=my-cluster-region-or-zone/my-cluster \
            --version=gkeconnect_20190802_02_00 \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

    Register a GKE cluster and output a manifest that can be used to install
    the Connect Agent:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships register my-cluster \
            --gke-uri=my-cluster-gke-uri \
            --manifest-output-file=/tmp/manifest.yaml \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships register my-cluster \
            --gke-cluster=my-cluster-region-or-zone/my-cluster \
            --manifest-output-file=/tmp/manifest.yaml \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Membership resource - Membership resource name. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument MEMBERSHIP_NAME on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --membership on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       [MEMBERSHIP_NAME]
          ID of the membership or fully qualified identifier for the
          membership. To set the membership attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument MEMBERSHIP_NAME on the command line;
          ▸ provide the argument --membership on the command line.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location for the membership resource, e.g. us-central1. If not
          specified, defaults to global. Not supported for GKE clusters, whose
          membership location will be the location of the cluster.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument MEMBERSHIP_NAME on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --membership on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property gkehub/location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Cluster identifier.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --gke-cluster=LOCATION/CLUSTER_NAME
          The location/name of the GKE cluster. The location can be a zone or a
          region for e.g us-central1-a/my-cluster.

       --gke-uri=GKE_URI
          The URI of a GKE cluster that you want to register to Hub; for
          example,
          'https://container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/clusters/my-cluster'.
          To obtain the URI, you can run 'gcloud container clusters list
          --uri'. Note that this should only be provided if the cluster being
          registered is a GKE cluster. The service will validate the provided
          URI to confirm that it maps to a valid GKE cluster."

       Non-GKE cluster identifier.

         --context=CONTEXT
            The cluster context as it appears in the kubeconfig file. You can
            get this value from the command line by running command: kubectl
            config current-context.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG
            The kubeconfig file containing an entry for the cluster. Defaults
            to $KUBECONFIG if it is set in the environment, otherwise defaults
            to $HOME/.kube/config.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --service-account-key-file=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE
          The JSON file of a Google Cloud service account private key. This
          service account key is stored as a secret named creds-gcp in
          gke-connect namespace. To update the creds-gcp secret in gke-connect
          namespace with a new service account key file, run the following
          command:

          kubectl delete secret creds-gcp -n gke-connect

          kubectl create secret generic creds-gcp -n gke-connect
          --from-file=creds-gcp.json=/path/to/file

       Workload Identity

         --enable-workload-identity
            Enable Workload Identity when registering the cluster with a fleet.
            Ensure that GKE Workload Identity is enabled on your GKE cluster,
            it is a requirement for using Workload Identity with memberships.
            Refer to the Registering a cluster using Workload Identity section
            in
            https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/connect/registering-a-cluster#register_cluster
            --service_account_key_file flag should not be set if this is set.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --has-private-issuer
              Set to true for clusters where no publicly-routable OIDC
              discovery endpoint for the Kubernetes service account token
              issuer exists.

              When set to true, the gcloud command-line tool will read the
              private issuer URL and JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) (public keys) for
              validating service account tokens from the cluster's API server
              and upload both when creating the Membership. Google Cloud
              Platform will then use the JWKS, instead of a public OIDC
              endpoint, to validate service account tokens issued by this
              cluster. Note the JWKS establishes the uniqueness of issuers in
              this configuration, but issuer claims in tokens are still
              compared to the issuer URL associated with the Membership when
              validating tokens.

              Note the cluster's OIDC discovery endpoints (KUBE-API-ADDRESS
              (https://)/.well-known/openid-configuration and KUBE-API-ADDRESS
              (https://)/openid/v1/jwks) must still be network-accessible to
              the gcloud client running this command.

           --public-issuer-url=PUBLIC_ISSUER_URL
              Skip auto-discovery and register the cluster with this issuer
              URL. Use this option when the OpenID Provider Configuration and
              associated JSON Web Key Set for validating the cluster's service
              account JWTs are served at a public endpoint different from the
              cluster API server. Requires --enable-workload-identity.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --internal-ip
        Whether to use the internal IP address of the cluster endpoint.

     --manifest-output-file=MANIFEST_OUTPUT_FILE
        The full path of the file into which the Connect Agent installation
        manifest should be stored. If this option is provided, then the
        manifest will be written to this file and will not be deployed into the
        cluster by gcloud, and it will need to be deployed manually.

     --proxy=PROXY
        The proxy address in the format of http[s]://{hostname}. The proxy must
        support the HTTP CONNECT method in order for this connection to
        succeed.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container hub memberships register

        $ gcloud beta container hub memberships register
