NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub delete - delete a fleet

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub delete [--async] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The project specified does not exist.
      ▪ The project specified already has a fleet.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access the given
        project.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a fleet in project example-foo-bar-1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub delete --project=example-foo-bar-1

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container hub delete

        $ gcloud beta container hub delete
