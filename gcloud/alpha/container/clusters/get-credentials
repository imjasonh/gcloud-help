NAME
    gcloud alpha container clusters get-credentials - fetch credentials for a
        running cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container clusters get-credentials NAME [--internal-ip]
        [--location=LOCATION | --region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha container clusters get-credentials updates a
    kubeconfig file with appropriate credentials and endpoint information to
    point kubectl at a specific cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine.

    It takes a project and a zone as parameters, passed through by set defaults
    or flags. By default, credentials are written to HOME/.kube/config. You can
    provide an alternate path by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable.
    If KUBECONFIG contains multiple paths, the first one is used.

    This command enables switching to a specific cluster, when working with
    multiple clusters. It can also be used to access a previously created
    cluster from a new workstation.

    By default, gcloud alpha container clusters get-credentials will configure
    kubectl to automatically refresh its credentials using the same identity as
    gcloud. If you are running kubectl as part of an application, it is
    recommended to use application default credentials
    (https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production). To configure a
    kubeconfig file to use application default credentials, set the
    container/use_application_default_credentials Cloud SDK property
    (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/properties) to true before running
    gcloud alpha container clusters get-credentials

    See https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/kubectl for kubectl
    documentation.

EXAMPLES
    To switch to working on your cluster 'sample-cluster', run:

        $ gcloud alpha container clusters get-credentials sample-cluster \
            --location=us-central1-f

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the cluster to get credentials for. Overrides the default
        container/cluster property value for this command invocation.

FLAGS
     --internal-ip
        Whether to use the internal IP address of the cluster endpoint.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --location=LOCATION
          Compute zone or region (e.g. us-central1-a or us-central1) for the
          cluster.

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container clusters get-credentials

        $ gcloud beta container clusters get-credentials
