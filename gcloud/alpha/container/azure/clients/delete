            --location=us-west1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Client resource - Azure client to delete. The arguments in this group can
     be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument client on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CLIENT
          ID of the client or fully qualified identifier for the client. To set
          the client attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument client on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location for the client. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument client on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property container_azure/location.

FLAGS
     --allow-missing
        Allow idempotent deletion of cluster. The request will still succeed in
        case the cluster does not exist.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud container azure clients delete
