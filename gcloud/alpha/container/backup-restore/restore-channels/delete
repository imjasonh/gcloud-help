DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a Backup for GKE restore channel.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a restore channel my-restore-channel in project my-project in
    location us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container backup-restore restore-channels delete \
            my-restore-channel --project=my-project --location=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Restore channel resource - Name of the restore channel to delete. The name
     may be provided either as a relative name, e.g.
     projects/<project>/locations/<location>/restoreChannels/<restoreChannel>
     or as a single ID name (with the parent resources provided via options or
     through properties), e.g. RESTORE_CHANNEL --project=<project>
     --location=<location>. The arguments in this group can be used to specify
     the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument restore_channel on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       RESTORE_CHANNEL
          ID of the restore channel or fully qualified identifier for the
          restore channel.

          To set the restore_channel attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument restore_channel on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument restore_channel on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property gkebackup/location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --etag=ETAG
        The etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        prevent simultaneous updates or deletes of a resource from overwriting
        each other.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
