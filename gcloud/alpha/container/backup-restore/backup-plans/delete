DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a Backup for GKE backup plan.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a backup plan my-backup-plan in project my-project in location
    us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container backup-restore backup-plans delete \
            my-backup-plan --project=my-project --location=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup plan resource - Name of the backup plan to delete. The name may be
     provided either as a relative name, e.g.
     projects/<project>/locations/<location>/backupPlans/<backupPlan> or as a
     single ID name (with the parent resources provided via options or through
     properties), e.g. BACKUP_PLAN --project=<project> --location=<location>.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument backup_plan on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP_PLAN
          ID of the backup plan or fully qualified identifier for the backup
          plan. To set the backup_plan attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup_plan on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup_plan on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property gkebackup/location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --etag=ETAG
        The etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        prevent simultaneous updates or deletes of a resource from overwriting
        each other.
