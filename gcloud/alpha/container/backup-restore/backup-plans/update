DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a Backup for GKE backup plan.

EXAMPLES
    To update a backup plan my-backup-plan in project my-project in location
    us-central1 to add new description, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container backup-restore backup-plans update \
            my-backup-plan --project=my-project --location=us-central1 \
            --description="New description"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup plan resource - Name of the backup plan to update. The name may be
     provided either as a relative name, e.g.
     projects/<project>/locations/<location>/backupPlans/<backupPlan> or as a
     single ID name (with the parent resources provided via options or through
     properties), e.g. BACKUP_PLAN --project=<project> --location=<location>.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument backup_plan on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP_PLAN
          ID of the backup plan or fully qualified identifier for the backup
          plan.

          To set the backup_plan attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup_plan on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup_plan on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property gkebackup/location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --deactivated
        If set, no further changes may be made to this backup plan and no
        further backups may be created for this plan. Backup deletion is still
        allowed.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Optional text description for the backup plan.

     --etag=ETAG
        The etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        prevent simultaneous updates or deletes of a resource from overwriting
        each other.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --all-namespaces
          Scope of the backup includes resources from all namespaces. Mutually
          exclusive with --selected-namespaces and --selected-applications.

       --selected-applications=SELECTED_APPLICATIONS
          List of ProtectedApplication instances whose resources are included
          in the backup. Mutually exclusive with --all-namespaces and
          --selected-namespaces. e.g:
          --selected-applications=namespace1/foo,namespace2/bar

       --selected-namespaces=[SELECTED_NAMESPACES,...]
          List of namespaces whose resources are included in the backup.
          Mutually exclusive with --all-namespaces and --selected-applications.
          e.g: --selected-namespaces=foo,bar

     --backup-delete-lock-days=BACKUP_DELETE_LOCK_DAYS
        Number of days a backup produced via this plan cannot be deleted.

        Must be less than or equal to 90 days. If 0, delete operations are
        allowed.

     --backup-retain-days=BACKUP_RETAIN_DAYS
        Number of days after which a backup produced via this plan is
        automatically deleted.

        Must be less than or equal to 365 days. If not set (value is 0),
        backups are not automatically deleted. If set, must be greater than the
        value for backup_delete_lock_days.

     --locked
        If set, subsequent updates are not allowed to the backup plan's
        retention policy and this value cannot be changed.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha container backup-restore backup-plans update \
                --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud alpha container backup-restore backup-plans update \
                --clear-labels --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.

     --encryption-key=ENCRYPTION_KEY
        Encryption key used for encrypting the backup.

        At this time, only the Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) is
        supported. Value must be entered as a relative name, e.g.:
        projects/<project>/locations/<location>/keyRings/<key-ring>/cryptoKeys/<key>.

     --include-secrets
        If true, secret resources are included in the backup if they fall
        within the scope. If unset, the default is false.

     --include-volume-data
        If true, snapshots are created for PD volumes corresponding to
        PersistentVolumeClaims that fall within the scope. If unset, the
        default is false.

     --paused
        If set, automatic backup creation is suppressed. When unset, automatic
        backup creation resumes with the next scheduled create event.

     --cron-schedule=CRON_SCHEDULE
        Schedule on which backups will be automatically created.

        Use standard cron (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) syntax.
        For example, 10 3 * * * will automatically create a backup at 0310
        every day. All times are interpreted as UTC. The minimum interval
        between scheduled backups is 10 minutes.

     --exclusion-windows-file=EXCLUSION_WINDOWS_FILE
        If provided, defines an array of exclusion windows for RPO based
        schedules from the given config file in yaml. Only used together with
        --target-rpo-minutes for creation and rpo-based plans during update.

     --target-rpo-minutes=TARGET_RPO_MINUTES
        Schedule backups based on target RPO minutes instead of fixed cron
        schedules. Cannot be used with --cron-schedule.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the gkebackup/v1 API. The full documentation for this API
    can be found at:

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta container backup-restore backup-plans update
