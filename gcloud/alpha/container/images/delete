NAME
    gcloud alpha container images delete - delete existing images

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container images delete IMAGE_NAME [IMAGE_NAME ...]
        [--force-delete-tags] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The container images delete command deletes the specified image
    from the registry. All associated tags are also deleted.

EXAMPLES
    Deletes the image as long as there aren't additional, unspecified tags
    referencing it:

        $ gcloud alpha container images delete <IMAGE_NAME>

    Deletes the image (and tags) from the input IMAGE_NAME:

        $ gcloud alpha container images delete <IMAGE_NAME> \
            --force-delete-tags

    Deletes the image (and tags) from the input IMAGE_NAME, without additional
    prompting:

        $ gcloud alpha container images delete <IMAGE_NAME> \
            --force-delete-tags --quiet

    To easily identify and delete untagged images in a project, first filter
    digests that lack tags:

        $ gcloud container images list-tags \
            [HOSTNAME]/[PROJECT-ID]/[IMAGE]              \
            --filter='-tags:*'  --format="get(digest)" --limit=$BIG_NUMBER

    Then, delete these tagless images without prompting by running:

        $ gcloud alpha container images delete \
            [HOSTNAME]/[PROJECT-ID]/[IMAGE]@DIGEST --quiet

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_NAME [IMAGE_NAME ...]
        The fully qualified name(s) of image(s) to delete. The name(s) should
        be formatted as *.gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/IMAGE_PATH@sha256:DIGEST or
        *.gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/IMAGE_PATH:TAG.

FLAGS
     --force-delete-tags
        If there are tags pointing to an image to be deleted then they must all
        be specified explicitly, or this flag must be specified, for the
        command to succeed.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container images delete

        $ gcloud beta container images delete
