EXAMPLES
    To retrieve a single health source and print its properties, run the

            <HEALTH_SOURCE_NAME> --region=<REGION>

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Health source resource - Name of the health source you want to inspect.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument health_source on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       HEALTH_SOURCE
          ID of the health source or fully qualified identifier for the health
          source.

          To set the health_source attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument health_source on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Google Compute Engine region.

          To set the region attribute:

            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/region.
