POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Health source resource - Name of the health source you want to delete. The

        specified name;

     This must be specified.

          ▸ provide the argument health_source on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

          The name of the Google Compute Engine region.

          To set the region attribute:

            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/region.
