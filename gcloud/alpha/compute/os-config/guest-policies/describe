NAME
    gcloud alpha compute os-config guest-policies describe - describe the
        specified guest policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute os-config guest-policies describe POLICY_ID
        [--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

EXAMPLES
    To describe the guest policy policy1 in the current project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute os-config guest-policies describe policy1

    To describe the guest policy policy1 in the organization 12345, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute os-config guest-policies describe policy1 \
        --organization=12345

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     POLICY_ID
        Name of the guest policy to describe.

FLAGS
     The scope of the guest policy. If a scope is not specified, the current
     project is used as the default.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The folder of the guest policy to describe.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The organization of the guest policy to describe.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The project name to use. If a project name is not specified, then the
          current project is used. The current project can be listed using
          gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can be set using
          gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles. It
          specifies the project of the resource to operate on, and also
          specifies the project for API enablement check, quota, and billing.
          To specify a different project for quota and billing, use
          --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute os-config guest-policies describe
