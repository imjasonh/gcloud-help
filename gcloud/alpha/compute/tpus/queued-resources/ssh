DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Send SSH commands to a Cloud TPU Queued Resource.

EXAMPLES
    To run an SSH command in a Cloud TPU Queued Resource's first node and first
    worker (for example, to print the time since last boot), run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute tpus queued-resources ssh my-qr \
          --command="last boot"

    To run the same command in all nodes and workers in a Cloud TPU Queued
    Resource (with the default batch size), run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute tpus queued-resources ssh my-qr \
          --command="last boot" --worker=all --node=all

    To run the same command in all nodes and workers in a Cloud TPU Queued
    Resource but batching the request in groups of 4, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute tpus queued-resources ssh my-qr \
          --command="last boot" --worker=all --node=all --batch-size=4

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [USER@]QR
        Specifies the Cloud TPU Queued Resource to send SSH command to.

        USER specifies the username with which to SSH. If omitted, the user
        login name is used.

        QR specifies the name of the Cloud TPU Queued Resource to send SSH
        command to.

     [-- SSH_ARGS ...]
        Flags and positionals passed to the underlying ssh implementation.

        The '--' argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
        left and SSH_ARGS on the right. Example:

            $ gcloud alpha compute tpus queued-resources ssh example-instance \
            --zone=us-central1-a -- -vvv -L 80:%TPU%:80

FLAGS
     --batch-size=BATCH_SIZE; default=64
        Batch size for simultaneous command execution on the client's side.
        When using a comma-separated list (e.g. '1,4,6') or a range (e.g.
        '1-3') or ``all`` keyword in --worker flag, it executes the command
        concurrently in groups of the batch size. This flag takes a value
        greater than 0 to specify the batch size to control the concurrent
        connections that can be established with the TPU workers, or the
        special keyword ``all`` to allow the concurrent command executions on
        all the specified workers in --worker flag. Maximum value of this flag
        should not be more than the number of specified workers, otherwise the
        value will be treated as ``--batch-size=all``.

     --dry-run
        Print the equivalent scp/ssh command that would be run to stdout,
        instead of executing it.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled, the gcloud command-line tool will regenerate and overwrite
        the files associated with a broken SSH key without asking for
        confirmation in both interactive and non-interactive environments.

        If disabled, the files associated with a broken SSH key will not be
        regenerated and will fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environments.

     --node=NODE; default="0"
        TPU node(s) to connect to. The supported value is a single 0-based
        index of the node(s) in the case of a TPU Pod. When also using the
        --command flag, it additionally supports a comma-separated list (e.g.
        '1,4,6'), range (e.g. '1-3'), or special keyword ``all" to run the
        command concurrently on each of the specified node(s).

        Note that when targeting multiple nodes, you should run 'ssh-add' with
        your private key prior to executing the gcloud command. Default:
        'ssh-add ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine'.

     --plain
        Suppress the automatic addition of ssh(1)/scp(1) flags. This flag is
        useful if you want to take care of authentication yourself or use
        specific ssh/scp features.

     --ssh-flag=SSH_FLAG
        Additional flags to be passed to ssh(1). It is recommended that flags
        be passed using an assignment operator and quotes. Example:

            $ gcloud alpha compute tpus queued-resources ssh example-instance \
                --zone=us-central1-a --ssh-flag="-vvv" \
                --ssh-flag="-L 80:localhost:80"

        This flag will replace occurences of %USER% and %TPU% with their
        dereferenced values. For example, passing ``80:%TPU%:80`` into the flag
        is equivalent to passing 80:162.222.181.197:80 to ssh(1) if the
        external IP address of 'example-instance' is 162.222.181.197.

        If connecting to the instance's external IP, then %TPU% is replaced
        with that, otherwise it is replaced with the internal IP.

     --ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

     --strict-host-key-checking=STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING
        Override the default behavior of StrictHostKeyChecking for the
        connection. By default, StrictHostKeyChecking is set to 'no' the first
        time you connect to an instance, and will be set to 'yes' for all
        subsequent connections. STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING must be one of: yes,
        no, ask.

     --worker=WORKER; default="0"
        TPU worker to connect to. The supported value is a single 0-based index
        of the worker in the case of a TPU Pod. When also using the --command
        flag, it additionally supports a comma-separated list (e.g. '1,4,6'),
        range (e.g. '1-3'), or special keyword ``all" to run the command
        concurrently on each of the specified workers.

        Note that when targeting multiple workers, you should run 'ssh-add'
        with your private key prior to executing the gcloud command. Default:
        'ssh-add ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine'.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the tpu to ssh. If not specified and the compute/zone property
        isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode
        only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     These arguments are used to run commands using SSH.

       --command=COMMAND
          Command to run on the Cloud TPU VM.

          Runs the command on the target Cloud TPU Queued Resource's nodes and
          then exits.

          Note: in the case of a TPU Pod, it will only run the command in the
          workers specified with the --worker flag (defaults to worker all if
          not set).

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --output-directory=OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
          Path to the directory to output the logs of the commands.

          The path can be relative or absolute. The directory must already
          exist.

          If not specified, standard output will be used.

          The logs will be written in files named {WORKER_ID}.log. For example:
          "2.log".

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --internal-ip
          Connect to TPU VMs using their internal IP addresses rather than
          their external IP addresses. Use this to connect from a Google
          Compute Engine VM to a TPU VM on the same VPC network, or between two
          peered VPC networks.

       --tunnel-through-iap
          Tunnel the SSH connection through Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy for TCP
          forwarding.

          This flag must be specified to attempt to connect via IAP tunneling.
          If it is not set, and connection to a Cloud TPU VM without external
          IP address is attempted from outside the network, then the command
          will fail.

          To use IAP tunneling, there must be firewall access to the SSH port
          for the IAP TCP IP address range for the network the TPU is created
          in. See the user guide
          (https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding) for more
          details.

          To learn more, see the IAP for TCP forwarding documentation
          (https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/tcp-forwarding-overview).

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --ssh-key-expiration=SSH_KEY_EXPIRATION
          The time when the ssh key will be valid until, such as
          "2017-08-29T18:52:51.142Z." This is only valid if the instance is not
          using OS Login. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
          formats.

       --ssh-key-expire-after=SSH_KEY_EXPIRE_AFTER
          The maximum length of time an SSH key is valid for once created and
          installed, e.g. 2m for 2 minutes. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on duration formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
