DESCRIPTION

            --zone=us-central1-b --project=my-project

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Queued resource resource - The Queued Resource you want to delete. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument queued_resource on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       QUEUED_RESOURCE
          ID of the queued_resource or fully qualified identifier for the
          queued_resource.

          To set the queued_resource attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument queued_resource on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --zone=ZONE
          The compute/zone of the Cloud TPU.

          If not specified, will use default compute/zone.

          To set the zone attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument queued_resource on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --zone on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/zone.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --force
        If set to true, any nodes in this queued resource will also be deleted.
        Otherwise, the request will only work if the queued resource has no
        nodes.
