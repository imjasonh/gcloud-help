DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) SCP into a Cloud TPU VM.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC [[[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC ...]
        Specifies the files to copy.

     [[USER@]INSTANCE:]DEST
        Specifies a destination for the source files.

FLAGS
     --compress
        Enable compression.

     --dry-run
        Print the equivalent scp/ssh command that would be run to stdout,
        instead of executing it.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled, the gcloud command-line tool will regenerate and overwrite
        the files associated with a broken SSH key without asking for
        confirmation in both interactive and non-interactive environments.

        If disabled, the files associated with a broken SSH key will not be
        regenerated and will fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environments.

     --internal-ip
        Connect to TPU VMs using their internal IP addresses rather than their
        external IP addresses. Use this to connect from a Google Compute Engine
        VM to a TPU VM on the same VPC network, or between two peered VPC
        networks.

     --plain
        Suppress the automatic addition of ssh(1)/scp(1) flags. This flag is
        useful if you want to take care of authentication yourself or use
        specific ssh/scp features.

     --recurse
        Upload directories recursively.

     --scp-flag=SCP_FLAG
        Additional flags to be passed to scp(1). This flag may be repeated.

     --ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

     --strict-host-key-checking=STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING
        Override the default behavior of StrictHostKeyChecking for the
        connection. By default, StrictHostKeyChecking is set to 'no' the first
        time you connect to an instance, and will be set to 'yes' for all
        subsequent connections. STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING must be one of: yes,
        no, ask.

     --worker=WORKER; default="0"
        TPU worker to connect to. The supported value is a single 0-based index
        of the worker in the case of a TPU Pod. When also using the --command
        flag, it additionally supports a comma-separated list (e.g. '1,4,6'),
        range (e.g. '1-3'), or special keyword ``all" to run the command
        concurrently on each of the specified workers.

        Note that when targeting multiple workers, you should run 'ssh-add'
        with your private key prior to executing the gcloud command. Default:
        'ssh-add ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine'.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the tpu to scp. If not specified and the compute/zone property
        isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode
        only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --ssh-key-expiration=SSH_KEY_EXPIRATION
          The time when the ssh key will be valid until, such as
          "2017-08-29T18:52:51.142Z." This is only valid if the instance is not
          using OS Login. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
          formats.

       --ssh-key-expire-after=SSH_KEY_EXPIRE_AFTER
          The maximum length of time an SSH key is valid for once created and
          installed, e.g. 2m for 2 minutes. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on duration formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
