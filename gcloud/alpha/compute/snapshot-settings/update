NAME
    gcloud alpha compute snapshot-settings update - update snapshot settings

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute snapshot-settings update [--async]
        [--storage-location-names=[STORAGE_LOCATION_NAMES,...]]
        [--storage-location-policy=STORAGE_LOCATION_POLICY]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update the snapshot settings of a project.

EXAMPLES
    To update the snapshot settings and set the storage location policy to the
    nearest multi-region as the source disk, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute snapshot-settings update \
            --storage-location-policy=nearest-multi-region

    To update the snapshot settings and set the storage location policy to the
    same region as the source disk, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute snapshot-settings update \
            --storage-location-policy=local-region

    To update the snapshot settings and set the storage location policy to
    store snapshots in a specific location like us-west1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute snapshot-settings update \
            --storage-location-policy=specific-locations \
            --storage-location-names=us-west1

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --storage-location-names=[STORAGE_LOCATION_NAMES,...]
        The custom storage locations that you specify for the project's
        snapshots. Use this flag only when you use the SPECIFIC_LOCATIONS value
        for the --storage-location-policy flag. For more information, refer to
        the snapshot settings documentation at
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/snapshot-settings.

     --storage-location-policy=STORAGE_LOCATION_POLICY
        The storage location policy. For more information, refer to the
        snapshot settings documentation at
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/snapshot-settings.
        STORAGE_LOCATION_POLICY must be one of: local-region,
        nearest-multi-region, specific-locations.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
