NAME
    gcloud alpha compute snapshot-settings update - update snapshot settings

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute snapshot-settings update
        [--add-access-locations=[ADD_ACCESS_LOCATIONS,...]] [--async]
        [--region=REGION]
        [--remove-access-locations=[REMOVE_ACCESS_LOCATIONS,...]]
        [--storage-location-names=[STORAGE_LOCATION_NAMES,...]]
        [--storage-location-policy=STORAGE_LOCATION_POLICY]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update the snapshot settings of a project.

EXAMPLES
    To update the snapshot settings and set the storage location policy to the
    nearest multi-region as the source disk, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute snapshot-settings update \
        --storage-location-policy=nearest-multi-region

    To update the snapshot settings and set the storage location policy to the
    same region as the source disk, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute snapshot-settings update \
        --storage-location-policy=local-region

    To update the snapshot settings and set the storage location policy to
    store snapshots in a specific location like us-west1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute snapshot-settings update \
        --storage-location-policy=specific-locations \
        --storage-location-names=us-west1

FLAGS
     --add-access-locations=[ADD_ACCESS_LOCATIONS,...]
        Access locations to add to snapshot settings

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --region=REGION
        region for regional snapshot settings

     --remove-access-locations=[REMOVE_ACCESS_LOCATIONS,...]
        Access locations to remove from snapshot settings

     --storage-location-names=[STORAGE_LOCATION_NAMES,...]
        The custom storage location that you specify for the project's
        snapshots. You can specify only a single location. Use this flag only
        when you use the specific-locations value for the
        --storage-location-policy flag. For more information, refer to the
        snapshot settings documentation at
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/snapshot-settings.

     --storage-location-policy=STORAGE_LOCATION_POLICY
        The storage location policy. For more information, refer to the
        snapshot settings documentation at
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/snapshot-settings.
        STORAGE_LOCATION_POLICY must be one of: local-region,
        nearest-multi-region, specific-locations.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the compute/alpha or compute/beta or compute/v1 API. The
    full documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute snapshot-settings update

        $ gcloud beta compute snapshot-settings update
