NAME
    gcloud alpha compute network-attachments update - update a Google Compute
        Engine network attachment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute network-attachments update NAME
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--producer-accept-list=[ACCEPT_LIST,...]]
        [--producer-reject-list=[REJECT_LIST,...]] [--region=REGION]
        [--subnets=SUBNETS,[SUBNETS,...]] [--subnets-region=SUBNETS_REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute network-attachments update is used to update
    network attachments. A service consumer creates a network attachment to
    make a network available to producers. Service producers use Private
    Service Connect Interfaces to privately connect to the network attachment.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network attachment to update.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the network attachment.

     --producer-accept-list=[ACCEPT_LIST,...]
        Projects that are allowed to connect to this network attachment.

     --producer-reject-list=[REJECT_LIST,...]
        Projects that are not allowed to connect to this network attachment.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the network attachment to update. If not specified, you might
        be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --subnets=SUBNETS,[SUBNETS,...]
        The subnetworks provided by the consumer for the producers

     --subnets-region=SUBNETS_REGION
        Region of the subnetworks to operate on. Overrides the default
        compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
