NAME
    gcloud alpha compute network-attachments delete - delete one or more Google
        Compute Engine network attachments

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute network-attachments delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete one or more Google Compute Engine network attachments.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a network attachment, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute network-attachments delete \
          NETWORK_ATTACHMENT_NAME --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the network attachments to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the network attachments to delete. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute network-attachments delete

        $ gcloud beta compute network-attachments delete
