    gcloud alpha compute composite-health-checks create - create a composite
        health check

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute composite-health-checks create
        (COMPOSITE_HEALTH_CHECK : --region=REGION)
        --health-destination=HEALTH_DESTINATION
        --health-sources=[HEALTH_SOURCES,...] [--async]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a composite health check.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a new composite health check:

        $ gcloud alpha compute composite-health-checks create \
            <COMPOSITE_HEALTH_CHECK_NAME> --region=<REGION> \
            --health-sources=my-hs --health-destination=my-fr

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Composite health check resource - The name of the composite health check
     you want to create. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument composite_health_check on the command line with
        a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       COMPOSITE_HEALTH_CHECK
          ID of the composite health check or fully qualified identifier for
          the composite health check.

          To set the composite_health_check attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument composite_health_check on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Google Compute Engine region.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument composite_health_check on the command line
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/region.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --health-destination=HEALTH_DESTINATION
        URL to the destination resource. Must be set. Must be a ForwardingRule.
        The ForwardingRule must have load balancing scheme INTERNAL or
        INTERNAL_MANAGED and must be regional and in the same region as the
        CompositeHealthCheck (cross-region deployment for INTERNAL_MANAGED is
        not supported). Can be mutated.

     --health-sources=[HEALTH_SOURCES,...]
        URLs to the HealthSource resources whose results are AND'ed. I.e. the
        aggregated result is HEALTHY only if all sources are HEALTHY. Must have
        at least 1. Must not have more than 10. Must be regional and in the
        same region as the CompositeHealthCheck. Can be mutated.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A textual description of this resource.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the compute/alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/compute/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:
