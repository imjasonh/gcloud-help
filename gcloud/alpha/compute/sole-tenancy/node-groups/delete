NAME
    gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-groups delete - delete a Compute
        Engine node group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-groups delete NAME [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a Compute Engine node group.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a node group, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-groups delete my-node-group

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the node group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the node group to operate on. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute sole-tenancy node-groups delete

        $ gcloud beta compute sole-tenancy node-groups delete
