        Engine sole-tenancy node templates

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-templates COMMAND
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Node templates are used to create the nodes in node groups. Nodes

    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute sole-tenancy node-templates

        $ gcloud beta compute sole-tenancy node-templates
