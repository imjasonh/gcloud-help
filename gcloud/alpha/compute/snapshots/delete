NAME
    gcloud alpha compute snapshots delete - delete Compute Engine snapshots

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute snapshots delete SNAPSHOT_NAME [SNAPSHOT_NAME ...]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete Compute Engine snapshots.

EXAMPLES
    To delete Compute Engine snapshots with the names 'snapshot-1' and
    'snapshot-2', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute snapshots delete snapshot-1 snapshot-2

    To list all snapshots that were created before a specific date, use the
    --filter flag with the gcloud alpha compute snapshots list command.

        $ gcloud alpha compute snapshots list \
            --filter="creationTimestamp<'2017-01-01'"

    For more information on how to use --filter with the list command, run $
    gcloud topic filters.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SNAPSHOT_NAME [SNAPSHOT_NAME ...]
        Names of the snapshots to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the snapshots are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the snapshots to delete. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute snapshots delete

        $ gcloud beta compute snapshots delete
