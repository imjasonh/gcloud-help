NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-http-proxies update - update a target HTTP
        proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-http-proxies update NAME --url-map=URL_MAP
        [--clear-http-keep-alive-timeout-sec
          | --http-keep-alive-timeout-sec=HTTP_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_SEC]
        [--global | --region=REGION]
        [--global-url-map | --url-map-region=URL_MAP_REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-http-proxies update is used to change
    the URL map of existing target HTTP proxies. A target HTTP proxy is
    referenced by one or more forwarding rules which specify the network
    traffic that the proxy is responsible for routing. The target HTTP proxy
    points to a URL map that defines the rules for routing the requests. The
    URL map's job is to map URLs to backend services which handle the actual
    requests.

EXAMPLES
    If there is an already-created URL map with the name URL_MAP, update a
    global target HTTP proxy pointing to this map by running:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-http-proxies update PROXY_NAME \
            --url-map=URL_MAP

    Update a regional target HTTP proxy by running:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-http-proxies update PROXY_NAME \
            --url-map=URL_MAP --region=REGION_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target HTTP proxy to update.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --url-map=URL_MAP
        A reference to a URL map resource. A URL map defines the mapping of
        URLs to backend services. Before you can refer to a URL map, you must
        create the URL map. To delete a URL map that a target proxy is
        referring to, you must first delete the target HTTP proxy.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-http-keep-alive-timeout-sec
          Clears previously configured http keep alive timeout sec

       --http-keep-alive-timeout-sec=HTTP_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_SEC
          Specifies how long to keep a connection open, after completing a
          response, while there is no matching traffic (in seconds). If an HTTP
          keep-alive is not specified, a default value (610 seconds) will be
          used. For Global external HTTP(S) load balancer, the minimum allowed
          value is 5 seconds and the maximum allowed value is 1200 seconds.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the target HTTP proxy is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the target HTTP proxy to update. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global-url-map
          If set, the URL map is global.

       --url-map-region=URL_MAP_REGION
          Region of the URL map to operate on. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute target-http-proxies update

        $ gcloud beta compute target-http-proxies update
