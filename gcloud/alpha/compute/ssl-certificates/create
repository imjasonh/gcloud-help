NAME
    gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates create - create a Compute Engine SSL
        certificate

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates create NAME
        (--domains=DOMAIN,[DOMAIN,...]
          | --certificate=LOCAL_FILE_PATH --private-key=LOCAL_FILE_PATH)
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--global | --region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates create creates SSL
    certificate resources, which you can use in a target HTTPS or target SSL
    proxy. An SSL certificate resource consists of a certificate and private
    key. The private key is encrypted before it is stored.

    You can create either a managed or a self-managed SslCertificate resource.
    A managed SslCertificate is provisioned and renewed for you. A self-managed
    certificate is created by passing the certificate obtained from Certificate
    Authority through --certificate and --private-key flags.

EXAMPLES
    To create a self-managed certificate resource 'my-cert' from a certificate
    placed under path 'foo/cert' and a private key placed under path 'foo/pk',
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates create my-cert \
          --certificate=foo/cert --private-key=foo/pk

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the SSL certificate to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Flags for managed or self-managed certificate.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --domains=DOMAIN,[DOMAIN,...]
          List of domains to create a managed certificate for.

       Or at least one of these can be specified:

         Flags for self-managed certificate

         --certificate=LOCAL_FILE_PATH
            Path to a local certificate file to create a self-managed
            certificate. The certificate must be in PEM format. The certificate
            chain must be no greater than 5 certs long. The chain must include
            at least one intermediate cert.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --private-key=LOCAL_FILE_PATH
            Path to a local private key file. The private key must be in PEM
            format and must use RSA or ECDSA encryption.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the SSL certificate.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the SSL certificate is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the SSL certificate to create. If not specified, you might
          be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute ssl-certificates create

        $ gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates create
