NAME
    gcloud alpha compute queued-resources delete - delete Compute Engine queued
        resources

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute queued-resources delete NAME [NAME ...] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute queued-resources delete deletes one or more
    Compute Engine queued resources.

EXAMPLES
    To delete Compute Engine queued resources with the names
    'queued-resource-1' and 'queued-resource-2', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute queued-resources delete queued-resource-1 \
            queued-resource-2

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the queued resources to delete.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the queued resources to delete. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
