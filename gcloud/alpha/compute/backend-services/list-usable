NAME
    gcloud alpha compute backend-services list-usable - list usable backend
        services

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute backend-services list-usable [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute backend-services list-usable retrieves the
    list of backend service resources in the specified project for which you
    have compute.backendService.get and compute.backendService.use permissions.
    This command is useful when you're creating load balancers in a Shared VPC
    environment and you want to use cross-project service referencing
    (https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https#cross-project). You can
    use this command to find out which backend services in other projects are
    available to you for referencing.

EXAMPLES
    To list all global backend services in a project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute backend-services list-usable --global

    To list all backend services in a region, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute backend-services list-usable --region=REGION

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME]
        Name of the backend service to operate on.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the backend service is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the backend service to operate on. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute backend-services list-usable

        $ gcloud beta compute backend-services list-usable
