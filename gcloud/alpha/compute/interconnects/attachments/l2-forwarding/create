DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments l2-forwarding create
    is used to create a L2 forwarding interconnect attachments. An interconnect
    attachment is what binds the underlying connectivity of an interconnect to
    a path into and out of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interconnect=INTERCONNECT
        The interconnect for the interconnect attachment

     --network=NETWORK
        The Google Network to use for L2 forwarding.

     --tunnel-endpoint-ip-address=TUNNEL_ENDPOINT_IP_ADDRESS
        A single IPv4 or IPv6 address. This address will be used as the source
        IP address for L2 forwarding packets sent to the appliances, and must
        be used as the destination IP address for packets that should be sent
        out through this attachment.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --bandwidth=BANDWIDTH
        Provisioned capacity of the attachment. BANDWIDTH must be one of:

         50m
            50 Mbit/s
         100m
            100 Mbit/s
         200m
            200 Mbit/s
         300m
            300 Mbit/s
         400m
            400 Mbit/s
         500m
            500 Mbit/s
         1g
            1 Gbit/s
         2g
            2 Gbit/s
         5g
            5 Gbit/s
         10g
            10 Gbit/s
         20g
            20 Gbit/s
         50g
            50 Gbit/s
         100g
            100 Gbit/s

     --default-appliance-ip-address=DEFAULT_APPLIANCE_IP_ADDRESS
        A single IPv4 or IPv6 address used as the default destination IP when
        there is no VLAN mapping result found for L2 forwarding. Unset field
        indicates the unmatched packet should be dropped.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --dry-run
        If supplied, validates the attachment without creating it.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. If not provided
        on creation, defaults to enabled. When this is enabled, the attachment
        is operational and will carry traffic. Use --no-enable-admin to disable
        it.

     --geneve-vni=GENEVE_HEADER
        A VNI identier for Geneve header, as defined in
        https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8926, used for L2 forwarding.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        passing through this interconnect attachment. Must be one of 1440,
        1460, 1500, or 8896. If not specified, the value will default to 1440.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to create. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
