        - remove vlan to ip mapping rule to an L2-forwarding attachment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments l2-forwarding remove-mapping
        NAME --vlan-key=VLAN_KEY [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments l2-forwarding
    remove-mapping remove vlan to ip mapping rule to an L2-forwarding
    attachment.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --vlan-key=VLAN_KEY
        Desired VLAN key for L2 forwarding mapping for the attachment. If not
        supplied, all mappings will be displayed.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to create. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects attachments l2-forwarding \
            remove-mapping

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments l2-forwarding \
            remove-mapping
