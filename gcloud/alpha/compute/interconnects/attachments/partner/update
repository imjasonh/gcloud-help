DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments partner update is
    used to update partner interconnect attachments. A partner interconnect
    attachment binds the underlying connectivity of a provider's Interconnect
    to a path into and out of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to patch.

FLAGS
     --candidate-cloud-router-ipv6-address=CANDIDATE_CLOUD_ROUTER_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Single IPv6 address + prefix length to be configured on the cloud
        router interface for this interconnect attachment. Example:
        2fff:eec0:3201:0:0:0:0:1/125

     --candidate-customer-router-ipv6-address=CANDIDATE_CUSTOMER_ROUTER_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Single IPv6 address + prefix length to be configured on the customer
        router interface for this interconnect attachment. Example:
        2fff:eec0:3201:0:0:0:0:2/125

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. When this is
        enabled, the attachment is operational and will carry traffic. Use
        --no-enable-admin to disable it.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        passing through this interconnect attachment. Must be one of 1440,
        1460, 1500, or 8896. If not specified, the value will default to 1440.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to patch. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        Stack type of the protocol(s) enabled on this interconnect attachment.
        STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            Both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are enabled on this attachment.
         IPV4_ONLY
            Only IPv4 protocol is enabled on this attachment.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments partner update \
                --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments partner update \
                --clear-labels --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments partner update
