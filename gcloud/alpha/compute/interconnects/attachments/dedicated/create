DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments dedicated create is
    used to create a dedicated interconnect attachments. An interconnect
    attachment is what binds the underlying connectivity of an interconnect to
    a path into and out of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interconnect=INTERCONNECT
        The interconnect for the interconnect attachment

     --router=ROUTER
        The Google Cloud Router to use for dynamic routing.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --bandwidth=BANDWIDTH
        Provisioned capacity of the attachment. BANDWIDTH must be one of:

         50m
            50 Mbit/s
         100m
            100 Mbit/s
         200m
            200 Mbit/s
         300m
            300 Mbit/s
         400m
            400 Mbit/s
         500m
            500 Mbit/s
         1g
            1 Gbit/s
         2g
            2 Gbit/s
         5g
            5 Gbit/s
         10g
            10 Gbit/s
         20g
            20 Gbit/s
         50g
            50 Gbit/s

     --candidate-ipv6-subnets=[IPV6_SUBNET,...]
        Up to 16 candidate prefixes that control the allocation of
        cloudRouterIpv6Address and customerRouterIpv6Address for this
        attachment. Each prefix must be in the Global Unique Address (GUA)
        space. It is highly recommended that it be in a range owned by the
        requestor. A GUA in a range owned by Google will cause the request to
        fail. Google will select an available prefix from the supplied
        candidates or fail the request. If not supplied, a /125 from a
        Google-owned GUA block will be selected.

     --candidate-subnets=[SUBNET,...]
        Up to 16 candidate prefixes that can be used to restrict the allocation
        of cloudRouterIpAddress and customerRouterIpAddress for this
        attachment. All prefixes must be within link-local address space.
        Google will attempt to select an unused /29 from the supplied candidate
        subnet(s), or all of link-local space if no subnets supplied. Google
        will not re-use a /29 already in-use by your project, even if it's
        contained in one of the candidate subnets. The request will fail if all
        /29s within the candidate subnets are in use at Google's edge.

     --cloud-router-ipv6-interface-id=INTERFACE_ID
        If supplied, the interface id (index within the subnet) to be used for
        the Cloud Router address. The id must be in the range of 1 to 6. If a
        subnet mask is supplied, it must be /125, and the subnet should either
        be 0 or match the selected subnet.

     --customer-router-ipv6-interface-id=PEER_INTERFACE_ID
        If supplied, the interface id (index within the subnet) to be used for
        the Cloud Router address. The id must be in the range of 1 to 6. If a
        subnet mask is supplied, it must be /125, and the subnet should either
        be 0 or match the selected subnet.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --dry-run
        If supplied, validates the attachment without creating it.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. If not provided
        on creation, defaults to enabled. When this is enabled, the attachment
        is operational and will carry traffic. Use --no-enable-admin to disable
        it.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        passing through this interconnect attachment. Only 1440 and 1500 are
        allowed values. If not specified, the value will default to 1440.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to create. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        The stack type of the protocol(s) enabled on this interconnect
        attachment. STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            Both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are enabled on this attachment.
         IPV4_ONLY
            Only IPv4 protocol is enabled on this attachment.

     --vlan=VLAN
        Desired VLAN for this attachment, in the range 2-4094. If not supplied,
        Google will automatically select a VLAN.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments dedicated create
