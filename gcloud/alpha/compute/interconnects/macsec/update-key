NAME
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects macsec update-key - update pre-shared
        key in a Compute Engine interconnect MACsec configuration

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects macsec update-key NAME
        --key-name=KEY_NAME [--start-time=START_TIME] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects macsec update-key is used to
    update a pre-shared key in MACsec configuration of interconnect.

    For an example, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To update a pre-shared key in MACsec configuration, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects macsec update-key \
            example-interconnect --key-name=default-key \
            --start-time=2021-02-01T12:12:12Z

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect to update.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --key-name=KEY_NAME
        A name of pre-shared key being added to MACsec configuration of the
        interconnect. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
        RFC1035.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --start-time=START_TIME
        A RFC3339 timestamp on or after which the key is valid. startTime can
        be in the future. If the keychain has a single key, --start-time can be
        omitted. If the keychain has multiple keys, --start-time is mandatory
        for each key. The start times of two consecutive keys must be at least
        6 hours apart.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects macsec update-key

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects macsec update-key
