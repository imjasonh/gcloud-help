NAME
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects application-awareness
        configure-bandwidth-percentage-policy - configure bandwidth percentage
        policy for application awareness configuration of a Compute Engine
        interconnect

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects application-awareness
        configure-bandwidth-percentage-policy NAME
        --bandwidth-percentages=[TC1=TC1],
          [TC2=TC2],[TC3=TC3],[TC4=TC4],[TC5=TC5],[TC6=TC6] [--enabled]
        [--profile-description=PROFILE_DESCRIPTION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects application-awareness
    configure-bandwidth-percentage-policy is used to configure bandwidth
    percentage policy for using application awareness on interconnect.

    For an example, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To configure bandwidth percentage policy for an interconnect
    example-interconnect, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects application-awareness \
            configure-bandwidth-percentage-policy example-interconnect \
            --bandwidth-percentages="TC1=5,TC2=5,TC3=75,TC4=5,TC5=5,TC6=5" \
            --enabled --profile-description="some string"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect to patch.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --bandwidth-percentages=[TC1=TC1],[TC2=TC2],[TC3=TC3],[TC4=TC4],[TC5=TC5],[TC6=TC6]
        A list of bandwidth percentages, for configuring the bandwidth
        percentage policy or traffic shaping.

        For configuring bandwidth percentages for the bandwidth percentage
        policy:

        1. Each bandwidth percentage value must be an integer between 1-100. 2.
        It is required to provide a percentage value for each class. 3. The sum
        of all bandwidth percentages must be 100.

        For configuring bandwidth percentages for traffic shaping:

        1. Each bandwidth percentage value must be an integer between 1-100. 2.
        It is not required to provide a percentage value for each class. 3. The
        sum of all bandwidth percentages does not need to be 100.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --enabled
        Enable or disable application awareness on the interconnect.
        Application awareness enablement will fail if the application awareness
        configuration is not specified. Use --no-enabled to disable it.

     --profile-description=PROFILE_DESCRIPTION
        Add profile description for application awareness.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects application-awareness \
            configure-bandwidth-percentage-policy

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects application-awareness \
            configure-bandwidth-percentage-policy
