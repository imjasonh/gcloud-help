NAME
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects application-awareness
        configure-shaper-average-percentage - configure shaper average
        percentage for application awareness configuration of a Compute Engine
        interconnect

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects application-awareness
        configure-shaper-average-percentage NAME
        --bandwidth-percentages=[TC1=TC1],
          [TC2=TC2],[TC3=TC3],[TC4=TC4],[TC5=TC5],[TC6=TC6] [--enabled]
        [--profile-description=PROFILE_DESCRIPTION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects application-awareness
    configure-shaper-average-percentage is used to configure shaper average
    percentage for using application awareness on interconnect. Note that an
    application awareness policy (strict priority or bandwidth percentage)
    should be configure before configuring traffic shaping.

    For an example, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To configure shaper average percentage for an interconnect
    example-interconnect, run:

    $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects application-awareness \        configure-shaper-average-percentage example-interconnect \
        --bandwidth-percentages="TC1=30,TC2=90" --enabled \
        --profile_description="some string"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect to patch.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --bandwidth-percentages=[TC1=TC1],[TC2=TC2],[TC3=TC3],[TC4=TC4],[TC5=TC5],[TC6=TC6]
        A list of bandwidth percentages, for configuring the bandwidth
        percentage policy or traffic shaping.

        For configuring bandwidth percentages for the bandwidth percentage
        policy:

        1. Each bandwidth percentage value must be an integer between 1-100. 2.
        It is required to provide a percentage value for each class. 3. The sum
        of all bandwidth percentages must be 100.

        For configuring bandwidth percentages for traffic shaping:

        1. Each bandwidth percentage value must be an integer between 1-100. 2.
        It is not required to provide a percentage value for each class. 3. The
        sum of all bandwidth percentages does not need to be 100.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --enabled
        Enable or disable application awareness on the interconnect.
        Application awareness enablement will fail if the application awareness
        configuration is not specified. Use --no-enabled to disable it.

     --profile-description=PROFILE_DESCRIPTION
        Add profile description for application awareness.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects application-awareness \
            configure-shaper-average-percentage
