DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects wire-groups create is used to
    create wire groups. A wire group represents a group of redundant wires
    between interconnects in two different metros. Each WireGroup belongs to a
    CrossSiteNetwork.

    For an example, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create a wire group, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects wire-groups create example-wg \
            --cross-site-network=example-csn --bandwidth-unmetered=1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the wire group to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --bandwidth-allocation=BANDWIDTH_ALLOCATION
        The bandwidth allocation for the wire group. BANDWIDTH_ALLOCATION must
        be one of:

         ALLOCATE_PER_WIRE
            Configures a separate unmetered bandwidth allocation (and
            associated charges) for each wire in the group.
         SHARED_WITH_WIRE_GROUP
            Configures one unmetered bandwidth allocation for the wire group.
            The unmetered bandwidth is divided equally across each wire in the
            group, but dynamic throttling reallocates unused unmetered
            bandwidth from unused or underused wires to other wires in the
            group.

     --bandwidth-unmetered=BANDWIDTH_UNMETERED
        The amount of unmetered bandwidth to assign to the wire group.

     --cross-site-network=CROSS_SITE_NETWORK
        Name of the crossSiteNetwork to operate on.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --admin-enabled
        Administrative status of the wire group. If not provided on creation,
        defaults to enabled. When this is enabled, the wire group is
        operational and will carry traffic. Use --no-admin-enabled to disable
        it.

     --bandwidth-metered=BANDWIDTH_METERED
        The amount of metered bandwidth to assign to the wire group.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the wire group.

     --fault-response=FAULT_RESPONSE
        The fault response for the wire group. FAULT_RESPONSE must be one of:

         DISABLE_PORT
            Disable port
         NONE
            None

     --network-service-class=NETWORK_SERVICE_CLASS
        The network service class for the wire group. NETWORK_SERVICE_CLASS
        must be one of:

         BRONZE
            The lowest service class.
         GOLD
            The highest service class.

     --type=TYPE
        The type for the wire group. TYPE must be one of:

         BOX_AND_CROSS
            Box and cross type wire groups must have two VLAN tags. The first
            is for the same-zone pseudowire, and the second is for the
            cross-zone pseudowire.
         REDUNDANT
            Redundant type wire groups must have only one VLAN tag.
         WIRE
            Single wire type wire groups must have only one VLAN tag.

     --validate-only
        Validate the new configuration, but don't update it.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects wire-groups create

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects wire-groups create
