NAME
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects groups update - update a Compute Engine
        interconnect group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects groups update NAME
        [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--intended-topology-capability=INTENDED_TOPOLOGY_CAPABILITY]
        [--interconnects=[INTERCONNECT,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects groups update is used to update
    interconnect groups.

    For an example, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To update an interconnect group example-interconnect-group's intended
    topology capability to PRODUCTION_CRITICAL, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects groups update \
            example-interconnect-group \
            --intended-topology-capability=PRODUCTION_CRITICAL

    To update an interconnect group example-interconnect-group's description to
    "example interconnect group description", run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects groups update \
            example-interconnect-group \
            --description="example interconnect group description"

    To update an interconnect group example-interconnect-group's member
    interconnects to interconnect-1 and interconnect-2, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects groups update \
            example-interconnect-group \
            --interconnects=interconnect-1,interconnect-2

    Although you can add or remove member interconnects using this command, it
    is recommended to add or remove member interconnects using the add-members
    and remove-members commands.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect group to update.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the interconnect group.

     --intended-topology-capability=INTENDED_TOPOLOGY_CAPABILITY
        The reliability the user intends this group to be capable of, in terms
        of the Interconnect product SLAs.

     --interconnects=[INTERCONNECT,...]
        Member interconnects to set the interconnect group to contain.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects groups update

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects groups update
