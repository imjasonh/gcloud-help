NAME
    gcloud alpha compute storage-pools list - view storage pools

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute storage-pools list [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) View storage pools.

    The compact, default output format is explained below:

    The type column contains all three types -- storage pool type, capacity and
    performance. For example, the value

    > "Hdb/Adv/Std"

    means the storage pool type is "hyperdisk-balanced", its capacity type is
    "advanced", and its performance type is "standard."

    The list of storage pool abbreviations is as follows:

      ▪ HdB: Hyperdisk Balanced
      ▪ HdT: Hyperdisk Throughput

    The list of capacity/performance abbreviations is as follows:

      ▪ Adv: Advanced
      ▪ Std: Standard

    The capacity column, and standard-performance iops and throughput columns
    describe the used, provisioned, and the utilization rate. For example, the
    following value for capacity:

    40 / 50 (80%)

    means 40 TB of it is used, 50 TB provisioned, and its utilization rate is
    80%. The utilization rate is equivalent to used capacity divided by
    provisioned capacity.

    For advanced-performance storage pools, the iops and throughput columns
    will simply show the provisioned values.

EXAMPLES
    To display all storage pools in all regions and zones, run the following
    command:

        $ gcloud alpha compute storage-pools list

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the compute/alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/compute/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute storage-pools list

        $ gcloud beta compute storage-pools list
