SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute backend-buckets delete BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute backend-buckets delete deletes one or more
    backend buckets.

    To delete a global backend bucket, run either of the following:

        $ gcloud alpha compute backend-buckets delete my-backend-bucket
          --gcs-bucket-name gcs-bucket-1
          --global

        $ gcloud alpha compute backend-buckets delete my-backend-bucket
          --gcs-bucket-name gcs-bucket-1

    To delete a regional backend bucket, run the following:

        $ gcloud alpha compute backend-buckets delete my-backend-bucket
          --gcs-bucket-name gcs-bucket-1
          --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME [BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME ...]
        Names of the backend buckets to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the backend buckets are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the backend buckets to delete. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute backend-buckets delete

        $ gcloud beta compute backend-buckets delete
