SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute disks GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Read and manipulate Compute Engine disks.

    For more information about disks, see the disks documentation

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute disks

        $ gcloud beta compute disks
