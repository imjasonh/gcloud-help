NAME
    gcloud alpha compute disks wait-for-replication-catchup - provides the
        operation id for the asynchronous replication of a Compute Engine
        persistent disk-pair that can be used to wait for the replication to
        catch up

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute disks wait-for-replication-catchup DISK_NAME
        [--max-wait-duration=MAX_WAIT_DURATION] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute disks wait-for-replication-catchup fetches the
    operation id that can be used to track the status of async replication for
    a Compute Engine persistent disk-pair. The operation id can be used to wait
    for the replication to catch up. This command can be invoked only on the
    primary disk.

EXAMPLES
    Note: The max-wait-duration is optional. If not specified, the default
    value would be picked up from the API. Wait for replication catchup can
    only be invoked on the primary scope. To wait for the replication catchup
    for the primary disk 'my-disk-1' in zone 'us-east1-a' under project
    'my-project1' to catch up with the secondary disk 'my-disk-2' in zone
    'us-west1-a' in any project, the following command can be used (with custom
    wait duration of 20s):

        $ gcloud alpha compute disks wait-for-replication-catchup \
            my-disk-1 --zone=us-east1-a --project=my-project1 \
            --max-wait-duration=20s

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME
        Name of the disk to operate on.

FLAGS
     --max-wait-duration=MAX_WAIT_DURATION
        Maximum duration to wait for the replication catchup.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the disk to operate on. If not specified, you might be
          prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the disk to operate on. If not specified and the compute/zone
          property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
          (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
