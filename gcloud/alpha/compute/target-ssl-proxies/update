NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-ssl-proxies update - update a target SSL proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-ssl-proxies update NAME
        [--backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE] [--proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER]
        [--clear-ssl-policy | --ssl-policy=SSL_POLICY --global-ssl-policy
          | --ssl-policy-region=SSL_POLICY_REGION]
        [--ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[...] | --clear-ssl-certificates
          | --certificate-map=CERTIFICATE_MAP | --clear-certificate-map]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-ssl-proxies update is used to replace
    the SSL certificate, backend service, proxy header or SSL policy of
    existing target SSL proxies. A target SSL proxy is referenced by one or
    more forwarding rules which define which packets the proxy is responsible
    for routing. The target SSL proxy in turn points to a backend service which
    will handle the requests. The target SSL proxy also points to at most 15
    SSL certificates used for server-side authentication or one certificate
    map. The target SSL proxy can be associated with at most one SSL policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target SSL proxy to update.

FLAGS
     --backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE
        A backend service that will be used for connections to the target SSL
        proxy.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER
        The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend.
        PROXY_HEADER must be one of:

         NONE
            No proxy header is added.
         PROXY_V1
            Enables PROXY protocol (version 1) for passing client connection
            information.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-ssl-policy
          Removes any attached SSL policy from the SSL proxy.

       --ssl-policy=SSL_POLICY
          A reference to an SSL policy resource that defines the server-side
          support for SSL features and affects the connections between clients
          and the SSL proxy load balancer. The SSL policy must exist and cannot
          be deleted while referenced by a target SSL proxy.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --global-ssl-policy
            If set, the SSL policy is global.

         --ssl-policy-region=SSL_POLICY_REGION
            Region of the SSL policy to operate on. Overrides the default
            compute/region property value for this command invocation.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[...]
          References to at most 15 SSL certificate resources that are used for
          server-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
          considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load
          balancer. The SSL certificates must exist and cannot be deleted while
          referenced by a target SSL proxy.

       --clear-ssl-certificates
          Remove any attached SSL certificates from the SSL proxy.

       Certificate map resource - The certificate map to attach. This
       represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
       arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
       attribute:
        ▸ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line with a
          fully specified name;
        ▸ provide the argument --project on the command line;
        ▸ set the property core/project. To set the location attribute:
        ▸ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line with a
          fully specified name;
        ▸ default value of location is [global].

         --certificate-map=CERTIFICATE_MAP
            ID of the certificate map or fully qualified identifier for the
            certificate map. To set the map attribute:
            ▫ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line.

       --clear-certificate-map
          Removes any attached certificate map from the SSL proxy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute target-ssl-proxies update

        $ gcloud beta compute target-ssl-proxies update
