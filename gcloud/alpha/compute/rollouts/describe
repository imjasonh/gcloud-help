API REFERENCE
    This command uses the compute/alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/compute/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute rollouts describe
