NAME
    gcloud alpha compute project-info describe - describe the Compute Engine
        project resource

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute project-info describe [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute project-info describe displays all data
    associated with the Compute Engine project resource. The project resource
    contains data such as global quotas, common instance metadata, and the
    project's creation time.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute project-info describe

        $ gcloud beta compute project-info describe
