REQUIRED FLAGS
        Specify the properties of the resources that you want to view the availability of.

    Exactly one of these must be specified:

        You must define the version and number of TPUs to reserve.

          --chip-count=CHIP_COUNT
             The number of chips to check for availability.

             This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
             in this group are specified.

          --tpu-version=TPU_VERSION
             The version of Cloud TPU to reserve. TPU_VERSION must be one of:

              V5E
                 Cloud TPU v5e Lite
              V5P
                 Cloud TPU v5p
              V6E
                 Cloud TPU v6e

             This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
             in this group are specified.

          --workload-type=WORKLOAD_TYPE
             Type of the workload that will be running on the reserved TPUs.
             WORKLOAD_TYPE must be one of:

              BATCH
                 Reserved resources will be optimized for BATCH workloads that
                 handle large amounts of data in single or multiple operations,
                 such as ML training workloads.
              SERVING
                 Reserved resources will be optimized for SERVING workloads
                 that handle concurrent requests and require minimal network
                 latency, such as ML inference.

        Define individual instance properties for the specific SKU reservation.

          --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
             The type of machine (name only) that has a fixed number of vCPUs
             and a fixed amount of memory. You can also specify a custom
             machine type by using the pattern
             custom-number_of_CPUs-amount_of_memory-for example,
             custom-32-29440.

             This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
             in this group are specified.

          --vm-count=VM_COUNT
             The number of instances to check for availability.

             This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
             in this group are specified.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --duration-range=[max=MAX],[min=MIN]
        A duration range for the duration of the Future Reservation. Defined as
        a list of key-value pairs.

        The key is either "min" or "max", and the value is a duration in
        seconds. For example, specify 30m for a duration of 30 minutes or
        specify 1d2h3m4s for a duration of 1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4
        seconds.

        See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

         min
            The minimum duration of the Future Reservation.
         max
            The maximum duration of the Future Reservation.

            Example:

                gcloud compute advice calendar-mode --duration-range=min=24h,max=72h

     --end-time-range=[from=FROM],[to=TO]
        A time range for the end time of the Future Reservation. Defined as a
        list of key-value pairs.

        The key is either "from" or "to", and the value is a datetime. See $
        gcloud topic datetimes for information on time formats.

         from
            The earliest possible end time for the reservation.
         to
            The latest possible end time for the reservation.

            Example:

                gcloud compute advice calendar-mode --end-time-range=from=2024-08-01T00:00:00Z,to=2024-08-02T00:00:00Z

     --location-policy=[ZONE=POLICY,...]
        Policy for which zones to include or exclude when looking for the
        optimal time window and zone for Future Reservations within a region.
        Policy is defined as a list of key-value pairs, with the key being the
        zone name, and value being the applied policy. Available policies are
        allow and deny. Default for zones if left unspecified is allow.

        Example:

            gcloud compute advice calendar-mode --location-policy=us-central1-a=allow,us-central1-b=deny

     --region=REGION
        Region of the to None. If not specified, you might be prompted to
        select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --start-time-range=[from=FROM],[to=TO]
        A time range for the start time of the Future Reservation. Defined as a
        list of key-value pairs.

        The key is either "from" or "to", and the value is a datetime. See $
        gcloud topic datetimes for information on time formats.

         from
            The earliest possible start time for the reservation.
         to
            The latest possible start time for the reservation.

            Example:

                gcloud compute advice calendar-mode --start-time-range=from=2024-08-01T00:00:00Z,to=2024-08-02T00:00:00Z

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:
