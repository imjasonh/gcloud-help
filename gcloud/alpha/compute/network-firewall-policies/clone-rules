NAME
    gcloud alpha compute network-firewall-policies clone-rules - replace the
        rules of a Compute Engine network firewall policy with rules from
        another policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute network-firewall-policies clone-rules FIREWALL_POLICY
        --source-firewall-policy=SOURCE_FIREWALL_POLICY
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute network-firewall-policies clone-rules is used
    to replace the rules of network firewall policies. A network firewall
    policy is a set of rules that controls access to various resources.

EXAMPLES
    To clone the rules of a global network firewall policy with NAME my-policy,
    from another network firewall policy with NAME source-policy, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute network-firewall-policies clone-rules \
            my-policy --source-firewall-policy=source-policy --global

    To clone the rules of a region network firewall policy with NAME
    my-region-policy, in region region-a, from another network firewall policy
    with NAME source-policy, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute network-firewall-policies clone-rules \
            my-region-policy --source-firewall-policy=source-policy \
            --region=region-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FIREWALL_POLICY
        name of the network firewall policy to clone the rules to.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --source-firewall-policy=SOURCE_FIREWALL_POLICY
        Name of the source network firewall policy to copy the rules from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the firewall policy is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the firewall policy to clone-rules. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute network-firewall-policies clone-rules

        $ gcloud beta compute network-firewall-policies clone-rules
