    gcloud alpha compute network-firewall-policies associations delete - delete

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute network-firewall-policies associations delete
        --firewall-policy=FIREWALL_POLICY --name=NAME
        [--firewall-policy-region=FIREWALL_POLICY_REGION
          | --global-firewall-policy] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute network-firewall-policies associations delete
    is used to delete network firewall policy associations. An network firewall
    policy is a set of rules that controls access to various resources.

EXAMPLES
    To delete an association from a global network firewall policy with NAME
    my-policy and association name my-association, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute network-firewall-policies associations \
            delete --firewall-policy=my-policy --name=my-association \
            --global-firewall-policy

    To delete an association from a regional network firewall policy with NAME
    my-policy in region region-a and association name my-association, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute network-firewall-policies associations \
            delete --firewall-policy=my-policy --name=my-association \
            --firewall-policy-region=region-a

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --firewall-policy=FIREWALL_POLICY
        Firewall policy ID with which to delete association.

     --name=NAME
        Name of the association to delete.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --firewall-policy-region=FIREWALL_POLICY_REGION
          Region of the firewall policy to delete. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

       --global-firewall-policy
          If set, the firewall policy is global.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
