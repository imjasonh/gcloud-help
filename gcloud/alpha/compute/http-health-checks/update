NAME
    gcloud alpha compute http-health-checks update - update a legacy HTTP
        health check

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute http-health-checks update NAME
        [--check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD] [--host=HOST] [--port=PORT]
        [--request-path=REQUEST_PATH] [--timeout=TIMEOUT]
        [--unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute http-health-checks update is used to update an
    existing legacy HTTP health check. Only arguments passed in will be updated
    on the health check. Other attributes will remain unaffected.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the HTTP health check to update.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. See $ gcloud topic
        datetimes for information on duration formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A textual description for the HTTP health check. Pass in an empty
        string to unset.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy.

     --host=HOST
        The value of the host header used in this HTTP health check request. By
        default, this is empty and Compute Engine automatically sets the host
        header in health requests to the same external IP address as the
        forwarding rule associated with the target pool. Setting this to an
        empty string will clear any existing host value.

     --port=PORT
        The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

     --request-path=REQUEST_PATH
        The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
        /healthcheck.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        If Compute Engine doesn't receive an HTTP 200 response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. Valid units for this flag are ``s'' for seconds and ``m'' for
        minutes.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute http-health-checks update

        $ gcloud beta compute http-health-checks update
