        health check

        [--check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2] [--host=HOST]
        [--port=PORT; default=80] [--request-path=REQUEST_PATH; default="/"]
        [--timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"]
        [--unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Legacy HTTP health checks are required if you want to implement
    health checking for a target pool backend of an external passthrough
    Network Load Balancer. Though you can use legacy HTTP health checks in
    certain other Google Cloud Platform load balancing configurations and for
    managed instance group autohealing, you should consider a non-legacy HTTP
    health check created with health-checks create http instead.

    For more information about the differences between legacy and non-legacy
    health checks see:
    https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-check-concepts#category_and_protocol

    For information about what type of health check to use for a particular
    load balancer, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-check-concepts#lb_guide

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the HTTP health check to create.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value
        is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the HTTP health check.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

     --host=HOST
        The value of the host header used in this HTTP health check request. By
        default, this is empty and Compute Engine automatically sets the host
        header in health requests to the same external IP address as the
        forwarding rule associated with the target pool.

     --port=PORT; default=80
        The TCP port number that this health check monitors. The default value
        is 80.

     --request-path=REQUEST_PATH; default="/"
        The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
        /healthcheck. The default value is ``/''.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"
        If Compute Engine doesn't receive an HTTP 200 response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. The default value is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute http-health-checks create

        $ gcloud beta compute http-health-checks create
