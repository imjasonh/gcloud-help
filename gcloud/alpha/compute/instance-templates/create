DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-templates create facilitates the
    creation of Compute Engine virtual machine instance templates. Instance
    templates are global resources, and can be used to create instances in any
    zone.

EXAMPLES
    To create an instance template named 'INSTANCE-TEMPLATE' with the 'n2' vm
    type, '9GB' memory, and 2 CPU cores, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-templates create INSTANCE-TEMPLATE \
            --custom-vm-type=n2 --custom-cpu=2 --custom-memory=9GB

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the instance template to create.

FLAGS
     --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
        Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

         type
            The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-t4 for NVIDIA T4) of
            accelerator to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute
            accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
            types.

         count
            Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default
            value is 1.

     --boot-disk-auto-delete
        Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted.
        Enabled by default, use --no-boot-disk-auto-delete to disable.

     --boot-disk-device-name=BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
        The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This
        option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
        opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

     --boot-disk-interface=BOOT_DISK_INTERFACE
        Indicates the interface to use for the boot disk. The value must be one
        of the following:
        ◆ SCSI
        ◆ NVME

     --boot-disk-provisioned-iops=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_IOPS
        Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the number
        of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle.

     --boot-disk-provisioned-throughput=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_THROUGHPUT
        Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk. This sets the
        number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.

     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
        terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. Disk size
        must be a multiple of 1 GB. Default size unit is GB.

     --boot-disk-type=BOOT_DISK_TYPE
        The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
        compute disk-types list.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
        non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

     --configure-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        This option has effect only when used with --source-instance. It allows
        you to override how the source-instance's disks are defined in the
        template.

         device-name
            Name of the device for which the configuration is being overridden.

         auto-delete
            If true, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when
            the instance is deleted. However, if the disk is detached from the
            instance, this option won't apply. If not provided, the setting is
            copied from the source instance. Allowed values of the flag are:
            false, no, true, and yes.

         instantiate-from
            Specifies whether to include the disk and which image to use. Valid
            values are: attach-read-only, blank, custom-image, do-not-include,
            source-image, source-image-family

         custom-image
            The custom image to use if custom-image is specified for
            instantiate-from.

     --create-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

         name
            Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if
            more than one instance is being created.

         description
            Optional textual description for the disk being created.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default.

         image
            Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized
            with. A new disk will be created based on the given image. To view
            a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud compute images
            list. It is best practice to use image when a specific version of
            an image is needed. If both image and image-family flags are
            omitted a blank disk will be created.

         image-family
            The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will
            be initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux
            distributions, some of which are available as both regular and
            Shielded VM images. When a family is specified instead of an image,
            the latest non-deprecated image associated with that family is
            used. It is best practice to use --image-family when the latest
            version of an image is needed.

         image-project
            The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
            references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
            image-project. A full list of available image projects can be
            generated by running gcloud compute images list.

            ▸ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
              provided.
            ▸ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
              projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to
              be used.
            ▸ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided,
              the current default project is used.

         size
            The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
            a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,
            or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte
            disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the
            default image size will be used for the new disk.

         type
            The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $
            gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
            pd-standard.

         device-name
            An optional name to display the disk name in the guest operating
            system. If omitted, a device name of the form persistent-disk-N is
            used.

         provisioned-iops
            Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the
            number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value
            must be between 10,000 and 120,000.

         provisioned-throughput
            Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk. This sets
            the number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.

         disk-resource-policy
            Resource policy to apply to the disk. Specify a full or partial
            URL. For example:
            ▸ https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy
            ▸ projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy

            For more information, see the following docs:
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/resource-policies/
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

         architecture
            Specifies the architecture or processor type that this disk can
            support. For available processor types on Compute Engine, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms.

         storage-pool
            The name of the storage pool in which the new disk is created. The
            new disk and the storage pool must be in the same location.

         interface
            The interface to use with the disk. The value must be one of the
            following:
            ▸ SCSI
            ▸ NVME

         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The instance will use
            the first partition of the disk for its root file system. The
            default value for this is no.

         kms-key
            Fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name that will protect the
            disk.

            This can either be the fully qualified path or the name.

            The fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name format is:
            projects/<kms-project>/locations/<kms-location>/keyRings/<kms-keyring>/
            cryptoKeys/<key-name>.

            If the value is not fully qualified then kms-location, kms-keyring,
            and optionally kms-project are required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-project
            Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the
            disk.

            If the project is not specified then the project where the disk is
            being created will be used.

            If this flag is set then key-location, kms-keyring, and kms-key are
            required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-location
            Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the
            disk.

            All Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a list
            of possible locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'. If this flag
            is set then kms-keyring and kms-key are required. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-keyring
            The keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will
            protect the disk.

            If this flag is set then kms-location and kms-key are required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         multi-writer
            If yes, the disk is created in multi-writer mode so that it can be
            attached with read-write access to two VMs. The default value is
            no. The multi-writer feature requires specialized filesystems,
            among other restrictions. For more information, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/sharing-disks-between-vms.

         replica-zones
            Required for each regional disk associated with the instance.
            Specify the URLs of the zones where the disk should be replicated
            to. You must provide exactly two replica zones, and one zone must
            be the same as the instance zone.

         labels
            List of label KEY=VALUE pairs separated by : character to add to
            the disk.

            Example: Key1=Value1:Key2=Value2:Key3=Value3.

            Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
            (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values
            must contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase
            characters, and numbers.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description for the instance template.

     --discard-local-ssds-at-termination-timestamp=DISCARD_LOCAL_SSDS_AT_TERMINATION_TIMESTAMP
        Required to be set to true and only allowed for VMs that have one or
        more local SSDs, use --instance-termination-action=STOP, and use either
        --max-run-duration or --termination-time.

        This flag indicates the value that you want Compute Engine to use for
        the --discard-local-ssd flag in the automatic gcloud compute instances
        stop command. This flag only supports the true value, which discards
        local SSD data when automatically stopping this VM during its
        terminationTimestamp.

        For more information about the --discard-local-ssd flag, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#stop_instance.

     --disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[boot=BOOT],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[interface=INTERFACE],[mode=MODE],[name=NAME]
        Attaches an existing disk to the instances.

         name
            The disk to attach to the instances. If you create more than one
            instance, you can only attach a disk in read-only mode. By default,
            you attach a zonal disk located in the same zone of the instance.
            If you want to attach a regional disk, you must specify the disk
            using its URI; for example,
            projects/myproject/regions/us-central1/disks/my-regional-disk.

         mode
            The mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for read-only mode
            and rw for read-write mode. If omitted, rw is used as a default
            value. If you use rw when creating more than one instance, you
            encounter errors.

         boot
            If set to yes, you attach a boot disk. The virtual machine then
            uses the first partition of the disk for the root file systems. The
            default value for this is no.

         device-name
            An optional name to display the disk name in the guest operating
            system. If omitted, a device name of the form persistent-disk-N is
            used.

         auto-delete
            If set to yes, the persistent disk is automatically deleted when
            the instance is deleted. However, if you detach the disk from the
            instance, deleting the instance doesn't delete the disk. The
            default value is yes.

         interface
            The interface to use for the disk. The value must be one of the
            following:
            ▸ SCSI
            ▸ NVME

     --enable-display-device
        Enable a display device on VM instances. Disabled by default.

     --[no-]enable-nested-virtualization
        If set to true, enables nested virtualization for the instance. Use
        --enable-nested-virtualization to enable and
        --no-enable-nested-virtualization to disable.

     --[no-]enable-uefi-networking
        If set to true, enables UEFI networking for the instance creation. Use
        --enable-uefi-networking to enable and --no-enable-uefi-networking to

            terabyte disk. Allowed values are: 3TB and 6TB and the default is 3
            TB.

     --local-ssd=[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
        Attaches a local SSD to the instances.

         device-name
            Optional. A name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Can only be specified if interface is SCSI. If
            omitted, a device name of the form local-ssd-N will be used.

         interface
            Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this
            SSD. Valid values are SCSI and NVME. SCSI is the default and is
            supported by more guest operating systems. NVME might provide

        being 1 hour.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

        MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL must be (only one value is supported):

         PERIODIC
            PERIODIC means the VM is a Stable Fleet VM.

     --max-run-duration=MAX_RUN_DURATION
        Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a duration
        relative to the last time when the VM began running. Format the
        duration, MAX_RUN_DURATION, as the number of days, hours, minutes, and
        seconds followed by d, h, m, and s respectively. For example, specify
        30m for a duration of 30 minutes or specify 1d2h3m4s for a duration of
        1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4 seconds. Alternatively, to specify a
        timestamp, use --termination-time instead.

        If neither --max-run-duration nor --termination-time is specified
        (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or
        system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to
        be automatically terminated at the VM's termination timestamp
        (terminationTimestamp) using the action specified by
        --instance-termination-action.

        Note: The terminationTimestamp is removed whenever the VM is stopped or
        suspended and redefined whenever the VM is rerun. For
        --max-run-duration specifically, the terminationTimestamp is the sum of
        MAX_RUN_DURATION and the time when the VM last entered the RUNNING
        state, which changes whenever the VM is rerun.

     --mesh=[gke-cluster=GKE-CLUSTER],[workload=WORKLOAD]
        Controls whether the Anthos Service Mesh service proxy (Envoy) and
        agent are installed and configured on the VM. "cloud-platform" scope is
        enabled automatically to allow the service proxy to be started. Do not
        use the --no-scopes flag.

         gke-cluster
            The location/name of the GKE cluster. The location can be a zone or
            a region, e.g. us-central1-a/my-cluster.

         workload
            The workload identifier of the VM. In a GKE cluster, it is the
            identifier namespace/name of the WorkloadGroup custom resource
            representing the VM workload, e.g. foo/my-workload.

     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128
        bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for
        all metadata entries is 512 KB.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

            For startup scripts on Windows instances, the following metadata
            keys have special meanings: windows-startup-script-url,
            windows-startup-script-cmd, windows-startup-script-bat,
            windows-startup-script-ps1, sysprep-specialize-script-url,
            sysprep-specialize-script-cmd, sysprep-specialize-script-bat, and
            sysprep-specialize-script-ps1. For more information, see Running
            startup scripts
            (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript).

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud alpha compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        You can find more information on-line:

         internal-ipv6-address
            Assigns the given internal IPv6 address or range to the instance
            that is created. The address must be the first IP address in the
            range or from a /96 IP address range. This option can be used only
            when creating a single instance.

         internal-ipv6-prefix-length
            Optional field that indicates the prefix length of the internal
            IPv6 address range. It should be used together with
            internal-ipv6-address. Only /96 IP address range is supported and
            the default value is 96. If not set, either the prefix length from
            --internal-ipv6-address will be used or the default value of 96
            will be assigned.

         external-ipv6-address

            For example:

                --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"

            Each IP alias range consists of a range name and a CIDR netmask
            (e.g. /24) separated by a colon or just the netmask. The range name
            is the name of the range within the network interface's subnet from
            which to allocate an IP alias range. If unspecified, it defaults to
            the primary IP range of the subnet. The IP allocator will pick an

            This enables architecturally defined non-last level cache (LLC)
            events.
         enhanced
            This enables most documented core/L2 and LLC events.
         standard
            This enables most documented core/L2 events.

     --post-key-revocation-action-type=POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the instance when the KMS key of one of its
        attached disks is revoked. The default is noop. POLICY must be one of:

            runtime, they come at a discounted price.
         STANDARD
            The default option. The STANDARD provisioning model gives you full
            control over your VM instances' runtime.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to attach. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

        created using this instance template. If you attach any resource
        policies to an instance template, you can only use that instance
        template to create instances that are in the same region as the
        resource policies. Do not include resource policies that are located in
        different regions in the same instance template.

     --restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.
        Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --shielded-integrity-monitoring
        Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the
        instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy
        baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly
        trusted boot image when the instance is created. This baseline can be
        updated by using gcloud compute instances update
        --shielded-learn-integrity-policy. On Shielded VM instances, integrity
        monitoring is enabled by default. For information about how to modify
        Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.
        For information about monitoring integrity on Shielded VM instances,
        see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/integrity-monitoring."

     --shielded-secure-boot
        The instance boots with secure boot enabled. On Shielded VM instances,
        Secure Boot is not enabled by default. For information about how to
        modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --shielded-vtpm
        The instance boots with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled. A
        TPM is a hardware module that can be used for different security
        operations such as remote attestation, encryption, and sealing of keys.
        On Shielded VM instances, vTPM is enabled by default. For information
        about how to modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --source-instance=SOURCE_INSTANCE
        The name of the source instance that the instance template will be
        created from.

     --source-instance-zone=SOURCE_INSTANCE_ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. Overrides the default compute/zone
        property value for this command invocation.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        Specifies whether IPv6 is enabled on the default network interface. If
        not specified, IPV4_ONLY will be used. STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            The network interface can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
         IPV4_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv4 addresses
         IPV6_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv6 addresses

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet that the VM instances are a part of. If --network
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by the --network flag.

     --subnet-region=SUBNET_REGION
        Specifies the region of the subnetwork.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instance. These tags allow
        network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1) for more
        details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list instances with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list instances tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     --termination-time=TERMINATION_TIME
        Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a time. Format
        the time, TERMINATION_TIME, as a RFC 3339 timestamp. For more
        information, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339. Alternatively, to
        specify a duration, use --max-run-duration instead.

        If neither --termination-time nor --max-run-duration is specified
        (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or
        system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to
        be automatically terminated at the VM's termination timestamp
        (terminationTimestamp) using the action specified by
        --instance-termination-action.

        Note: The terminationTimestamp is removed whenever the VM is stopped or
        suspended and redefined whenever the VM is rerun. For
        --termination-time specifically, the terminationTimestamp remains the
        same whenever the VM is rerun, but any requests to rerun the VM fail if
        the specified timestamp is in the past.

     --threads-per-core=THREADS_PER_CORE
        The number of visible threads per physical core. To disable
        simultaneous multithreading (SMT) set this to 1. Valid values are: 1 or
        2.

        For more information about configuring SMT, see:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/configuring-simultaneous-multithreading.

     --turbo-mode=TURBO_MODE
        Turbo mode to use for the instance. Supported modes include:
        ◆ ALL_CORE_MAX

        To achieve all-core-turbo frequency for more consistent CPU
        performance, set the field to ALL_CORE_MAX. The field is unset by
        default, which results in maximum performance single-core boosting.

     --visible-core-count=VISIBLE_CORE_COUNT
        The number of physical cores to expose to the instance's guest
        operating system. The number of virtual CPUs visible to the instance's
        guest operating system is this number of cores multiplied by the
        instance's count of visible threads per physical core.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --address=ADDRESS
          Assigns the given external IP address to the instance that is
          created. This option can only be used when creating a single
          instance.

       --no-address
          If provided, the instances are not assigned external IP addresses. To
          pull container images, you must configure private Google access if
          using Container Registry or configure Cloud NAT for instances to
          access container images directly. For more information, see:
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/using-nat

     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the disk. The 'Compute Engine Service Agent' service

          The Google Cloud location for the key.

          To set the kms-location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-location on the command
            line.

       --boot-disk-kms-project=BOOT_DISK_KMS_PROJECT
          The Google Cloud project for the key.

          To set the kms-project attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-project on the command line;
          ▸ set the property core/project.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --confidential-compute
          (DEPRECATED) The instance boots with Confidential Computing enabled.
          Confidential Computing is based on Secure Encrypted Virtualization
          (SEV), an AMD virtualization feature for running confidential
          instances.

          The --confidential-compute flag will soon be deprecated. Please use
          --confidential-compute-type=SEV instead

       --confidential-compute-type=CONFIDENTIAL_COMPUTE_TYPE
          The instance boots with Confidential Computing enabled. Confidential
          Computing can be based on Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) or
          Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP),
          both of which are AMD virtualization features for running
          confidential instances. Trust Domain eXtension based on Intel
          virtualization features for running confidential instances is also
          supported. CONFIDENTIAL_COMPUTE_TYPE must be one of:

           SEV
              Secure Encrypted Virtualization
           SEV_SNP
              Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging
           TDX
              Trust Domain eXtension

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value specifying the number of cores that are needed
          in the custom machine type.

          For some machine types, shared-core values can also be used. For
          example, for E2 machine types, you can specify micro, small, or
          medium.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies a custom machine type. The default is n1. For more
          information about custom machine types, see:
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#custom_machine_types

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
        references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
        image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated by
        running gcloud projects list.
        ◆ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        ◆ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        ◆ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new
          boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will
          have the same name as the instance. To view a list of public images
          and projects, run $ gcloud compute images list. It is best practice
          to use --image when a specific version of an image is needed.

          When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size
          can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,
          respectively.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be
          initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions,
          some of which are available as both regular and Shielded VM images.
          When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
          non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best
          practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is
          needed.

          By default, debian-12 is assumed for this flag.

     Maintenance Behavior.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
          (DEPRECATED) Specifies the behavior of the VMs when their host
          machines undergo maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. For more
          information, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/host-maintenance-options.

          The --maintenance-policy flag is now deprecated. Please use
          --on-host-maintenance instead. MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

           MIGRATE
              The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
              temporarily impact the performance of instances during a
              migration event.
           TERMINATE
              The instances should be terminated.

       --on-host-maintenance=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
          Specifies the behavior of the VMs when their host machines undergo
          maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. For more information, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/host-maintenance-options.
          MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

           MIGRATE
              The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
              temporarily impact the performance of instances during a
              migration event.
           TERMINATE
              The instances should be terminated.

       --node-affinity-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          The JSON/YAML file containing the configuration of desired nodes onto
          which this instance could be scheduled. These rules filter the nodes
          according to their node affinity labels. A node's affinity labels
          come from the node template of the group the node is in.

          The file should contain a list of a JSON/YAML objects. For an
          example, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/provisioning-sole-tenant-vms#configure_node_affinity_labels.
          The following list describes the fields:

           key
              Corresponds to the node affinity label keys of the Node resource.
           operator
              Specifies the node selection type. Must be one of: IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to seek for matched nodes. NOT_IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to avoid certain nodes.
           values
              Optional. A list of values which correspond to the node affinity
              label values of the Node resource.

              Use a full or relative path to a local file containing the value
              of node_affinity_file.

       --node-group=NODE_GROUP
          The name of the node group to schedule this instance on.

     Specifies the reservation for instances created from this template.

       --reservation=RESERVATION
          The name of the reservation, required when --reservation-affinity is
          one of: specific, specific-then-any-reservation or
          specific-then-no-reservation.

       --reservation-affinity=RESERVATION_AFFINITY; default="any"
          The type of reservation for instances created from this template.
          RESERVATION_AFFINITY must be one of:

           any
              Consume any available, matching reservation.
           none
              Do not consume from any reserved capacity.
           specific
              Must consume from a specific reservation.
           specific-then-any-reservation
              Prefer to consume from a specific reservation, but still consume
              any available matching reservation if the specified reservation
              is not available or exhausted.
           specific-then-no-reservation
              Prefer to consume from a specific reservation, but still consume
              from the on-demand pool if the specified reservation is not
              available or exhausted.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,
          described below.

          SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. Default
          scopes are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

        Controls whether the Traffic Director service proxy (Envoy) and agent
        are installed and configured on the VM. "cloud-platform" scope is
        enabled automatically to allow connections to the Traffic Director API.
        Do not use the --no-scopes flag.

         enabled
            If specified, the service-proxy software will be installed when the
            instance is created. The instance is configured to work with
            Traffic Director.

         serving-ports
            Semi-colon-separated (;) list of the ports, specified inside
            quotation marks ("), on which the customer's application/workload
            is serving.

            For example:

                serving-ports="80;8080"

            The service proxy will intercept inbound traffic, then forward it
            to the specified serving port(s) on localhost. If not provided, no
            incoming traffic is intercepted.

         proxy-port
            The port on which the service proxy listens. The VM intercepts
            traffic and redirects it to this port to be handled by the service
            proxy. If omitted, the default value is '15001'.

         tracing
            Enables the service proxy to generate distributed tracing
            information. If set to ON, the service proxy's control plane
            generates a configuration that enables request ID-based tracing.
            For more information, refer to the generate_request_id
            documentation for the Envoy proxy. Allowed values are ON and OFF.

         access-log
            The filepath for access logs sent to the service proxy by the
            control plane. All incoming and outgoing requests are recorded in
            this file. For more information, refer to the file access log
            documentation for the Envoy proxy.

         network
            The name of a valid VPC network. The Google Cloud Platform VPC
            network used by the service proxy's control plane to generate
            dynamic configuration for the service proxy.

         intercept-dns
            Enables interception of UDP traffic by the service proxy.

         source
            The Google Cloud Storage bucket location source for the Envoy. The
            service-proxy-agent will download the archive from Envoy and
            install it on the virtual machine, unpacking it into the root (/)
            directory of the virtual machine. Therefore, the archive must
            contain not only the executable and license files but they must be
            located in the correct directories within the archive. For example:
            /usr/local/bin/envoy and /usr/local/doc/envoy-LICENSE

         intercept-all-outbound-traffic
            Enables interception of all outgoing traffic. The traffic is
            intercepted by the service proxy and then redirected to external
            host.

         exclude-outbound-ip-ranges
            Semi-colon-separated (;) list of the IPs or CIDRs, specified inside
            quotation marks ("), that should be excluded from redirection. Only
            applies when intercept-all-outbound-traffic flag is set.

            For example:

                exclude-outbound-ip-ranges="8.8.8.8;129.168.10.0/24"

         exclude-outbound-port-ranges
            Semi-colon-separated (;) list of the ports or port ranges,
            specified inside quotation marks ("), that should be excluded from
            redirection. Only applies when intercept-all-outbound-traffic flag
            is set.

            For example:

                exclude-outbound-port-ranges="81;8080-8090"

         scope
            Scope defines a logical configuration boundary for a Gateway
            resource. On VM boot up, the service proxy reaches the Traffic
            Director to retrieve routing information that corresponds to the
            routes attached to the gateway with this scope name. When scope is
            specified, the network value is ignored. You cannot specify scope
            and mesh values at the same time.

         mesh
            Mesh defines a logical configuration boundary for a Mesh resource.
            On VM boot up, the service proxy reaches the Traffic Director to
            retrieve routing information that corresponds to the routes
            attached to the mesh with this mesh name. When mesh is specified,
            the network value is ignored. You cannot specify scope and mesh
            values at the same time.

         project-number
            Project number defines the project where Mesh and Gateway resources
            are created. If not specified, the project where the instance
            exists is used.

     --service-proxy-labels=[KEY=VALUE, ...,...]
        Labels that you can apply to your service proxy. These will be
        reflected in your Envoy proxy's bootstrap metadata. These can be any
        key=value pairs that you want to set as proxy metadata (for example,
        for use with config filtering). You might use these flags for
        application and version labels: app=review and/or version=canary.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-templates create

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-templates create
