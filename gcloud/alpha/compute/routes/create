DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute routes create is used to create routes. A
    route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by the
    virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machine instances by
    tag, and the set of routes for a particular VM is called its routing table.
    For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system searches that
    machine's routing table for a single best matching route.

    Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more
    specific ranges over larger ones (see --destination-range). If there is a
    tie, the system selects the route with the smallest priority value. If
    there is still a tie, it uses the layer 3 and 4 packet headers to select
    just one of the remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as
    specified by --next-hop-address, --next-hop-instance,
    --next-hop-vpn-tunnel, --next-hop-gateway, or --next-hop-ilb of the winning
    route. Packets that do not match any route in the sending virtual machine
    routing table will be dropped.

    Exactly one of --next-hop-address, --next-hop-gateway,
    --next-hop-vpn-tunnel, --next-hop-instance, or --next-hop-ilb must be
    provided with this command.

EXAMPLES
    To create a route with the name 'route-name' with destination range
    '0.0.0.0/0' and with next hop gateway 'default-internet-gateway', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute routes create route-name \
            --destination-range=0.0.0.0/0 \
            --next-hop-gateway=default-internet-gateway

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the route to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --destination-range=DESTINATION_RANGE
        The destination range of outgoing packets that the route will apply to.
        To match all traffic, use ``0.0.0.0/0''.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --next-hop-address=NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS
          Specifies the IP address of an instance that should handle matching
          packets. The instance must have IP forwarding enabled (i.e., include
          --can-ip-forward when creating the instance using gcloud compute
          instances create)

       --next-hop-gateway=NEXT_HOP_GATEWAY
          Specifies the gateway that should handle matching packets. Currently,
          the only acceptable value is default-internet-gateway which is a
          gateway operated by Google Compute Engine.

       --next-hop-ilb=NEXT_HOP_ILB
          Specifies the name or IP address of a forwarding rule for an internal
          TCP/UDP load balancer. The forwarding rule's --load-balancing-scheme
          must be INTERNAL. You can use any --destination-range that doesn't
          exactly match the destination of a subnet route and isn't more
          specific (has a longer subnet mask) than the destination of a subnet
          route. For more information, see
          https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal/ilb-next-hop-overview#destination_range.

       --next-hop-instance=NEXT_HOP_INSTANCE
          Specifies the name of an instance that should handle traffic matching
          this route. When this flag is specified, the zone of the instance
          must be specified using --next-hop-instance-zone.

       --next-hop-vpn-tunnel=NEXT_HOP_VPN_TUNNEL
          The target VPN tunnel that will receive forwarded traffic.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the route.

     --network=NETWORK; default="default"
        Specifies the network to which the route will be applied.

     --next-hop-ilb-region=NEXT_HOP_ILB_REGION
        The region of the next hop forwarding rule. If not specified, you might
        be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --next-hop-instance-zone=NEXT_HOP_INSTANCE_ZONE
        The zone of the next hop instance. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     --next-hop-vpn-tunnel-region=NEXT_HOP_VPN_TUNNEL_REGION
        The region of the next hop vpn tunnel. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --priority=PRIORITY; default=1000
        Specifies the priority of this route relative to other routes with the
        same specificity. The lower the value, the higher the priority.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Identifies the set of instances that this route will apply to. If no
        tags are provided, the route will apply to all instances in the
        network.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute routes create

        $ gcloud beta compute routes create
