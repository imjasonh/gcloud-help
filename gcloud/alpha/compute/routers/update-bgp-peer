DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute routers update-bgp-peer is used to update a
    BGP peer on a Compute Engine router.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the router to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --peer-name=PEER_NAME
        The name of the new BGP peer being updated.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --advertised-route-priority=ADVERTISED_ROUTE_PRIORITY
        The priority of routes advertised to this BGP peer. In the case where
        there is more than one matching route of maximum length, the routes
        with lowest priority value win. 0 <= priority <= 65535. If not
        specified, will use Google-managed priorities.

     --advertisement-mode=MODE
        The new advertisement mode for this peer. MODE must be one of:

         CUSTOM
            Custom (user-configured) BGP advertisements.
         DEFAULT
            Default (Google-managed) BGP advertisements.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --[no-]enable-ipv6
        If IPv6 is enabled, the peer connection can be established with IPv6
        route exchange. If disabled, no IPv6 route exchange is allowed on any
        active session. Use --enable-ipv6 to enable and --no-enable-ipv6 to
        disable.

     --[no-]enabled
        If enabled, the peer connection can be established with routing
        information. If disabled, any active session with the peer is
        terminated and all associated routing information is removed. Use
        --enabled to enable and --no-enabled to disable.

     --interface=INTERFACE
        The name of the interface for this BGP peer.

     --ip-address=IP_ADDRESS
        The link-local address of the Cloud Router interface for this BGP peer.
        Must be a link-local IPv4 address belonging to the range 169.254.0.0/16
        and must belong to same subnet as the interface address of the peer
        router.

     --ipv6-nexthop-address=IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS
        The IPv6 next hop address of the Cloud Router interface for this BGP
        peer. Must be a Google owned global unicast IPv6 address belonging to
        the range 2600:2d00:0:2:0:0:0:0/64 or 2600:2d00:0:3:0:0:0:0/64 and must
        belong to same subnet as the interface address of the peer router.

     --peer-asn=PEER_ASN
        The BGP autonomous system number (ASN) for this BGP peer. Must be a
        16-bit or 32-bit private ASN as defined in
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6996, for example --asn=64512.

     --peer-ip-address=PEER_IP_ADDRESS
        The link-local address of the peer router. Must be a link-local IPv4
        address belonging to the range 169.254.0.0/16.

     --peer-ipv6-nexthop-address=PEER_IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS
        The IPv6 next hop address of the peer router. Must be a Google owned
        global unicast IPv6 address belonging to the range
        2600:2d00:0:2:0:0:0:0/64 or 2600:2d00:0:3:0:0:0:0/64.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the router to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --set-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
        The list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to dynamically advertise on
        this peer. This list can only be specified in custom advertisement
        mode.

        GROUP must be (currently only one value is supported):

         ALL_SUBNETS
            Automatically advertise all available subnets.

     --set-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE=DESC,...]
        The list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to dynamically
        advertise on this peer. Each IP range can (optionally) be given a text
        description DESC. For example, to advertise a specific range, use
        --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24. To store a description with
        the range, use --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24=my-networks.
        This list can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --add-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
          A list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to dynamically advertise on
          this peer. This list is appended to any existing advertisements. This
          field can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

          GROUP must be (currently only one value is supported):

           ALL_SUBNETS
              Automatically advertise all available subnets.

       --add-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE=DESC,...]
          A list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to dynamically
          advertise on this peer. This list is appended to any existing
          advertisements. Each IP range can (optionally) be given a text
          description DESC. For example, to advertise a specific range, use
          --advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24. To store a description with
          the range, use --advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24=my-networks.
          This list can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

       --remove-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
          A list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to remove from dynamic
          advertisement on this peer. Each group in the list must exist in the
          current set of custom advertisements. This field can only be
          specified in custom advertisement mode.

          GROUP must be (currently only one value is supported):

           ALL_SUBNETS
              Automatically advertise all available subnets.

       --remove-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE,...]
          A list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to remove from
          dynamic advertisement on this peer. Each IP range in the list must
          exist in the current set of custom advertisements. This field can
          only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early

        $ gcloud compute routers update-bgp-peer

        $ gcloud beta compute routers update-bgp-peer
