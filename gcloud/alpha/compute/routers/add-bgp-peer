DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Add a BGP peer to a Compute Engine router.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the router to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interface=INTERFACE
        The name of the interface for this BGP peer.

     --peer-asn=PEER_ASN
        The BGP autonomous system number (ASN) for this BGP peer. Must be a
        16-bit or 32-bit private ASN as defined in
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6996, for example --asn=64512.

     --peer-name=PEER_NAME
        The name of the new BGP peer being added.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --advertised-route-priority=ADVERTISED_ROUTE_PRIORITY
        The priority of routes advertised to this BGP peer. In the case where
        there is more than one matching route of maximum length, the routes
        with lowest priority value win. 0 <= priority <= 65535. If not
        specified, will use Google-managed priorities.

     --advertisement-mode=MODE
        The new advertisement mode for this peer. MODE must be one of:

         CUSTOM
            Custom (user-configured) BGP advertisements.
         DEFAULT
            Default (Google-managed) BGP advertisements.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --custom-learned-route-priority=PRIORITY
        An integral value 0 <= priority <= 65535, to be applied to all custom
        learned route IP address ranges for this peer. If not specified, a
        Google-managed priority value of 100 is used. The routes with the
        lowest priority value win.

     --[no-]enable-ipv4
        If IPv4 is enabled, the peer connection can be established with IPv4
        route exchange. If disabled, no IPv4 route exchange is allowed on any
        active session. By default enabled for IPv4-based BGP sessions. Use
        --enable-ipv4 to enable and --no-enable-ipv4 to disable.

     --[no-]enable-ipv6
        If IPv6 is enabled, the peer connection can be established with IPv6
        route exchange. If disabled, no IPv6 route exchange is allowed on any
        active session. Disabled by default. Use --enable-ipv6 to enable and
        --no-enable-ipv6 to disable.

     --[no-]enabled
        If enabled, the peer connection can be established with routing
        information. If disabled, any active session with the peer is
        terminated and all associated routing information is removed. Enabled
        by default. Use --enabled to enable and --no-enabled to disable.

     --instance=INSTANCE
        Router appliance instance of the BGP peer being added.

     --instance-zone=INSTANCE_ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     --ipv4-nexthop-address=IPV4_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS
        If IPv4 route exchange is enabled for IPv6-based BGP, the IPv4 next hop
        address of the Cloud Router interface for this BGP peer. Ignored
        otherwise. Must be a Google owned link-local IPv4 address in the range
        169.254.0.0/16 and must belong to the same subnet as the interface
        address of the peer router.

     --ipv6-nexthop-address=IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS
        If IPv6 route exchange is enabled for IPv4-based BGP, the IPv6 next hop
        address of the Cloud Router interface for this BGP peer. Ignored
        otherwise. Must be a Google owned global unicast IPv6 address belonging
        to the range 2600:2d00:0:2:0:0:0:0/64 or 2600:2d00:0:3:0:0:0:0/64 and
        must belong to same subnet as the interface address of the peer router.

     --md5-authentication-key=MD5_AUTHENTICATION_KEY
        The MD5 authentication key for this BGP peer. Maximum length is 80
        characters. Can contain only printable ASCII characters.

     --peer-ip-address=PEER_IP_ADDRESS
        The address of the peer router. Must be a link-local IPv4 address in
        the the range 169.254.0.0/16 or an ULA IPv6 address in the range
        fdff:1::/64.

     --peer-ipv4-nexthop-address=PEER_IPV4_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS
        If IPv4 route exchange is enabled for IPv6-based BGP, the IPv4 next hop
        address of the peer router. Ignored otherwise. Must be a Google owned
        link-local IPv4 address in the range 169.254.0.0/16.

     --peer-ipv6-nexthop-address=PEER_IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS
        If IPv6 route exchange is enabled for IPv4-based BGP, the IPv6 next hop
        address of the peer router. Ignored otherwise. Must be a Google owned
        global unicast IPv6 address belonging to the range
        2600:2d00:0:2:0:0:0:0/64 or 2600:2d00:0:3:0:0:0:0/64.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the router to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --set-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
        The list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to dynamically advertise on
        this peer. This list can only be specified in custom advertisement
        mode.

        GROUP must be (only one value is supported):

         ALL_SUBNETS
            Automatically advertise all available subnets. This excludes any
            routes learned for subnets that use VPC Network Peering.

     --set-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE=DESC,...]
        The list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to dynamically
        advertise on this peer. Each IP range can (optionally) be given a text
        description DESC. For example, to advertise a specific range, use
        --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24. To store a description with
        the range, use --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24=my-networks.
        This list can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

     --set-custom-learned-route-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE,...]
        The list of user-defined custom learned route IP address ranges for
        this peer. This list is a comma separated IP address ranges such as
        1.2.3.4,6.7.0.0/16,2001:db8:abcd:12::/64 where each IP address range
        must be a valid CIDR-formatted prefix. If an IP address is provided
        without a subnet mask, it is interpreted as a /32 singular IP address
        range for IPv4, and /128 for IPv6.

     Arguments to configure BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) settings:

       --bfd-min-receive-interval=BFD_MIN_RECEIVE_INTERVAL
          The minimum receive interval between BFD control packets. The default
          is 1000 milliseconds. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
          duration formats.

       --bfd-min-transmit-interval=BFD_MIN_TRANSMIT_INTERVAL
          The minimum transmit interval between BFD control packets. The
          default is 1000 milliseconds. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on duration formats.

       --bfd-multiplier=BFD_MULTIPLIER
          The number of consecutive BFD control packets that must be missed
          before BFD declares that a peer is unavailable.

       --bfd-session-initialization-mode=BFD_SESSION_INITIALIZATION_MODE
          The BFD session initialization mode for this BGP peer. Must be one
          of:

          ACTIVE - The Cloud Router will initiate the BFD session for this BGP
          peer.

          PASSIVE - The Cloud Router will wait for the peer router to initiate
          the BFD session for this BGP peer.

          DISABLED - BFD is disabled for this BGP peer.

          BFD_SESSION_INITIALIZATION_MODE must be one of:

           ACTIVE
              The Cloud Router will initiate the BFD session for this BGP peer.
