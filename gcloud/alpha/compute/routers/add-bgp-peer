DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Add a BGP peer to a Compute Engine router.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the router to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interface=INTERFACE
        The name of the interface for this BGP peer.

     --peer-asn=PEER_ASN
        The BGP autonomous system number (ASN) for this BGP peer. Must be a
        16-bit or 32-bit private ASN as defined in
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6996, for example --asn=64512.

     --peer-name=PEER_NAME
        The name of the new BGP peer being added.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --advertised-route-priority=ADVERTISED_ROUTE_PRIORITY
        The priority of routes advertised to this BGP peer. In the case where
        there is more than one matching route of maximum length, the routes
        with lowest priority value win. 0 <= priority <= 65535. If not
        specified, will use Google-managed priorities.

     --advertisement-mode=MODE
        The new advertisement mode for this peer. MODE must be one of:

         CUSTOM
            Custom (user-configured) BGP advertisements.
         DEFAULT
            Default (Google-managed) BGP advertisements.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --[no-]enable-ipv6
        If IPv6 is enabled, the peer connection can be established with IPv6
        route exchange. If disabled, no IPv6 route exchange is allowed on any
        active session. Disabled by default. Use --enable-ipv6 to enable and
        --no-enable-ipv6 to disable.

     --[no-]enabled
        If enabled, the peer connection can be established with routing
        information. If disabled, any active session with the peer is
        terminated and all associated routing information is removed. Enabled
        by default. Use --enabled to enable and --no-enabled to disable.

     --instance=INSTANCE
        Router appliance instance of the BGP peer being added.

     --instance-zone=INSTANCE_ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     --ipv6-nexthop-address=IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS
        The IPv6 next hop address of the Cloud Router interface for this BGP
        peer. Must be a Google owned global unicast IPv6 address belonging to
        the range 2600:2d00:0:2:0:0:0:0/64 or 2600:2d00:0:3:0:0:0:0/64 and must
        belong to same subnet as the interface address of the peer router.

     --md5-authentication-key=MD5_AUTHENTICATION_KEY
        The MD5 authentication key for this BGP peer. Maximum length is 80
        characters. Can contain only printable ASCII characters.

     --peer-ip-address=PEER_IP_ADDRESS
        The link-local address of the peer router. Must be a link-local IPv4
        address belonging to the range 169.254.0.0/16.

     --peer-ipv6-nexthop-address=PEER_IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS
        The IPv6 next hop address of the peer router. Must be a Google owned
        global unicast IPv6 address belonging to the range
        2600:2d00:0:2:0:0:0:0/64 or 2600:2d00:0:3:0:0:0:0/64.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the router to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --set-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
        The list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to dynamically advertise on
        this peer. This list can only be specified in custom advertisement
        mode.

        GROUP must be (only one value is supported):

         ALL_SUBNETS
            Automatically advertise all available subnets. This excludes any
            routes learned for subnets that use VPC Network Peering.

     --set-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE=DESC,...]
        The list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to dynamically
        advertise on this peer. Each IP range can (optionally) be given a text
        description DESC. For example, to advertise a specific range, use
        --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24. To store a description with
        the range, use --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24=my-networks.
        This list can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

     Arguments to configure BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) settings:

       --bfd-min-receive-interval=BFD_MIN_RECEIVE_INTERVAL
          The minimum receive interval between BFD control packets. The default
          is 1000 milliseconds. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
          duration formats.

       --bfd-min-transmit-interval=BFD_MIN_TRANSMIT_INTERVAL
          The minimum transmit interval between BFD control packets. The
          default is 1000 milliseconds. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on duration formats.

       --bfd-multiplier=BFD_MULTIPLIER
          The number of consecutive BFD control packets that must be missed
          before BFD declares that a peer is unavailable.

       --bfd-session-initialization-mode=BFD_SESSION_INITIALIZATION_MODE
          The BFD session initialization mode for this BGP peer. Must be one
          of:

          ACTIVE - The Cloud Router will initiate the BFD session for this BGP
          peer.

          PASSIVE - The Cloud Router will wait for the peer router to initiate
          the BFD session for this BGP peer.

          DISABLED - BFD is disabled for this BGP peer.

          BFD_SESSION_INITIALIZATION_MODE must be one of:

           ACTIVE
              The Cloud Router will initiate the BFD session for this BGP peer.
           DISABLED
              BFD is disabled for this BGP peer.
           PASSIVE
              The Cloud Router will wait for the peer router to initiate the
              BFD session for this BGP peer.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer

        $ gcloud beta compute routers add-bgp-peer
