NAME
    gcloud alpha compute routers nats rules create - add a Rule to a Compute
        Engine NAT

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute routers nats rules create RULE_NUMBER --match=MATCH
        --nat=NAT --router=ROUTER [--async] [--region=REGION]
        [--source-nat-active-ips=IP_ADDRESS,[IP_ADDRESS,...]]
        [--source-nat-active-ranges=SUBNETWORK,[SUBNETWORK,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute routers nats rules create is used to create a
    Rule on a Compute Engine NAT.

EXAMPLES
    Create a rule to use the IP Address address-1 to talk to destination IPs in
    the CIDR Range "203.0.113.0/24".

        $ gcloud alpha compute routers nats rules create 1 --nat=my-nat \
            --router=my-router --region=us-central1 \
            --match='inIpRange(destination.ip, "203.0.113.0/24")' \
            --source-nat-active-ips=a1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RULE_NUMBER
        Number that uniquely identifies the Rule to create

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --match=MATCH
        CEL Expression used to identify traffic to which this rule applies.

        ◆ Supported attributes (Public NAT): destination.ip
        ◆ Supported attributes (Private NAT): nexthop.hub
        ◆ Supported methods (Public Nat): inIpRange
        ◆ Supported operators (Public NAT): ||, ==
        ◆ Supported operators (Private NAT): ==

        Examples of allowed Match expressions (Public NAT):
        ◆ 'inIpRange(destination.ip, "203.0.113.0/24")''
        ◆ 'destination.ip == "203.0.113.7"'
        ◆ 'destination.ip == "203.0.113.7" || inIpRange(destination.ip,
          "203.0.113.16/25")'

        Example of allowed Match expression (Private NAT):
        ◆ nexthop.hub ==
          "//networkconnectivity.googleapis.com/projects/p1/locations/global/hubs/h1"

     --nat=NAT
        Name of the NAT that contains the Rule

     --router=ROUTER
        The Router to use for NAT.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the NAT to create. If not specified, you might be prompted to
        select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --source-nat-active-ips=IP_ADDRESS,[IP_ADDRESS,...]
        External IP Addresses to use for connections matching this rule. This
        flag is supported only for Public NAT and is required when creating a
        Public NAT gateway.

        These must be valid reserved external IP addresses in the same region.

     --source-nat-active-ranges=SUBNETWORK,[SUBNETWORK,...]
        Subnetworks from which addresses are used for connections matching this
        rule. This flag is supported only for Private NAT and is required when
        creating a Private NAT gateway.

        These must be subnetwork resources in the same region, with purpose set
        to PRIVATE_NAT.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute routers nats rules create

        $ gcloud beta compute routers nats rules create
