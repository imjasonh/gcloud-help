NAME
    gcloud alpha compute future-reservations update - update Compute Engine
        future reservations

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute future-reservations update FUTURE_RESERVATION
        [--start-time=START_TIME] [--total-count=TOTAL_COUNT] [--zone=ZONE]
        [--duration=DURATION | --end-time=END_TIME] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update Compute Engine future reservations.

EXAMPLES
    To update total count, start and end time of a Compute Engine future
    reservation in us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute future-reservations update \
          my-future-reservation --total-count=1000 \
          --start-time=2021-11-10T07:00:00Z \
          --end-time=2021-12-10T07:00:00Z --zone=us-central1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FUTURE_RESERVATION
        Name of the future reservation to update.

FLAGS
     --start-time=START_TIME
        Start time of the Future Reservation. The start time must be an RFC3339
        valid string formatted by date, time, and timezone or
        "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"; where YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day, HH =
        hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = timezone (i.e.
        2021-11-20T07:00:00Z).

     --total-count=TOTAL_COUNT
        The total number of instances for which capacity assurance is requested
        at a future time period.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the future reservation to update. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --duration=DURATION
          Alternate way of specifying time in the number of seconds to
          terminate capacity request relative to the start time of a request.

       --end-time=END_TIME
          End time of the Future Reservation. The end time must be an RFC3339
          valid string formatted by date, time, and timezone or
          "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"; where YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day, HH =
          hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = timezone (i.e.
          2021-11-20T07:00:00Z).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
