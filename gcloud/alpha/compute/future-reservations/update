DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update Compute Engine future reservations.

EXAMPLES
    To update total count, start and end time of a Compute Engine future
    reservation in us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute future-reservations update \
          my-future-reservation --total-count=1000 \
          --start-time=2021-11-10T07:00:00Z \
          --end-time=2021-12-10T07:00:00Z --zone=us-central1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FUTURE_RESERVATION
        Name of the future reservation to update.

FLAGS
     --planning-status=PLANNING_STATUS
        The planning status of the future reservation. The default value is
        DRAFT. While in DRAFT, any changes to the future reservation's
        properties will be allowed. If set to SUBMITTED, the future reservation
        will submit and its procurementStatus will change to PENDING_APPROVAL.
        Once the future reservation is pending approval, changes to the future
        reservation's properties will not be allowed. PLANNING_STATUS must be
        one of:

         DRAFT
            Default planning status value.
         SUBMITTED
            Planning status value to immediately submit the future reservation.

     --total-count=TOTAL_COUNT
        The total number of instances for which capacity assurance is requested
        at a future time period.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the future reservation to update. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Manage the specific SKU reservation properties.

       --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
          Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator cards
          attached.
           count
              The number of accelerators to attach to each instance in the
              reservation.
           type
              The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
              accelerator to attach to instances in the reservation. Use gcloud
              compute accelerator-types list to learn about all available
              accelerator types.

       --local-ssd=[count=COUNT],[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
          Manage the size and the interface of local SSD to use. See
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for more
          information.
           interface
              The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD. Valid
              values are scsi and nvme. SCSI is the default and is supported by
              more guest operating systems. NVME may provide higher
              performance.
           size
              The size of the local SSD in base-2 GB.
           count
              The number of local SSD to use per VM. Default value is 1.

       --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
          The type of machine (name only) that has a fixed number of vCPUs and
          a fixed amount of memory. You can also specify a custom machine type
          by using the pattern custom-number_of_CPUs-amount_of_memory-for
          example, custom-32-29440.

       --maintenance-interval=MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL
          Specifies how infrastructure upgrades should be applied to the VM.
          MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL must be (currently only one value is supported):

           PERIODIC
              VMs receive infrastructure and hypervisor updates on a periodic
              basis, minimizing the number of maintenance operations (live
              migrations or terminations) on an individual VM. Security updates
              will still be applied as soon as they are available.

       --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM
          Optional minimum CPU platform of the reservation to create.

     Manage the time specific properties for requesting future capacity

       --start-time=START_TIME
          Start time of the Future Reservation. The start time must be an
          RFC3339 valid string formatted by date, time, and timezone or
          "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"; where YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day, HH =
          hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = timezone (i.e.
          2021-11-20T07:00:00Z).

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --duration=DURATION
            Alternate way of specifying time in the number of seconds to
            terminate capacity request relative to the start time of a request.

         --end-time=END_TIME
            End time of the Future Reservation. The end time must be an RFC3339
            valid string formatted by date, time, and timezone or
            "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"; where YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day, HH
            = hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = timezone (i.e.
            2021-11-20T07:00:00Z).

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
