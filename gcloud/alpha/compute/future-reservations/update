DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update Compute Engine future reservations.

EXAMPLES
    To update total count, start and end time of a Compute Engine future
    reservation in us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute future-reservations update \
          my-future-reservation --total-count=1000 \
          --start-time=2021-11-10T07:00:00Z \
          --end-time=2021-12-10T07:00:00Z --zone=us-central1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FUTURE_RESERVATION
        Name of the future reservation to update.

FLAGS
     --[no-]auto-delete-auto-created-reservations
        If specified, the auto-created reservations for a future reservation
        are deleted at the end time (default) or at a specified delete time.
        Use --auto-delete-auto-created-reservations to enable and
        --no-auto-delete-auto-created-reservations to disable.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description of the future reservation to create.

     --planning-status=PLANNING_STATUS
        The planning status of the future reservation. The default value is
        DRAFT. While in DRAFT, any changes to the future reservation's
        properties will be allowed. If set to SUBMITTED, the future reservation
        will submit and its procurementStatus will change to PENDING_APPROVAL.
        Once the future reservation is pending approval, changes to the future
        reservation's properties will not be allowed. PLANNING_STATUS must be
        one of:

         DRAFT
            Default planning status value.
         SUBMITTED
            Planning status value to immediately submit the future reservation.

     --[no-]require-specific-reservation
        Indicate whether the auto-created reservations can be consumed by VMs
        with "any reservation" defined. If enabled, then only VMs that target
        the auto-created reservation by name using
        --reservation-affinity=specific can consume from this reservation.
        Auto-created reservations delivered with this flag enabled will inherit
        the name of the future reservation. Use --require-specific-reservation
        to enable and --no-require-specific-reservation to disable.

     --total-count=TOTAL_COUNT
        The total number of instances for which capacity assurance is requested
        at a future time period.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the future reservation to update. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Manage the auto-delete time properties.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --auto-created-reservations-delete-time=AUTO_CREATED_RESERVATIONS_DELETE_TIME
          Automatically deletes an auto-created reservations at a specific
          time. The specified time must be an RFC3339 timestamp, which must be
          formatted as "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" where YYYY = year, MM = month, DD
          = day, HH = hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = time zone in
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, specify
          2021-11-20T07:00:00Z.

       --auto-created-reservations-duration=AUTO_CREATED_RESERVATIONS_DURATION
          Automatically deletes an auto-created reservations after a specified
          number of days, hours, minutes, or seconds. For example, specify 30m
          for 30 minutes, or 1d2h3m4s for 1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4
          seconds. For more information, see $ gcloud topic datetimes.

     Manage the name-prefix of a future reservation.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-name-prefix
          Clears the name prefix for the system generated reservations.

       --name-prefix=NAME_PREFIX
          A name prefix for the auto-created reservations when capacity is
          delivered at the start time. Each auto-created reservation name
          starts with the name prefix.

     Manage the properties of a shared future reservation.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-share-settings
          Clear share settings on future reservation. This will result in
          non-shared future reservation.

       Manage the share settings of a future reservation.

         --share-setting=SHARE_SETTING
            Specify if this future reservation is shared, and if so, the type
            of sharing. If you omit this flag, this value is local by default.
            SHARE_SETTING must be one of: local, projects.

         --share-with=PROJECT,[PROJECT,...]
            If this future reservation is shared, provide a comma-separated
            list of projects that this future reservation is shared with. The
            list must contain project IDs or project numbers.

     Manage the specific SKU reservation properties.

       --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
          The type of machine (name only) that has a fixed number of vCPUs and
          a fixed amount of memory. You can also specify a custom machine type
          by using the pattern custom-number_of_CPUs-amount_of_memory-for
          example, custom-32-29440.

       --maintenance-interval=MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL
          Specifies how infrastructure upgrades should be applied to the VM.
          MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL must be one of:

           PERIODIC
              VMs receive infrastructure and hypervisor updates on a periodic
              basis, minimizing the number of maintenance operations (live
              migrations or terminations) on an individual VM. Security updates
              will still be applied as soon as they are available.
           RECURRENT
              VMs receive infrastructure and hypervisor updates on a periodic
              basis, minimizing the number of maintenance operations (live
              migrations or terminations) on an individual VM. This may mean a
              VM will take longer to receive an update than if it was
              configured for AS_NEEDED. Security updates will still be applied
              as soonas they are available. RECURRENT is used for GEN3 and
              Sliceof Hardware VMs.

       --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM
          Optional minimum CPU platform of the reservation to create.

       Manage the accelerators of a future reservation.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
            Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator
            cards attached.
             count
                The number of accelerators to attach to each instance in the
                reservation.
             type
                The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80)
                of accelerator to attach to instances in the reservation. Use
                gcloud compute accelerator-types list to learn about all
                available accelerator types.

         --clear-accelerator
            Remove all accelerators from the future reservation.

       Manage the local ssd of a future reservation.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --clear-local-ssd
            Remove all local ssd information on the future reservation.

         --local-ssd=[count=COUNT],[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
            Manage the size and the interface of local SSD to use. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for more
            information.
             interface
                The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD.
                Valid values are scsi and nvme. SCSI is the default and is
                supported by more guest operating systems. NVME may provide
                higher performance.
             size
                The size of the local SSD in base-2 GB.
             count
                The number of local SSD to use per VM. Default value is 1.

     Manage the time specific properties for requesting future capacity

       --start-time=START_TIME
          Start time of the Future Reservation. The start time must be an
          RFC3339 valid string formatted by date, time, and timezone or
          "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"; where YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day, HH =
          hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = timezone (i.e.
          2021-11-20T07:00:00Z).

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --duration=DURATION
            Alternate way of specifying time in the number of seconds to
            terminate capacity request relative to the start time of a request.

         --end-time=END_TIME
            End time of the Future Reservation. The end time must be an RFC3339
            valid string formatted by date, time, and timezone or
            "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"; where YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day, HH
            = hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = timezone (i.e.
            2021-11-20T07:00:00Z).
