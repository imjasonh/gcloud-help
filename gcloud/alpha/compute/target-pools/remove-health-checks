NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-pools remove-health-checks - remove an HTTP
        health check from a target pool

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-pools remove-health-checks NAME
        --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-pools remove-health-checks is used to
    remove an HTTP health check from a target pool. Health checks are used to
    determine the health status of instances in the target pool. For more
    information on health checks and load balancing, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the target pool from which to remove the health check.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
        Specifies an HTTP health check object to remove from the target pool.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the target pool to remove health checks from. If not
        specified, you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode
        only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute target-pools remove-health-checks

        $ gcloud beta compute target-pools remove-health-checks
