NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-pools create - define a load-balanced pool of
        virtual machine instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-pools create NAME [--backup-pool=BACKUP_POOL]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--failover-ratio=FAILOVER_RATIO]
        [--health-check=HEALTH_CHECK] [--http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK]
        [--region=REGION] [--session-affinity=SESSION_AFFINITY; default="NONE"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-pools create is used to create a target
    pool. A target pool resource defines a group of instances that can receive
    incoming traffic from forwarding rules. When a forwarding rule directs
    traffic to a target pool, Compute Engine picks an instance from the target
    pool based on a hash of the source and destination IP addresses and ports.
    For more information on load balancing, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/

    To add instances to a target pool, use 'gcloud compute target-pools
    add-instances'.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the target pool.

FLAGS
     --backup-pool=BACKUP_POOL
        Together with --failover-ratio, this flag defines the fallback behavior
        of the target pool (primary pool) to be created by this command. If the
        ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below the
        specified --failover-ratio value, then traffic arriving at the
        load-balanced IP address will be directed to the backup pool. If this
        flag is provided, then --failover-ratio is required.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description of this target pool.

     --failover-ratio=FAILOVER_RATIO
        Together with --backup-pool, defines the fallback behavior of the
        target pool (primary pool) to be created by this command. If the ratio
        of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below this
        number, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP address will be
        directed to the backup pool. For example, if 0.4 is chosen as the
        failover ratio, then traffic will fail over to the backup pool if more
        than 40% of the instances become unhealthy. If not set, the traffic
        will be directed the instances in this pool in the force mode, where
        traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort,
        or to all instances when no instance is healthy. If this flag is
        provided, then --backup-pool is required.

     --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
        DEPRECATED, use --http-health-check. Specifies an HTTP health check
        resource to use to determine the health of instances in this pool. If
        no health check is specified, traffic will be sent to all instances in
        this target pool as if the instances were healthy, but the health
        status of this pool will appear as unhealthy as a warning that this
        target pool does not have a health check.

     --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
        Specifies an HTTP health check resource to use to determine the health
        of instances in this pool. If no health check is specified, traffic
        will be sent to all instances in this target pool as if the instances
        were healthy, but the health status of this pool will appear as
        unhealthy as a warning that this target pool does not have a health
        check.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the target pool to create. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --session-affinity=SESSION_AFFINITY; default="NONE"
        The type of session affinity to use. Supports both TCP and UDP.
        SESSION_AFFINITY must be one of:

         CLIENT_IP
            Route requests to instances based on the hash of the client's IP
            address.
         CLIENT_IP_PROTO
            Connections from the same client IP with the same IP protocol will
            go to the same VM in the pool while that VM remains healthy.
         NONE
            Session affinity is disabled.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute target-pools create

        $ gcloud beta compute target-pools create
