NAME
    gcloud alpha compute url-maps delete - delete URL maps

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute url-maps delete URL_MAP [URL_MAP ...]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute url-maps delete deletes one or more URL maps.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL_MAP [URL_MAP ...]
        Names of the URL maps to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the URL maps are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the URL maps to delete. If not specified, you might be
          prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute url-maps delete

        $ gcloud beta compute url-maps delete
