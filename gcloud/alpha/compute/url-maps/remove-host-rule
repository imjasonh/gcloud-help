NAME
    gcloud alpha compute url-maps remove-host-rule - remove a host rule from a
        URL map

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute url-maps remove-host-rule URL_MAP --host=HOST
        [--delete-orphaned-path-matcher] [--global | --region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute url-maps remove-host-rule is used to remove a
    host rule from a URL map. When a host rule is removed, its path matcher is
    only removed if it is not referenced by any other host rules and
    --delete-orphaned-path-matcher is provided.

EXAMPLES
    To remove a host rule that contains the host example.com from the URL map
    named MY-URL-MAP, you can use this command:

        $ gcloud alpha compute url-maps remove-host-rule MY-URL-MAP \
            --host=example.com

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL_MAP
        Name of the URL map to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --host=HOST
        One of the hosts in the host rule to remove.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --delete-orphaned-path-matcher
        If provided and a path matcher is orphaned as a result of this command,
        the command removes the orphaned path matcher instead of failing.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the URL map is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the URL map to operate on. If not specified, you might be
          prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute url-maps remove-host-rule

        $ gcloud beta compute url-maps remove-host-rule
