    gcloud alpha compute resource-policies update snapshot-schedule - update a
        Compute Engine Snapshot Schedule Resource Policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute resource-policies update snapshot-schedule NAME
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--max-retention-days=MAX_RETENTION_DAYS]
        [--on-source-disk-delete=ON_SOURCE_DISK_DELETE] [--region=REGION]
        [--snapshot-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--weekly-schedule-from-file=WEEKLY_CYCLE_FROM_FILE

          | --weekly-schedule=WEEKLY_CYCLE)] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a Compute Engine Snapshot Schedule Resource Policy.

EXAMPLES
    The following command updates a Compute Engine Snapshot Schedule Resource
    Policy to take a daily snapshot at 13:00 UTC

        $ gcloud alpha compute resource-policies update snapshot-schedule \
            my-resource-policy --region=REGION --start-time=13:00 \
            --daily-schedule

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the resource policy to operate on.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the backend.

     --max-retention-days=MAX_RETENTION_DAYS
        Maximum number of days snapshot can be retained.

     --on-source-disk-delete=ON_SOURCE_DISK_DELETE
        Retention behavior of automatic snapshots in the event of source disk
        deletion. ON_SOURCE_DISK_DELETE must be one of:

         apply-retention-policy
            Continue to apply the retention window to automatically-created
            snapshots when the source disk is deleted.
         keep-auto-snapshots
            Keep automatically-created snapshots when the source disk is
            deleted. This is the default behavior.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the resource policy to operate on. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --snapshot-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

        The label is added to each snapshot created by the schedule.

     Cycle Frequency Group.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       Using a file:

         --weekly-schedule-from-file=WEEKLY_CYCLE_FROM_FILE
            A JSON/YAML file which specifies a weekly schedule. The file should
            contain the following fields:

            day: Day of the week with the same choices as --weekly-schedule.
            startTime: Start time of the snapshot schedule with the same format
            as --start-time.

            For more information about using a file, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots#create_snapshot_schedule

       Using command flags:

         --start-time=START_TIME
            Start time for the disk snapshot schedule in UTC. For example,
            --start-time="15:00".

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         Exactly one of these must be specified:

           --daily-schedule
              Snapshot schedule starts daily at START_TIME.

           --hourly-schedule=HOURS
              Snapshot schedule occurs every n hours starting at START_TIME.

           --weekly-schedule=WEEKLY_CYCLE
              Snapshot schedule occurs weekly on WEEKLY_SCHEDULE at START_TIME.
              WEEKLY_CYCLE must be one of: monday, tuesday, wednesday,
              thursday, friday, saturday, sunday.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute resource-policies update snapshot-schedule

        $ gcloud beta compute resource-policies update snapshot-schedule
