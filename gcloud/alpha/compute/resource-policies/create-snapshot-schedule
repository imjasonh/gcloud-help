        (--weekly-schedule-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) create-snapshot-schedule is deprecated. Use compute
    resource-policies create snapshot-schedule instead.

    Create a Compute Engine Snapshot Schedule Resource Policy.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a Compute Engine Snapshot Schedule Resource
    Policy with a daily snapshot and a one day snapshot retention policy.

        $ gcloud alpha compute resource-policies create-snapshot-schedule \
            my-resource-policy --region=REGION --start-time=04:00Z \
            --daily-schedule --max-retention-days=1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the resource policy to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --max-retention-days=MAX_RETENTION_DAYS
        Maximum number of days snapshot can be retained.

     Cycle Frequency Group.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       Using a file:

       --weekly-schedule-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          A JSON/YAML file which specifies a weekly schedule. The file should
          contain the following fields:

          day: Day of the week with the same choices as --weekly-schedule.
          startTime: Start time of the snapshot schedule with the same format
          as --start-time.

          For more information about using a file, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots#create_snapshot_schedule.

          Use a full or relative path to a local file containing the value of
          weekly_schedule.

       Using command flags:

       --start-time=START_TIME
          Start time for the disk snapshot schedule. See $ gcloud topic
          datetimes for information on time formats.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       Exactly one of these must be specified:

         --daily-schedule
            Snapshot schedule starts daily at START_TIME.

         --hourly-schedule=HOURS
            Snapshot schedule occurs every n hours starting at START_TIME.

         --weekly-schedule=WEEKLY_CYCLE
            Snapshot schedule occurs weekly on WEEKLY_SCHEDULE at START_TIME.
            WEEKLY_CYCLE must be one of: monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday,
            friday, saturday, sunday.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the backend.

     --on-source-disk-delete=ON_SOURCE_DISK_DELETE
        Retention behavior of automatic snapshots in the event of source disk
        deletion. ON_SOURCE_DISK_DELETE must be one of:

         apply-retention-policy
            Continue to apply the retention window to automatically-created
            snapshots when the source disk is deleted.
         keep-auto-snapshots
            Keep automatically-created snapshots when the source disk is
            deleted. This is the default behavior.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the resource policy to operate on. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     Snapshot properties

     --guest-flush
        Create an application consistent snapshot by informing the OS to
        prepare for the snapshot process.

     --snapshot-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

        The label is added to each snapshot created by the schedule.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --snapshot-region=SNAPSHOT_REGION
          Region where the snapshot is scoped to.

       --storage-location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud Storage location, either regional or multi-regional,
          where snapshot content is to be stored. If absent, a nearby regional
          or multi-regional location is chosen automatically.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute resource-policies create-snapshot-schedule
