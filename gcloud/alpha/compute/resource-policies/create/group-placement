    gcloud alpha compute resource-policies create group-placement - create a
        Compute Engine group placement resource policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute resource-policies create group-placement NAME
        [--availability-domain-count=AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_COUNT]
        [--collocation=COLLOCATION] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--gpu-topology=GPU_TOPOLOGY] [--max-distance=MAX_DISTANCE]

        [--vm-count=VM_COUNT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a Compute Engine Group Placement Resource Policy.

EXAMPLES
    To create a Compute Engine group placement policy with two availability
    domains, run:        $ gcloud alpha compute resource-policies create group-placement \
            my-resource-policy --region=REGION --availability-domain-count=2

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the resource policy to operate on.

FLAGS
     --availability-domain-count=AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_COUNT
        Number of availability domain in the group placement policy.

     --collocation=COLLOCATION
        Collocation specifies whether to place VMs inside the sameavailability
        domain on the same low-latency network. COLLOCATION must be one of:

         clustered
            Lowest network latency between VMs placed on the same availability
            domain.
         collocated
            Low network latency between more VMs placed on the same
            availability domain.
         unspecified-collocation
            Unspecified network latency between VMs placed on the same
            availability domain. This is the default behavior.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the backend.

     --gpu-topology=GPU_TOPOLOGY
        Specifies the shape of the GPU slice, in slice based GPU families eg.
        A4X.

     --max-distance=MAX_DISTANCE
        Specifies the number of max logical switches between VMs.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the resource policy to operate on. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --scope=SCOPE
        Scope specifies the availability domain to which the VMs should be
        spread. SCOPE must be one of:

         host
            Specifies availability domain scope across hosts. Instances will be
            spread across different hosts.
         unspecified-scope
            Instances will be spread across different instrastructure to not
            share power, host and networking.

     --tpu-topology=TPU_TOPOLOGY
        Specifies the shape of the TPU pod slice.

     --vm-count=VM_COUNT
        Number of instances targeted by the group placement policy. Google does
        not recommend that you use this flag unless you use a compact policy
        and you want your policy to work only if it contains this exact number
        of VMs.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute resource-policies create group-placement

        $ gcloud beta compute resource-policies create group-placement
