SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute reservations blocks perform-maintenance RESERVATION
        --block-name=BLOCK_NAME [--scope=SCOPE] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Perform maintenance on a reservation block.

EXAMPLES
    To perform maintenance on a reservation block in reservation exr1 in
    my-zone with block name block1 with scope all, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute reservations blocks perform-maintenance \
            exr1 --zone=my-zone --block-name=block1 --scope=all

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RESERVATION
        Name of the reservation to perform-maintenance.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --block-name=BLOCK_NAME
        The name of the reservation block.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --scope=SCOPE
        The maintenance scope to set for the reservation block. SCOPE must be
        one of:

         all
            Maintenance should be performed on all hosts in the reservation
            block.
         running
            Maintenance should be performed only on the hosts in the
            reservation block which have running VMs.
         unused
            Maintenance should be performed only on the hosts in the
            reservation block which have no running VMs.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the reservation to perform-maintenance. If not specified and
        the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
        zone (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
