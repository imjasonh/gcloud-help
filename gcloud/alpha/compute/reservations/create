DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a Compute Engine reservation.

EXAMPLES
    To create a Compute Engine reservation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute reservations create my-reservation \
          --zone=fake-zone --vm-count=1 --machine-type=n1-standard-1 \
          --min-cpu-platform="Intel Haswell"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RESERVATION
        Name of the reservation to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Manage the specific SKU reservation properties.

     This must be specified.

       --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
          The type of machine (name only) which has a fixed number of vCPUs and
          a fixed amount of memory. This also includes specifying custom
          machine type following custom-number_of_CPUs-amount_of_memory
          pattern, e.g. custom-32-29440.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --vm-count=VM_COUNT
          The number of VM instances that are allocated to this reservation.
          The value of this field must be an int in the range [1, 1000].

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
          Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator cards
          attached.
           count
              The number of accelerators to attach to each instance in the
              reservation.
           type
              The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
              accelerator to attach to instances in the reservation. Use gcloud
              compute accelerator-types list to learn about all available
              accelerator types.

       --local-ssd=[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
          Manage the size and the interface of local SSD to use. See
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for more
          information.
           interface
              The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD. Valid
              values are scsi and nvme. SCSI is the default and is supported by
              more guest operating systems. NVME may provide higher
              performance.
           size
              The size of the local SSD in base-2 GB.

       --maintenance-freeze-duration=MAINTENANCE_FREEZE_DURATION
          Specifies the amount of hours after instance creation where the
          instance won't be scheduled for maintenance, e.g. 4h, 2d6h. See $
          gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

       --maintenance-interval=MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL
          Specifies how infrastructure upgrades should be applied to the VM.
          MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL must be (currently only one value is supported):

           PERIODIC
              VMs receive infrastructure and hypervisor updates on a periodic
              basis, minimizing the number of maintenance operations (live
              migrations or terminations) on an individual VM. Security updates
              will still be applied as soon as they are available.

       --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM
          Optional minimum CPU platform of the reservation to create.

       --require-specific-reservation
          Indicates whether the reservation can be consumed by VMs with "any
          reservation" defined. If enabled, then only VMs that target this
          reservation by name using --reservation-affinity=specific can consume
          from this reservation.

       --resource-policies=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Specify if this is reservation with resource policy. If you omit this
          flag, no resource policy will be added to this reservation.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description of the reservation to create.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the reservation to create. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Manage the properties of a shared reservation.

       --share-setting=SHARE_SETTING
          Specify if this reservation is shared, and if so, the type of
          sharing. If you omit this flag, this value is local (not shared) by
          default. SHARE_SETTING must be one of: local, projects, folders.

       --share-with=SHARE_WITH,[SHARE_WITH,...]
          If this reservation is shared (--share-setting is not local), provide
          a list of all of the specific projects or folders that this
          reservation is shared with. List must contain project IDs or project
          numbers or folder IDs.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute reservations create

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations create
