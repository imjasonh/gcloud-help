NAME
    gcloud alpha compute reservations remove-iam-policy-binding - remove IAM
        policy binding from a Compute Engine reservation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute reservations remove-iam-policy-binding
        (RESERVATION : --zone=ZONE) --member=PRINCIPAL --role=ROLE
        [--all | --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Remove an IAM policy binding from the IAM policy of a Compute
    Engine reservation. One binding consists of a member, a role, and an
    optional condition.

EXAMPLES
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of
    'roles/compute.securityAdmin' for the user 'test-user@gmail.com' with
    reservation 'my-reservation' and zone 'ZONE', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute reservations remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my-reservation --zone=ZONE --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.securityAdmin'

    To remove an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018
    for the role of 'roles/compute.securityAdmin' and the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' with reservation 'my-reservation' and zone 'ZONE',
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute reservations remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my-reservation --zone=ZONE --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.securityAdmin' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Reservation resource - The reservation for which to remove IAM policy
     binding from. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument reservation on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       RESERVATION
          ID of the reservation or fully qualified identifier for the
          reservation. To set the reservation attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument reservation on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --zone=ZONE
          The name of the Google Compute Engine zone. To set the zone
          attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument reservation on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --zone on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/zone.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Deleted principals have an additional deleted: prefix and a ?uid=UID
        suffix, where UID is a unique identifier for the principal. Example:
        deleted:user:test-user@gmail.com?uid=123456789012345678901.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the principal from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and principal, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding that you want to remove. When the
          condition is explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a
          binding without a condition is removed. Otherwise, only a binding
          with a condition that exactly matches the specified condition
          (including the optional description) is removed. For more on
          conditions, refer to the conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the compute/alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/compute/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute reservations remove-iam-policy-binding

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations remove-iam-policy-binding
