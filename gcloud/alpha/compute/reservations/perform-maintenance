NAME
    gcloud alpha compute reservations perform-maintenance - perform maintenance
        on a reservation, only applicable to reservations with reservation
        blocks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute reservations perform-maintenance RESERVATION
        [--scope=SCOPE] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Perform maintenance on a reservation, only applicable to
    reservations with reservation blocks.

EXAMPLES
    To perform maintenance on reservation exr1 in my-zone with scope all, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute reservations perform-maintenance exr1 \
            --zone=my-zone --scope=all

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RESERVATION
        Name of the reservation to perform-maintenance.

FLAGS
     --scope=SCOPE
        The maintenance scope to set for the reservation. SCOPE must be one of:

         all
            Perform maintenance on all hosts in the reservation.
         running
            Perform maintenance only on the hosts in the reservation that have
            running VMs.
         unused
            Perform maintenance only on the hosts in the reservation that don't
            have running VMs.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the reservation to perform-maintenance. If not specified and
        the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
        zone (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations perform-maintenance
