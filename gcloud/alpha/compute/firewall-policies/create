DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute firewall-policies create is used to create
    organization firewall policies. An organization firewall policy is a set of
    rules that controls access to various resources.

EXAMPLES
    To create an organization firewall policy under folder with ID
    ``123456789", run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute firewall-policies create \
            --short-name=my-policy --folder=123456789

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --short-name=SHORT_NAME
        A textual name of the firewall policy. The name must be 1-63 characters
        long, and comply with RFC 1035.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          Folder in which the organization firewall policy is to be created.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Organization in which the organization firewall policy is to be
          created.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the organization security policy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute firewall-policies create

        $ gcloud beta compute firewall-policies create
