DESCRIPTION

        $ gcloud alpha compute firewall-policies delete 123456789

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FIREWALL_POLICY
        Short name or ID of the firewall policy to delete.

FLAGS
     --organization=ORGANIZATION
        Organization in which the organization firewall policy is to be
        deleted. Must be set if FIREWALL_POLICY is the short name.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

IAM PERMISSIONS
    To delete a firewall policy, the user must have the following permission:
    compute.firewallPolicies.delete.

    To find predefined roles that contain those permissions, see the Compute
    Engine IAM roles (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam).

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute firewall-policies delete

        $ gcloud beta compute firewall-policies delete
