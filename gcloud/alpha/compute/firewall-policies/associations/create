NAME
    gcloud alpha compute firewall-policies associations create - create a new
        association between a firewall policy and an organization or folder
        resource

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute firewall-policies associations create
        --firewall-policy=FIREWALL_POLICY [--folder=FOLDER] [--name=NAME]
        [--organization=ORGANIZATION] [--replace-association-on-target]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute firewall-policies associations create is used
    to create organization firewall policy associations. An organization
    firewall policy is a set of rules that controls access to various
    resources.

EXAMPLES
    To associate an organization firewall policy under folder with ID
    ``123456789" to folder ``987654321", run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute firewall-policies associations create \
            --firewall-policy=123456789 --folder=987654321

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --firewall-policy=FIREWALL_POLICY
        Security policy ID of the association.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --folder=FOLDER
        ID of the folder with which the association is created.

     --name=NAME
        Name to identify this association. If unspecified, the name will be set
        to "organization-{ORGANIZATION_ID}" or "folder-{FOLDER_ID}".

     --organization=ORGANIZATION
        ID of the organization in which the firewall policy is to be
        associated. Must be set if FIREWALL_POLICY is short name.

     --replace-association-on-target
        By default, if you attempt to insert an association to an organization
        or folder resource that is already associated with a firewall policy
        the method will fail. If this is set, the existing association will be
        deleted at the same time that the new association is created.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute firewall-policies associations create

        $ gcloud beta compute firewall-policies associations create
