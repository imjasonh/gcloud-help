IAM PERMISSIONS
    To start rollout of a firewall policy, the user must have the following
    permission: compute.firewallPolicies.update, compute.firewallPolicies.use',
    *'compute.organizations.setFirewallPolicy'.

    To find predefined roles that contain those permissions, see the Compute
    Engine IAM roles (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam).

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
