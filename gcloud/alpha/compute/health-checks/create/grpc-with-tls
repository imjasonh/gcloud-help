DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute health-checks create grpc-with-tls is used to
    create a non-legacy health check using the gRPC with TLS protocol. You can
    use this health check for Google Cloud load balancers or for managed
    instance group autohealing. For more information, see the health checks
    overview at:
    https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-check-concepts

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the gRPC with TLS health check to create.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value
        is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional string description for the gRPC with TLS health check.

     --enable-logging
        Enable logging of health check probe results to Stackdriver. Logging is
        disabled by default.

        Use --no-enable-logging to disable logging.

     --grpc-service-name=GRPC_SERVICE_NAME
        An optional gRPC service name string of up to 1024 characters to
        include in the gRPC health check request. Only ASCII characters are
        allowed.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. The default value is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the gRPC with TLS health check is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the gRPC with TLS health check to create. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     These flags configure the port that the health check monitors.

       --port=PORT
          The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

       --use-serving-port
          If given, use the "serving port" for health checks:

          ▸ When health checking network endpoints in a Network Endpoint
            Group, use the port specified with each endpoint.
            --use-serving-port must be used when using a Network Endpoint Group
            as a backend as this flag specifies the portSpecification option
            for a Health Check object.
          ▸ When health checking other backends, use the port of the backend
            service.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
