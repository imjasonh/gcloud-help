DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute security-policies rules
    add-preconfig-waf-exclusion is used to add an exclusion configuration for
    preconfigured WAF evaluation into a security policy rule.

    Note that request field exclusions are associated with a target, which can
    be a single rule set, or a rule set plus a list of rule IDs under the rule
    set.

EXAMPLES
    To add specific request field exclusions that are associated with the
    target of 'sqli-stable': ['owasp-crs-v030001-id942110-sqli',
    'owasp-crs-v030001-id942120-sqli'], run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute security-policies rules \
            add-preconfig-waf-exclusion 1000 --security-policy=my-policy \
            --target-rule-set=sqli-stable \
            --target-rule-ids=owasp-crs-v030001-id942110-sqli,\
        owasp-crs-v030001-id942120-sqli \
            --request-header-to-exclude=op=EQUALS,val=abc \
            --request-header-to-exclude=op=STARTS_WITH,val=xyz \
            --request-uri-to-exclude=op=EQUALS_ANY

    To add specific request field exclusions that are associated with the
    target of 'sqli-stable': [], run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute security-policies rules \
            add-preconfig-waf-exclusion 1000 --security-policy=my-policy \
            --target-rule-set=sqli-stable \
            --request-cookie-to-exclude=op=EQUALS_ANY

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PRIORITY
        The priority of the rule to add the exclusion configuration for
        preconfigured WAF evaluation. Rules are evaluated in order from highest
        priority to lowest priority where 0 is the highest priority and
        2147483647 is the lowest priority.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --target-rule-set=TARGET_RULE_SET
        Target WAF rule set where the request field exclusions being added
        would apply.

        This, together with the target rule IDs (if given), determines the
        target for associating request field exclusions. See --target-rule-ids.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --request-cookie-to-exclude=[op=OP],[val=VAL]
        Adds a request cookie to the request field exclusions associated with
        the rule set and rule IDs (if given). This specifies a request cookie
        whose value will be excluded from inspection during preconfigured WAF
        evaluation.

        You can specify an exact match or a partial match by using a field
        operator and a field value. Available field operators are:
        ◆ EQUALS: the operator matches if the field value equals the
          specified value.
        ◆ STARTS_WITH: the operator matches if the field value starts with
          the specified value.
        ◆ ENDS_WITH: the operator matches if the field value ends with the
          specified value.
        ◆ CONTAINS: the operator matches if the field value contains the
          specified value.
        ◆ EQUALS_ANY: the operator matches if the field value is any value.

        A field value must be given if the field operator is not EQUALS_ANY,
        and cannot be given if the field operator is EQUALS_ANY. For example,
        --request-header-to-exclude op=EQUALS,val=abc or
        --request-header-to-exclude op=EQUALS_ANY.

        This flag can be repeated to specify multiple request headers to
        exclude. For example, --request-header-to-exclude op=EQUALS,val=abc
        --request-header-to-exclude op=STARTS_WITH,val=xyz.

     --request-header-to-exclude=[op=OP],[val=VAL]
        Adds a request header to the request field exclusions associated with
        the rule set and rule IDs (if given). This specifies a request header
        whose value will be excluded from inspection during preconfigured WAF
        evaluation.

        Refer to the syntax under --request-cookie-to-exclude.

        This flag can be repeated to specify multiple request headers.

     --request-query-param-to-exclude=[op=OP],[val=VAL]
        Adds a request query parameter to the request field exclusions
        associated with the rule set and rule IDs (if given). This specifies a
        request query parameter in the query string or in the POST body whose
        value will be excluded from inspection during preconfigured WAF
        evaluation.

        Refer to the syntax under --request-cookie-to-exclude.

        This flag can be repeated to specify multiple request query parameters.

     --request-uri-to-exclude=[op=OP],[val=VAL]
        Adds a request URI to the request field exclusions associated with the
        rule set and rule IDs (if given). This specifies a request URI from the
        request line to be excluded from inspection during preconfigured WAF
        evaluation.

        Refer to the syntax under --request-cookie-to-exclude.

        This flag can be repeated to specify multiple request URIs.

     --security-policy=SECURITY_POLICY
        The security policy that this rule belongs to.

     --target-rule-ids=[RULE_ID,...]
        A comma-separated list of target rule IDs under the WAF rule set where
        the request field exclusions being added would apply. If omitted, the
        added request field exclusions will be associated with the rule set
        only, which would apply to all the rule IDs under the rule set.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:
