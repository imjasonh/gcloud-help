DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules set-target is used to set a
    new target for a forwarding rule. A forwarding rule directs traffic that
    matches a destination IP address (and possibly a TCP or UDP port) to a
    forwarding target (load balancer, VPN gateway or VM instance).

    Forwarding rules can be either global or regional, specified with the
    --global or --region=REGION flags. For more information about the scope of
    a forwarding rule, refer to
    https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts.

    Forwarding rules can be external, internal, internal managed, or internal
    self-managed, specified with the
    --load-balancing-scheme=[EXTERNAL|EXTERNAL_MANAGED|INTERNAL|INTERNAL_MANAGED|INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED]
    flag. External forwarding rules are accessible from the internet, while
    internal forwarding rules are only accessible from within their VPC
    networks. You can specify a reserved static external or internal IP address
    with the --address=ADDRESS flag for the forwarding rule. Otherwise, if the
    flag is unspecified, an ephemeral IP address is automatically assigned
    (global IP addresses for global forwarding rules and regional IP addresses
    for regional forwarding rules); an internal forwarding rule is
    automatically assigned an ephemeral internal IP address from the subnet
    specified with the --subnet flag. You must provide an IP address for an
    internal self-managed forwarding rule.

    Different types of load balancers work at different layers of the OSI
    networking model (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer). Layer 3/4
    targets include target pools, target SSL proxies, target TCP proxies, and
    backend services. Layer 7 targets include target HTTP proxies and target
    HTTPS proxies. For more information, refer to
    https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts.

        When creating a forwarding rule, exactly one of  `_--target-instance_`,
        `_--target-pool_`, `_--target-http-proxy_`, `_--target-https-proxy_`,
        `_--target-grpc-proxy_`, `_--target-ssl-proxy_`,
        `_--target-tcp-proxy_` or `_--target-vpn-gateway_`
        must be specified.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the forwarding rule to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE
          Target backend service that receives the traffic.

       --target-grpc-proxy=TARGET_GRPC_PROXY
          Target gRPC proxy that receives the traffic.

       --target-http-proxy=TARGET_HTTP_PROXY
          Target HTTP proxy that receives the traffic. Acceptable values for
          --ports flag are: 80, 8080.

       --target-https-proxy=TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY
          Target HTTPS proxy that receives the traffic. Acceptable values for
          --ports flag are: 443.

       --target-instance=TARGET_INSTANCE
          Name of the target instance that receives the traffic. The target
          instance must be in a zone in the forwarding rule's region. Global
          forwarding rules cannot direct traffic to target instances. If not
          specified and the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be
          prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

       --target-pool=TARGET_POOL
          Target pool that receives the traffic. The target pool must be in the
          same region as the forwarding rule. Global forwarding rules cannot
          direct traffic to target pools.

       --target-ssl-proxy=TARGET_SSL_PROXY
          Target SSL proxy that receives the traffic. For the acceptable ports,
          see Port specifications
          (https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications).

       --target-tcp-proxy=TARGET_TCP_PROXY
          Target TCP proxy that receives the traffic. For the acceptable ports,
          see Port specifications
          (https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications).

       --target-vpn-gateway=TARGET_VPN_GATEWAY
          Target VPN gateway (Cloud VPN Classic gateway) that receives
          forwarded traffic. Acceptable values for --ports flag are: 500, 4500.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --load-balancing-scheme=LOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME; default="EXTERNAL"
        (DEPRECATED) This defines the forwarding rule's load balancing scheme.

        The --load-balancing-scheme option is deprecated and will be removed in
        an upcoming release. If you're currently using this argument, you
        should remove it from your workflows. LOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME must be one
        of:

         EXTERNAL

            --target-https-proxy, --target-tcp-proxy, --target-ssl-proxy,
            --target-pool, --target-vpn-gateway, --target-instance.

        --load-balancing-scheme=EXTERNAL_MANAGED (regional) or
        --load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL_MANAGED) Network that this forwarding
        rule applies to. If this field is not specified, the default network is
        used. In the absence of the default network, this field must be
        specified.

        The --network option is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming
        release. If you're currently using this argument, you should remove it
        from your workflows.

        --load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL_MANAGED) Subnetwork that this
        forwarding rule applies to. If the network is auto mode, this flag is
        optional. If the network is custom mode, this flag is required.

        The --subnet option is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming
        release. If you're currently using this argument, you should remove it
        from your workflows.

        the region is set to the region of the forwarding rule. Overrides the
        default compute/region property value for this command invocation.

        compute/region property value for this command invocation.

     --target-vpn-gateway-region=TARGET_VPN_GATEWAY_REGION
        Region of the VPN gateway to operate on. If not specified, the region
        is set to the region of the forwarding rule. Overrides the default

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --backend-service-region=BACKEND_SERVICE_REGION
          Region of the backend service to operate on. If not specified, the

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
