NAME
    gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules describe - display detailed
        information about a forwarding rule

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules describe NAME
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules describe displays all data
    associated with a forwarding rule in a project.

EXAMPLES
    To get details about a global forwarding rule, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules describe FORWARDING-RULE \
            --global

    To get details about a regional forwarding rule, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules describe FORWARDING-RULE \
            --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the forwarding rule to describe.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the forwarding rule is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the forwarding rule to describe. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe

        $ gcloud beta compute forwarding-rules describe
