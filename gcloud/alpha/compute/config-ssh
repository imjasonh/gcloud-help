NAME
    gcloud alpha compute config-ssh - populate SSH config files with Host
        entries from each instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute config-ssh [--dry-run] [--force-key-file-overwrite]
        [--remove] [--ssh-config-file=SSH_CONFIG_FILE]
        [--ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute config-ssh makes SSHing to virtual machine
    instances easier by adding an alias for each instance to the user SSH
    configuration (~/.ssh/config) file.

    In most cases, it is sufficient to run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute config-ssh

    Each instance will be given an alias of the form NAME.ZONE.PROJECT. For
    example, if example-instance resides in us-central1-a, you can SSH to it by
    running:

        $ ssh example-instance.us-central1-a.MY-PROJECT

    On some platforms, the host alias can be tab-completed, making the long
    alias less daunting to type.

    The aliases created interface with SSH-based programs like scp(1), so it is
    possible to use the aliases elsewhere:

        $ scp ~/MY-FILE example-instance.us-central1-a.MY-PROJECT:~

    Whenever instances are added, removed, or their external IP addresses are
    changed, this command should be re-executed to update the configuration.

    This command ensures that the user's public SSH key is present in the
    project's metadata. If the user does not have a public SSH key, one is
    generated using ssh-keygen(1) (if the --quiet flag is given, the generated
    key will have an empty passphrase).

EXAMPLES
    To populate SSH config file with Host entries from each running instance,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute config-ssh

    To remove the change to the SSH config file by this command, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute config-ssh --remove

FLAGS
     --dry-run
        If provided, the proposed changes to the SSH config file are printed to
        standard output and no actual changes are made.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled, the gcloud command-line tool will regenerate and overwrite
        the files associated with a broken SSH key without asking for
        confirmation in both interactive and non-interactive environments.

        If disabled, the files associated with a broken SSH key will not be
        regenerated and will fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environments.

     --remove
        If provided, any changes made to the SSH config file by this tool are
        reverted.

     --ssh-config-file=SSH_CONFIG_FILE
        Specifies an alternative per-user SSH configuration file. By default,
        this is ~/.ssh/config.

     --ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute config-ssh

        $ gcloud beta compute config-ssh
