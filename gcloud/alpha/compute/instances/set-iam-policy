NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for a
        Compute Engine instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances set-iam-policy (INSTANCE : --zone=ZONE)
        POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Set IAM policy for a Compute Engine instance.

EXAMPLES
    The following command reads an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    policy.json and sets it for the instance 'my-instance' and zone 'ZONE':

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances set-iam-policy my-instance \
            --zone=ZONE policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - The instance to set the IAM policy of. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.
     (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
     set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance.

          To set the instance attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --zone=ZONE
          The name of the Google Compute Engine zone.

          To set the zone attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --zone on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/zone.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/compute/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances set-iam-policy

        $ gcloud beta compute instances set-iam-policy
