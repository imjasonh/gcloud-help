NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances ops-agents policies describe - describe a
        Google Cloud's operations suite agents (Ops Agents) policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances ops-agents policies describe POLICY_ID
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances ops-agents policies describe
    describes a policy that facilitates agent management across Compute Engine
    instances based on user specified instance filters. This policy installs,
    specifies versioning, enables autoupgrade, and removes Ops Agents.

    The command returns the content of one policy. For instance:

        agent_rules:
        - enable_autoupgrade: true
          package_state: installed
          type: ops-agent
          version: latest
        assignment:
          group_labels:
          - app: myapp
            env: prod
          os_types:
          - short_name: ubuntu
            version: '18.04'
          zones:
          - us-central1-a
        create_time: '2021-02-02T02:10:25.344Z'
        description: A test policy to install agents
        etag: <ETAG>
        id: projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/guestPolicies/ops-agents-test-policy
        update_time: '2021-02-02T02:10:25.344Z'

    If no policies are found, it returns a NOT_FOUND error.

EXAMPLES
    To describe an Ops Agents policy named ops-agents-test-policy in the
    current project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances ops-agents policies describe \
            ops-agents-test-policy

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     POLICY_ID
        ID of the policy.

        This ID must start with ops-agents-, contain only lowercase letters,
        numbers, and hyphens, end with a number or a letter, be between 1-63
        characters, and be unique within the project. The goal of the prefix
        ops-agents- is to easily distinguish these Ops Agents specific policies
        from other generic policies and lower the chance of naming conflicts.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies describe
