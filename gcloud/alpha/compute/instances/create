DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances create facilitates the creation of
    Compute Engine virtual machines.

    When an instance is in RUNNING state and the system begins to boot, the
    instance creation is considered finished, and the command returns with a
    list of new virtual machines. Note that you usually cannot log into a new
    instance until it finishes booting. Check the progress of an instance using
    gcloud compute instances get-serial-port-output.

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create an instance with the latest 'Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8' image
    available, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances create example-instance \
            --image-family=rhel-8 --image-project=rhel-cloud \
            --zone=us-central1-a

    To create instances called 'example-instance-1', 'example-instance-2', and
    'example-instance-3' in the 'us-central1-a' zone, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances create example-instance-1 \
            example-instance-2 example-instance-3 --zone=us-central1-a

    To create an instance called 'instance-1' from a source snapshot called
    'instance-snapshot' in zone 'us-central1-a' and attached regional disk
    'disk-1', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances create instance-1 \
            --source-snapshot=https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/\
        projects/myproject/global/snapshots/instance-snapshot \
            --zone=us-central1-a --disk=name=disk1,scope=regional

    To create an instance called instance-1 as a Shielded VM instance with
    Secure Boot, virtual trusted platform module (vTPM) enabled and integrity
    monitoring, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances create instance-1 \
            --zone=us-central1-a --shielded-secure-boot --shielded-vtpm \
            --shielded-integrity-monitoring

    To create a preemptible instance called 'instance-1', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances create instance-1 \
            --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --zone=us-central1-b \
            --preemptible --no-restart-on-failure \
            --maintenance-policy=terminate

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to create. For details on valid instance names,
        refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
        Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

         type
            The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-t4 for NVIDIA T4) of
            accelerator to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute
            accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
            types.

         count
            Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default
            value is 1.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --availability-domain=AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN
        Specifies the availability domain that this VM instance should be
        scheduled on. The number of availability domains that a VM can be
        scheduled on is specified when you create the spread placement policy.

        Specify a value from 1 to the number of domains that are available in
        your placement policy.

     --boot-disk-auto-delete
        Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted.
        Enabled by default, use --no-boot-disk-auto-delete to disable.

     --boot-disk-device-name=BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
        The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This
        option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
        opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

     --boot-disk-interface=BOOT_DISK_INTERFACE
        Indicates the interface to use for the boot disk. The value must be one
        of the following:
        ◆ SCSI
        ◆ NVME

     --boot-disk-provisioned-iops=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_IOPS
        Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the number
        of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle.

     --boot-disk-provisioned-throughput=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_THROUGHPUT
        Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk. This sets the
        number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.

     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
        terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. Disk size
        must be a multiple of 1 GB. Default size unit is GB.

     --boot-disk-type=BOOT_DISK_TYPE
        The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
        compute disk-types list.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
        non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

     --create-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

         name
            Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if
            more than one instance is being created.

         description
            Optional textual description for the disk being created.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default.

         image
            Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized
            with. A new disk will be created based on the given image. To view
            a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud compute images
            list. It is best practice to use image when a specific version of
            an image is needed. If both image and image-family flags are
            omitted a blank disk will be created.

         image-family
            The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will
            be initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux
            distributions, some of which are available as both regular and
            Shielded VM images. When a family is specified instead of an image,
            the latest non-deprecated image associated with that family is
            used. It is best practice to use --image-family when the latest
            version of an image is needed.

         image-project
            The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
            references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
            image-project. A full list of available image projects can be
            generated by running gcloud compute images list.

            ▸ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
              provided.
            ▸ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
              projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to
              be used.
            ▸ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided,
              the current default project is used.

         size
            The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
            a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,
            or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte
            disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the
            default image size will be used for the new disk.

         type
            The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $
            gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
            pd-standard.

         device-name
            An optional name to display the disk name in the guest operating
            system. If omitted, a device name of the form persistent-disk-N is
            used.

         provisioned-iops
            Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the
            number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value
            must be between 10,000 and 120,000.

         provisioned-throughput
            Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk. This sets
            the number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.

         disk-resource-policy
            Resource policy to apply to the disk. Specify a full or partial
            URL. For example:
            ▸ https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy
            ▸ projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy

            For more information, see the following docs:
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/resource-policies/
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

         architecture
            Specifies the architecture or processor type that this disk can
            support. For available processor types on Compute Engine, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms.

         storage-pool
            The name of the storage pool in which the new disk is created. The
            new disk and the storage pool must be in the same location.

         interface
            The interface to use with the disk. The value must be one of the
            following:
            ▸ SCSI
            ▸ NVME

         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The instance will use
            the first partition of the disk for its root file system. The
            default value for this is no.

         kms-key
            Fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name that will protect the
            disk.

            This can either be the fully qualified path or the name.

            The fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name format is:
            projects/<kms-project>/locations/<kms-location>/keyRings/<kms-keyring>/
            cryptoKeys/<key-name>.

            If the value is not fully qualified then kms-location, kms-keyring,
            and optionally kms-project are required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-project
            Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the
            disk.

            If the project is not specified then the project where the disk is
            being created will be used.

            If this flag is set then key-location, kms-keyring, and kms-key are
            required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-location
            Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the
            disk.

            All Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a list
            of possible locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'. If this flag
            is set then kms-keyring and kms-key are required. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-keyring
            The keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will
            protect the disk.

            If this flag is set then kms-location and kms-key are required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         source-snapshot
            The source disk snapshot that will be used to create the disk. You
            can provide this as a full URL to the snapshot or just the snapshot
            name. For example, the following are valid values:

            ▸ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/snapshots/snapshot
            ▸ snapshot

         source-snapshot-csek-required
            The CSK protected source disk snapshot that will be used to create
            the disk. This can be provided as a full URL to the snapshot or
            just the snapshot name. Must be specified with
            source-snapshot-csek-key-file. The following are valid values:

            ▸ https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/snapshots/snapshot
            ▸ snapshot

         source-snapshot-csek-key-file
            Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file for the
            source snapshot. Must be specified with
            source-snapshot-csek-required.

         source-instant-snapshot
            The source disk instant snapshot that will be used to create the
            disk. You can provide this as a full URL to the instant snapshot.
            For example, the following is a valid value:

            ▸ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/zones/myzone/instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot

         image-csek-required
            Specifies the name of the CSK protected image that the disk will be
            initialized with. A new disk will be created based on the given
            image. To view a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud
            compute images list. It is best practice to use image when a
            specific version of an image is needed. If both image and
            image-family flags are omitted a blank disk will be created. Must
            be specified with image-csek-key-file.

         image-csek-key-file
            Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file for the
            image. Must be specified with image-csek-required.

         multi-writer
            If yes, the disk is created in multi-writer mode so that it can be
            attached with read-write access to two VMs. The default value is
            no. The multi-writer feature requires specialized filesystems,
            among other restrictions. For more information, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/sharing-disks-between-vms.

         confidential-compute
            If yes, the disk is created in confidential mode. The default value
            is no. Encryption with a Cloud KMS key is required to enable this
            option.

         replica-zones
            Required for each regional disk associated with the instance.
            Specify the URLs of the zones where the disk should be replicated
            to. You must provide exactly two replica zones, and one zone must
            be the same as the instance zone.

         labels
            List of label KEY=VALUE pairs separated by : character to add to
            the disk.

            Example: Key1=Value1:Key2=Value2:Key3=Value3.

            Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
            (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values
            must contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase
            characters, and numbers.

         source-snapshot-region
            The region of the source snapshot that will be used to create the
            disk. You can provide region name to use regional snapshot as the
            source snapshot.

     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file that maps
        Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when creating,
        mounting, or taking snapshots of disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag, the CSEK is read from stdin. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --deletion-protection
        Enables deletion protection for the instance.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description of the instances.

     --discard-local-ssds-at-termination-timestamp=DISCARD_LOCAL_SSDS_AT_TERMINATION_TIMESTAMP
        Required to be set to true and only allowed for VMs that have one or
        more local SSDs, use --instance-termination-action=STOP, and use either
        --max-run-duration or --termination-time.

        This flag indicates the value that you want Compute Engine to use for
        the --discard-local-ssd flag in the automatic gcloud compute instances
        stop command. This flag only supports the true value, which discards
        local SSD data when automatically stopping this VM during its
        terminationTimestamp.

        For more information about the --discard-local-ssd flag, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#stop_instance.

     --disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[boot=BOOT],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[force-attach=FORCE-ATTACH],[interface=INTERFACE],[mode=MODE],[name=NAME],[scope=SCOPE]
        Attaches an existing disk to the instances.

         name
            The disk to attach to the instances. If you create more than one
            instance, you can only attach a disk in read-only mode. By default,
            you attach a zonal disk located in the same zone of the instance.
            If you want to attach a regional disk, you must specify the disk
            using its URI; for example,
            projects/myproject/regions/us-central1/disks/my-regional-disk.

         mode
            The mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for read-only mode
            and rw for read-write mode. If omitted, rw is used as a default
            value. If you use rw when creating more than one instance, you
            encounter errors.

         boot
            If set to yes, you attach a boot disk. The virtual machine then
            uses the first partition of the disk for the root file systems. The
            default value for this is no.

         device-name
            An optional name to display the disk name in the guest operating
            system. If omitted, a device name of the form persistent-disk-N is
            used.

         auto-delete
            If set to yes, the persistent disk is automatically deleted when
            the instance is deleted. However, if you detach the disk from the
            instance, deleting the instance doesn't delete the disk. The
            default value is yes.

         interface
            The interface to use for the disk. The value must be one of the
            following:
            ▸ SCSI
            ▸ NVME

         scope
            Can be zonal or regional. If zonal, the disk is interpreted as a
            zonal disk in the same zone as the instance (default). If regional,
            the disk is interpreted as a regional disk in the same region as
            the instance. The default value for this is zonal.
         force-attach
            If yes, this persistent disk will force-attached to the instance
            even it is already attached to another instance. The default value
            is 'no'.

     --enable-display-device
        Enable a display device on VM instances. Disabled by default.

     --[no-]enable-nested-virtualization
        If set to true, enables nested virtualization for the instance. Use
        --enable-nested-virtualization to enable and
        --no-enable-nested-virtualization to disable.

     --[no-]enable-uefi-networking
        If set to true, enables UEFI networking for the instance creation. Use
        --enable-uefi-networking to enable and --no-enable-uefi-networking to
        disable.

     --enable-watchdog-timer
        Enable a watchdog timer device on VM instances. Disabled by default.

     --erase-windows-vss-signature
        Specifies whether the disk restored from source snapshots or source
        machine image should erase Windows specific VSS signature. See
        https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/disks/snapshot#--guest-flush

     --external-ipv6-address=EXTERNAL_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given external IPv6 address to the instance that is
        created. The address must be the first IP address in the range. This
        option can be used only when creating a single instance.

     --external-ipv6-prefix-length=EXTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        The prefix length of the external IPv6 address range. This field should
        be used together with --external-ipv6-address. Only the /96 IP address
        range is supported, and the default value is 96.

     --graceful-shutdown
        Enables graceful shutdown for the instance.

     --graceful-shutdown-max-duration=GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_MAX_DURATION
        Specifies the maximum time for the graceful shutdown. After this time,
        the instance is set to STOPPING even if tasks are still running.
        Specify the time as the number of hours, minutes, or seconds followed
        by h, m, and s respectively. For example, specify 30m for 30 minutes or
        20m10s for 20 minutes and 10 seconds. The value must be between 1
        second and 1 hour.

     --host-error-timeout-seconds=HOST_ERROR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
        The timeout in seconds for host error detection. The value must be set
        with 30 second increments, with a range of 90 to 330 seconds. If unset,
        the default behavior of the host error recovery is used.

     --hostname=HOSTNAME
        Specify the hostname of the instance to be created. The specified
        hostname must be RFC1035 compliant. If hostname is not specified, the
        default hostname is [INSTANCE_NAME].c.[PROJECT_ID].internal when using
        the global DNS, and [INSTANCE_NAME].[ZONE].c.[PROJECT_ID].internal when
        using zonal DNS.

     --instance-termination-action=INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION
        Specifies the termination action that will be taken upon VM preemption
        (--provisioning-model=SPOT) or automatic instance termination
        (--max-run-duration or --termination-time).

        INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION must be one of:

         DELETE
            Permanently delete the VM.
         STOP
            Default only for Spot VMs. Stop the VM without preserving memory.
            The VM can be restarted later.

     --internal-ipv6-address=INTERNAL_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given internal IPv6 address or range to the instance that
        is created. The address must be the first IP address in the range or
        from a /96 IP address range. This option can be used only when creating
        a single instance.

     --internal-ipv6-prefix-length=INTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        Optional field that indicates the prefix length of the internal IPv6
        address range. It should be used together with --internal-ipv6-address.
        Only /96 IP address range is supported and the default value is 96. If
        not set, either the prefix length from --internal-ipv6-address will be
        used or the default value of 96 will be assigned.

     --ipv6-address=IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given external IPv6 address to the instance that is
        created. The address must be the first IP address in the range. This
        option can be used only when creating a single instance.

     --ipv6-network-tier=IPV6_NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the IPv6 network tier that will be used to configure the
        instance network interface IPv6 access config. IPV6_NETWORK_TIER must
        be (only one value is supported):

         PREMIUM
            High quality, Google-grade network tier.

     --ipv6-prefix-length=IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        The prefix length of the external IPv6 address range. This field should
        be used together with --ipv6-address. Only the /96 IP address range is
        supported, and the default value is 96.

     --ipv6-public-ptr-domain=IPV6_PUBLIC_PTR_DOMAIN
        Assigns a custom PTR domain for the external IPv6 in the IPv6 access
        configuration of instance. If unspecified or specified to be an empty
        string, the default PTR record will be used. This option can only be
        specified for the default network interface, nic0.

     --key-revocation-action-type=POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the instance when the KMS key of one of its
        attached disks is revoked. The default is none. POLICY must be one of:

         none
            No operation is performed.
         stop
            The instance is stopped when the KMS key of one of its attached
            disks is revoked.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --local-nvdimm=[size=SIZE]
        Attaches a local NVDIMM to the instances.

         size
            Optional. Size of the NVDIMM disk. The value must be a whole number
            followed by a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for
            gigabyte, or TB for terabyte. For example, 3TB will produce a 3
            terabyte disk. Allowed values are: 3TB and 6TB and the default is 3
            TB.

     --local-ssd=[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
        Attaches a local SSD to the instances.

         device-name
            Optional. A name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Can only be specified if interface is SCSI. If
            omitted, a device name of the form local-ssd-N will be used.

         interface
            Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this
            SSD. Valid values are SCSI and NVME. SCSI is the default and is
            supported by more guest operating systems. NVME might provide
            higher performance.

         size
            Optional. The only valid value is 375GB. Specify the --local-ssd
            flag multiple times if you need multiple 375GB local SSD
            partitions. You can specify a maximum of 24 local SSDs for a
            maximum of 9TB attached to an instance.

     --local-ssd-recovery-timeout=LOCAL_SSD_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT
        Specifies the maximum amount of time a Local Ssd Vm should wait while
        recovery of the Local Ssd state is attempted. Its value should be in
        between 0 and 168 hours with hour granularity and the default value
        being 1 hour.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

     --maintenance-freeze-duration=MAINTENANCE_FREEZE_DURATION
        Specifies the amount of hours after instance creation where the
        instance won't be scheduled for maintenance, e.g. 4h, 2d6h. See $
        gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

     --maintenance-interval=MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL
        Specifies how infrastructure upgrades should be applied to the VM.
        MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL must be one of:

         PERIODIC
            VMs receive infrastructure and hypervisor updates on a periodic
            basis, minimizing the number of maintenance operations (live
            migrations or terminations) on an individual VM. Security updates
            will still be applied as soon as they are available.
         RECURRENT
            VMs receive infrastructure and hypervisor updates on a periodic
            basis, minimizing the number of maintenance operations (live
            migrations or terminations) on an individual VM. This may mean a VM
            will take longer to receive an update than if it was configured for
            AS_NEEDED. Security updates will still be applied as soonas they
            are available. RECURRENT is used for GEN3 and Sliceof Hardware VMs.

     --max-run-duration=MAX_RUN_DURATION
        Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a duration
        relative to the last time when the VM began running. Format the
        duration, MAX_RUN_DURATION, as the number of days, hours, minutes, and
        seconds followed by d, h, m, and s respectively. For example, specify
        30m for a duration of 30 minutes or specify 1d2h3m4s for a duration of
        1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4 seconds. Alternatively, to specify a
        timestamp, use --termination-time instead.

        If neither --max-run-duration nor --termination-time is specified
        (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or
        system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to
        be automatically terminated at the VM's termination timestamp
        (terminationTimestamp) using the action specified by
        --instance-termination-action.

        Note: The terminationTimestamp is removed whenever the VM is stopped or
        suspended and redefined whenever the VM is rerun. For
        --max-run-duration specifically, the terminationTimestamp is the sum of
        MAX_RUN_DURATION and the time when the VM last entered the RUNNING
        state, which changes whenever the VM is rerun.

     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128
        bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for
        all metadata entries is 512 KB.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

            For startup scripts on Windows instances, the following metadata
            keys have special meanings: windows-startup-script-url,
            windows-startup-script-cmd, windows-startup-script-bat,
            windows-startup-script-ps1, sysprep-specialize-script-url,
            sysprep-specialize-script-cmd, sysprep-specialize-script-bat, and
            sysprep-specialize-script-ps1. For more information, see Running
            startup scripts
            (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript).

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud alpha compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        You can find more information on-line:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --min-node-cpu=MIN_NODE_CPU
        Minimum number of virtual CPUs this instance will consume when running
        on a sole-tenant node.

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network that the VM instances are a part of. If --subnet
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by this --network flag. If neither is specified, the default network is
        used.

     --network-performance-configs=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Configures network performance settings for the instance. If this flag
        is not specified, the instance will be created with its default network
        performance configuration.

         total-egress-bandwidth-tier
            Total egress bandwidth is the available outbound bandwidth from a
            VM, regardless of whether the traffic is going to internal IP or
            external IP destinations. The following tier values are allowed:
            [DEFAULT,TIER_1]

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the instance.
        NETWORK_TIER must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is
        PREMIUM.

     --node-project=NODE_PROJECT
        The name of the project with shared sole tenant node groups to create
        an instance in.

     --numa-node-count=NUMA_NODE_COUNT
        The number of virtual NUMA nodes for the instance. Valid values are: 0,
        1, 2, 4 or 8. Setting NUMA node count to 0 means using the default
        setting.

     --partner-metadata=[NAMESPACE/KEY=VALUE,...]
        Partner metadata specifying namespace and its entries. The entries can
        be key-value pairs or in json format.

     --partner-metadata-from-file=LOCAL_FILE_PATH
        Path to a local json file containing partner metadata. Use a full or
        relative path to a local file containing the value of partner_metadata.

     --performance-monitoring-unit=PERFORMANCE_MONITORING_UNIT
        The type of performance monitoring counters (PMCs) to enable in the
        instance. PERFORMANCE_MONITORING_UNIT must be one of:

         architectural
            This enables architecturally defined non-last level cache (LLC)
            events.
         enhanced
            This enables most documented core/L2 and LLC events.
         standard
            This enables most documented core/L2 events.

     --post-key-revocation-action-type=POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the instance when the KMS key of one of its
        attached disks is revoked. The default is noop. POLICY must be one of:

         noop
            No operation is performed.
         shutdown
            The instance is shut down when the KMS key of one of its attached
            disks is revoked.

     --preemptible
        If provided, instances will be preemptible and time-limited. Instances
        might be preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and
        will only be able to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible
        instances can not be restarted and will not migrate.

     --private-ipv6-google-access-type=PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE
        The private IPv6 Google access type for the VM.
        PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of:
        enable-bidirectional-access, enable-outbound-vm-access,
        inherit-subnetwork.

     --private-network-ip=PRIVATE_NETWORK_IP
        Specifies the RFC1918 IP to assign to the instance. The IP should be in
        the subnet or legacy network IP range.

     --provisioning-model=PROVISIONING_MODEL
        Specifies the provisioning model for your VM instances. This choice
        affects the price, availability, and how long your VM instances can
        run. PROVISIONING_MODEL must be one of:

         FLEX_START
            Instance is provisioned using the Flex Start provisioning model and
            has a limited runtime.
         RESERVATION_BOUND
            The VM instances run for the entire duration of their associated
            reservation. You can only specify this provisioning model if you
            want your VM instances to consume a specific reservation with
            either a calendar reservation mode or a dense deployment type.
         SPOT
            Compute Engine may stop a Spot VM instance whenever it needs
            capacity. Because Spot VM instances don't have a guaranteed
            runtime, they come at a discounted price.
         STANDARD
            The default option. The STANDARD provisioning model gives you full
            control over your VM instances' runtime.

     --require-csek-key-create
        Refuse to create resources not protected by a user managed key in the
        key file when --csek-key-file is given. This behavior is enabled by
        default to prevent incorrect gcloud invocations from accidentally
        creating resources with no user managed key. Disabling the check allows
        creation of some resources without a matching Customer-Supplied
        Encryption Key in the supplied --csek-key-file. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details. Enabled by default, use --no-require-csek-key-create
        to disable.

     --resource-manager-tags=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Specifies a list of resource manager tags to apply to the instance.

     --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...]
        A list of resource policy names to be added to the instance. The
        policies must exist in the same region as the instance.

     --restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.
        Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --secure-tags=SECURE_TAG,[SECURE_TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of secure tags to apply to the instance. These tags
        allow network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute network firewall-policies rules create(1)
        for more details.

     --shielded-integrity-monitoring
        Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the
        instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy
        baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly
        trusted boot image when the instance is created. This baseline can be
        updated by using gcloud compute instances update
        --shielded-learn-integrity-policy. On Shielded VM instances, integrity
        monitoring is enabled by default. For information about how to modify
        Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.
        For information about monitoring integrity on Shielded VM instances,
        see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/integrity-monitoring."

     --shielded-secure-boot
        The instance boots with secure boot enabled. On Shielded VM instances,
        Secure Boot is not enabled by default. For information about how to
        modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --shielded-vtpm
        The instance boots with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled. A
        TPM is a hardware module that can be used for different security
        operations such as remote attestation, encryption, and sealing of keys.
        On Shielded VM instances, vTPM is enabled by default. For information
        about how to modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --source-instance-template=SOURCE_INSTANCE_TEMPLATE
        The name of the instance template that the instance will be created
        from. An instance template can be a global/regional resource.

        Users can override instance properties using other flags.

     --source-machine-image=SOURCE_MACHINE_IMAGE
        The name of the machine image that the instance will be created from.

     --source-machine-image-csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping
        resources to user managed keys which were used to encrypt the source
        machine-image. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        Specifies whether IPv6 is enabled on the default network interface. If
        not specified, IPV4_ONLY will be used. STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            The network interface can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
         IPV4_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv4 addresses
         IPV6_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv6 addresses

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet that the VM instances are a part of. If --network
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by the --network flag.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instance. These tags allow
        network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1) for more
        details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list instances with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list instances tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     --termination-time=TERMINATION_TIME
        Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a time. Format
        the time, TERMINATION_TIME, as a RFC 3339 timestamp. For more
        information, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339. Alternatively, to
        specify a duration, use --max-run-duration instead.

        If neither --termination-time nor --max-run-duration is specified
        (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or
        system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to
        be automatically terminated at the VM's termination timestamp
        (terminationTimestamp) using the action specified by
        --instance-termination-action.

        Note: The terminationTimestamp is removed whenever the VM is stopped or
        suspended and redefined whenever the VM is rerun. For
        --termination-time specifically, the terminationTimestamp remains the
        same whenever the VM is rerun, but any requests to rerun the VM fail if
        the specified timestamp is in the past.

     --threads-per-core=THREADS_PER_CORE
        The number of visible threads per physical core. To disable
        simultaneous multithreading (SMT) set this to 1. Valid values are: 1 or
        2.

        For more information about configuring SMT, see:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/configuring-simultaneous-multithreading.

     --turbo-mode=TURBO_MODE
        Turbo mode to use for the instance. Supported modes include:
        ◆ ALL_CORE_MAX

        To achieve all-core-turbo frequency for more consistent CPU
        performance, set the field to ALL_CORE_MAX. The field is unset by
        default, which results in maximum performance single-core boosting.

     --visible-core-count=VISIBLE_CORE_COUNT
        The number of physical cores to expose to the instance's guest
        operating system. The number of virtual CPUs visible to the instance's
        guest operating system is this number of cores multiplied by the
        instance's count of visible threads per physical core.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to create. If not specified and the compute/zone
        property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive
        mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --address=ADDRESS
          Assigns the given external address to the instance that is created.
          The address might be an IP address or the name or URI of an address
          resource. This option can only be used when creating a single
          instance.

       --no-address
          If provided, the instances are not assigned external IP addresses. To
          pull container images, you must configure private Google access if
          using Container Registry or configure Cloud NAT for instances to
          access container images directly. For more information, see:
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/using-nat

     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the disk. The 'Compute Engine Service Agent' service
     account must hold permission 'Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter'.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource.

       --boot-disk-kms-key=BOOT_DISK_KMS_KEY
          ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key.

          To set the kms-key attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-key on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --boot-disk-kms-keyring=BOOT_DISK_KMS_KEYRING
          The KMS keyring of the key.

          To set the kms-keyring attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-keyring on the command line.

       --boot-disk-kms-location=BOOT_DISK_KMS_LOCATION
          The Google Cloud location for the key.

          To set the kms-location attribute:

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --confidential-compute
          (DEPRECATED) The instance boots with Confidential Computing enabled.
          Confidential Computing is based on Secure Encrypted Virtualization
          (SEV), an AMD virtualization feature for running confidential
          instances.

          The --confidential-compute flag will soon be deprecated. Please use
          --confidential-compute-type=SEV instead

       --confidential-compute-type=CONFIDENTIAL_COMPUTE_TYPE
          The instance boots with Confidential Computing enabled. Confidential
          Computing can be based on Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) or
          Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP),
          both of which are AMD virtualization features for running
          confidential instances. Trust Domain eXtension based on Intel
          virtualization features for running confidential instances is also
          supported. CONFIDENTIAL_COMPUTE_TYPE must be one of:

           SEV
              Secure Encrypted Virtualization
           SEV_SNP
              Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging
           TDX
              Trust Domain eXtension

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value specifying the number of cores that are needed
          in the custom machine type.

          For some machine types, shared-core values can also be used. For
          example, for E2 machine types, you can specify micro, small, or
          medium.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies a custom machine type. The default is n1. For more
          information about custom machine types, see:
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#custom_machine_types

     --image-family-scope=IMAGE_FAMILY_SCOPE
        Sets the scope for the --image-family flag. By default, when specifying
        an image family in a public image project, the zonal image family scope
        is used. All other projects default to the global image. Use this flag
        to override this behavior. IMAGE_FAMILY_SCOPE must be one of: zonal,
        global.

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
        references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
        image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated by
        running gcloud projects list.
        ◆ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        ◆ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        ◆ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     --source-snapshot-region=SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_REGION
        Sets the scope for the --source-snapshot flag. By default, when
        specifying an snapshot, the global snapshot scope is used. Use this
        flag to override this behavior to use regional snapshots.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new
          boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will
          have the same name as the instance. To view a list of public images
          and projects, run $ gcloud compute images list. It is best practice
          to use --image when a specific version of an image is needed.

          When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size
          can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,
          respectively.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be
          initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions,
          some of which are available as both regular and Shielded VM images.
          When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
          non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best
          practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is
          needed.

          By default, debian-12 is assumed for this flag.

       --source-instant-snapshot=SOURCE_INSTANT_SNAPSHOT
          The name of the source disk instant snapshot that the instance boot
          disk will be created from. You can provide this as a full URL to the
          instant snapshot. For example, the following is a valid value:

          ▸ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/zones/my-zone/instantSnapshots/instant-snapshot

       --source-snapshot=SOURCE_SNAPSHOT
          The name of the source disk snapshot that the instance boot disk will
          be created from. You can provide this as a full URL to the snapshot
          or just the snapshot name. For example, the following are valid
          values:

          ▸ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/snapshots/snapshot
          ▸ snapshot

     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the instance. The 'Compute Engine Service Agent'
     service account must hold permission 'Cloud KMS CryptoKey
     Encrypter/Decrypter'. The arguments in this group can be used to specify
     the attributes of this resource.

       --instance-kms-key=INSTANCE_KMS_KEY
          ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key.

          To set the kms-key attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --instance-kms-keyring=INSTANCE_KMS_KEYRING
          The KMS keyring of the key.

          To set the kms-keyring attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-keyring on the command line.

       --instance-kms-location=INSTANCE_KMS_LOCATION
          The Google Cloud location for the key.

          To set the kms-location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-location on the command line.

       --instance-kms-project=INSTANCE_KMS_PROJECT
          The Google Cloud project for the key.

          To set the kms-project attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-project on the command line;
          ▸ set the property core/project.

          The --maintenance-policy flag is now deprecated. Please use
          --on-host-maintenance instead. MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

           MIGRATE
              The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
              temporarily impact the performance of instances during a
              migration event.
           TERMINATE
              The instances should be terminated.

       --on-host-maintenance=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
          Specifies the behavior of the VMs when their host machines undergo
          maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. For more information, see

           address
              Assigns the given external address to the instance that is
              created. Specifying an empty string will assign an ephemeral IP.
              Mutually exclusive with no-address. If neither key is present the
              instance will get an ephemeral IP.

           network
              Specifies the network that the interface will be part of. If
              subnet is also specified it must be subnetwork of this network.
              If neither is specified, this defaults to the "default" network.

           no-address
              If specified the interface will have no external IP. Mutually
              exclusive with address. If neither key is present the instance
              will get an ephemeral IP.

           network-tier

              must be one of: IPV4_ONLY, IPV4_IPV6, IPV6_ONLY. The default
              value is IPV4_ONLY.

           ipv6-network-tier
              Specifies the IPv6 network tier that will be used to configure
              the instance network interface IPv6 access config.
              IPV6_NETWORK_TIER must be PREMIUM (currently only one value is
              supported).

           internal-ipv6-address
              Assigns the given internal IPv6 address or range to the instance
              that is created. The address must be the first IP address in the
              range or from a /96 IP address range. This option can be used
              only when creating a single instance.

           internal-ipv6-prefix-length
              Optional field that indicates the prefix length of the internal
              IPv6 address range. It should be used together with
              internal-ipv6-address. Only /96 IP address range is supported and
              the default value is 96. If not set, either the prefix length
              from --internal-ipv6-address will be used or the default value of
              96 will be assigned.

           external-ipv6-address
              Assigns the given external IPv6 address to the instance that is
              created. The address must be the first IP address in the range.
              This option can be used only when creating a single instance.

           external-ipv6-prefix-length
              The prefix length of the external IPv6 address range. This field
              should be used together with external-ipv6-address. Only the /96
              IP address range is supported, and the default value is 96.

           ipv6-public-ptr-domain
              Assigns a custom PTR domain for the external IPv6 in the IPv6
              access configuration of instance. If its value is not specified,
              the default PTR record will be used. This option can only be
              specified for the default network interface, nic0.

           aliases
              Specifies the IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If
              there are multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by
              semicolons.

              For example:

                  --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"

              Each IP alias range consists of a range name and an IP range
              separated by a colon, or just the IP range. The range name is the
              name of the range within the network interface's subnet from
              which to allocate an IP alias range. If unspecified, it defaults
              to the primary IP range of the subnet. The IP range can be a CIDR
              range (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24), a single IP address (e.g.
              192.168.100.1), or a netmask in CIDR format (e.g. /24). If the IP
              range is specified by CIDR range or single IP address, it must
              belong to the CIDR range specified by the range name on the
              subnet. If the IP range is specified by netmask, the IP allocator
              will pick an available range with the specified netmask and
              allocate it to this network interface.

           network-attachment
              Specifies the network attachment that this interface should
              connect to. Mutually exclusive with --network and --subnet flags.

           vlan
              VLAN tag of a dynamic network interface, must be an integer in
              the range from 2 to 255 inclusively.

           igmp-query
              Determines if the Compute Engine Instance can receive and respond
              to IGMP query packets on the specified network interface.
              IGMP_QUERY must be one of: IGMP_QUERY_V2, IGMP_QUERY_DISABLED. It
              is disabled by default.

       --network-interface-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH
          Same as --network-interface except that the value for the entry will
          be read from a local file. This is used in case subinterfaces need to
          be specified. All field names in the json follow lowerCamelCase.

          The following additional key is allowed: subinterfaces Specifies the
          list of subinterfaces assigned to this network interface of the
          instance.

              The following keys are allowed:
              subnetwork: Specifies the subnet that the subinterface will be
              part of. The subnet should have l2-enable set and VLAN tagged.

              vlan: Specifies the VLAN of the subinterface. Can have a value
              between 2-4094. This should be the same VLAN as the subnet. VLAN tag
              within a network interface is unique.

              ipAddress: Optional. Specifies the ip address of the
              subinterface. If not specified, an ip address will be allocated from
              subnet ip range.

          An example json looks like: [ {
          "network":"global/networks/network-example",
          "subnetwork":"projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/untagged-subnet",
          "subinterfaces":[ {
          "subnetwork":"projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/tagged-subnet",
          "vlan":2, "ipAddress":"111.11.11.1" } ] } ].

          Use a full or relative path to a local file containing the value of
          network_interface.

       --network-interface-from-json-string=NETWORK_INTERFACE_JSON_STRING
          Same as --network-interface-from-file except that the value for the
          entry will be a json string. This can also be used in case
          subinterfaces need to be specified. All field names in the json
          follow lowerCamelCase.

     Sole Tenancy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --node=NODE
          The name of the node to schedule this instance on.

       --node-affinity-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          The JSON/YAML file containing the configuration of desired nodes onto
          which this instance could be scheduled. These rules filter the nodes
          according to their node affinity labels. A node's affinity labels
          come from the node template of the group the node is in.

          The file should contain a list of a JSON/YAML objects. For an
          example, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/provisioning-sole-tenant-vms#configure_node_affinity_labels.
          The following list describes the fields:

           key
              Corresponds to the node affinity label keys of the Node resource.
           operator
              Specifies the node selection type. Must be one of: IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to seek for matched nodes. NOT_IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to avoid certain nodes.
           values
              Optional. A list of values which correspond to the node affinity
              label values of the Node resource.

              Use a full or relative path to a local file containing the value
              of node_affinity_file.

       --node-group=NODE_GROUP
          The name of the node group to schedule this instance on.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --public-dns
          Assigns a public DNS name to the instance.

       --no-public-dns
          If provided, the instance will not be assigned a public DNS name.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --public-ptr
          Creates a DNS PTR record for the external IP of the instance.

       --no-public-ptr
          If provided, no DNS PTR record is created for the external IP of the
          instance. Mutually exclusive with public-ptr-domain.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --public-ptr-domain=PUBLIC_PTR_DOMAIN
          Assigns a custom PTR domain for the external IP of the instance.
          Mutually exclusive with no-public-ptr.

       --no-public-ptr-domain
          If both this flag and --public-ptr are specified, creates a DNS PTR
          record for the external IP of the instance with the PTR domain name
          being the DNS name of the instance.

     Specifies the reservation for the instance.

       --reservation=RESERVATION
          The name of the reservation, required when --reservation-affinity is
          one of: specific, specific-then-any-reservation or
          specific-then-no-reservation.

       --reservation-affinity=RESERVATION_AFFINITY; default="any"
          The type of reservation for the instance. RESERVATION_AFFINITY must
          be one of:

           any
              Consume any available, matching reservation.
           none
              Do not consume from any reserved capacity.
           specific
              Must consume from a specific reservation.
           specific-then-any-reservation
              Prefer to consume from a specific reservation, but still consume
              any available matching reservation if the specified reservation
              is not available or exhausted.
           specific-then-no-reservation
              Prefer to consume from a specific reservation, but still consume
              from the on-demand pool if the specified reservation is not
              available or exhausted.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,
          described below. However, if neither --scopes nor --no-scopes are
          specified and the project has no default service account, then the
          instance will be created with no scopes. Note that the level of
          access that a service account has is determined by a combination of
          access scopes and IAM roles so you must configure both access scopes
          and IAM roles for the service account to work properly.

          SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. Default
          scopes are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

       --no-scopes
          Create instance without scopes

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          A service account is an identity attached to the instance. Its access
          tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and are
          used to authenticate applications on the instance. The account can be
          set using an email address corresponding to the required service
          account.

          If not provided, the instance will use the project's default service
          account.

       --no-service-account
          Create instance without service account
