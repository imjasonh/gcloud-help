NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances suspend - suspend a virtual machine instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances suspend INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        [--async] [--discard-local-ssd] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances suspend is used to suspend a Compute
    Engine virtual machine. Suspending a VM is the equivalent of sleep or
    standby mode: the guest receives an ACPI S3 suspend signal, after which all
    VM state is saved to temporary storage. An instance can only be suspended
    while it is in the RUNNING state. A suspended instance will be put in
    SUSPENDED state.

    Note: A suspended instance can be resumed by running the gcloud beta
    compute instances resume command.

    Beta restrictions: Suspending a Preemptible VM is not supported and will
    result in an API error. Suspending a VM that is using CSEK or GPUs is not
    supported and will result in an API error.

EXAMPLES
    To suspend an instance named test-instance, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances suspend test-instance

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --discard-local-ssd
        If provided, local SSD data is discarded.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances suspend
