DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances network-interfaces update updates
    network interfaces of a Compute Engine virtual machine. For example:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances network-interfaces update \
            example-instance --zone us-central1-a --aliases r1:172.16.0.1/32

    sets 172.16.0.1/32 from range r1 of the default interface's subnetwork as
    the interface's alias IP.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --aliases=ALIASES
        The IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If there are
        multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by semicolons.

        Can be specified together with --network and/or --subnetwork to choose
        IP alias ranges in the new subnetwork. If unspecified, then the
        previous IP alias ranges will be allocated in the new subnetwork. If
        the previous IP alias ranges are not available in the new subnetwork,
        then other available IP alias ranges of the same size will be allocated
        in the new subnetwork.

        For example:

            --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;r1:/32"

     --external-ipv6-address=EXTERNAL_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given external IPv6 address to an instance. The address
        must be the first IP in the range. This option is applicable only to
        dual-stack instances with stack-type=IPV4_ONLY.

     --external-ipv6-prefix-length=EXTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        The prefix length of the external IPv6 address range. This flag should
        be used together with --external-ipv6-address. Currently only /96 is
        supported and the default value is 96.

     --internal-ipv6-address=INTERNAL_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given internal IPv6 address or range to an instance. The
        address must be the first IP in the range or a IP range with /96. This
        option can only be used on a dual stack instance network interface.

     --internal-ipv6-prefix-length=INTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        Optional field that indicates the prefix length of the internal IPv6
        address range, should be used together with
        --internal-ipv6-address=fd20::. Currently only /96 is supported and the
        default value is 96. If not set, the prefix length from
        --internal-ipv6-address=fd20::/96 will be used or assigned a default
        value of 96.

     --ipv6-address=IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given external IPv6 address to an instance. The address
        must be the first IP in the range. This option is applicable only to
        dual-stack instances with stack-type=IPV4_ONLY.

     --ipv6-network-tier=IPV6_NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the IPv6 network tier that will be used to configure the
        instance network interface IPv6 access config. IPV6_NETWORK_TIER must
        be (currently only one value is supported):

         PREMIUM
            High quality, Google-grade network tier.

     --ipv6-prefix-length=IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        The prefix length of the external IPv6 address range. This flag should
        be used together with --ipv6-address. Currently only /96 is supported
        and the default value is 96.

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network this network interface belongs to.

     --network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"
        The name of the network interface to update.

     --private-network-ip=PRIVATE_NETWORK_IP
        Assign the given IP address to the interface. Can be specified only
        together with --network and/or --subnetwork to choose the IP address in
        the new subnetwork. If unspecified, then the previous IP address will
        be allocated in the new subnetwork. If the previous IP address is not
        available in the new subnetwork, then another available IP address will
        be allocated automatically from the new subnetwork CIDR range.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        The stack type for the default network interface. Determines if IPv6 is
        enabled on the default network interface. STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            The network interface can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
         IPV4_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv4 addresses.

     --subnetwork=SUBNETWORK
        Specifies the subnetwork this network interface belongs to.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances network-interfaces update

        $ gcloud beta compute instances network-interfaces update
