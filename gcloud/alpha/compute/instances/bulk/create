DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances bulk create facilitates the creation
    of multiple Compute Engine virtual machines with a single command. They
    offer a number of advantages compared to the single instance creation
    command. This includes the ability to automatically pick a zone in which to
    create instances based on resource availability, the ability to specify
    that the request be atomic or best-effort, and a faster rate of instance
    creation.

EXAMPLES
    To create instances called 'example-instance-1', 'example-instance-2', and
    'example-instance-3' in the 'us-central1-a' zone, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances bulk create \
            --predefined-names=example-instance-1,example-instance-2,\
        example-instance-3 --zone=us-central1-a

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --name-pattern=NAME_PATTERN
          Name pattern for generating instance names. Specify a pattern with a
          single sequence of hash (#) characters that will be replaced with
          generated sequential numbers of instances. E.g. name pattern of
          'instance-###' will generate instance names 'instance-001',
          'instance-002', and so on, until the number of virtual machines
          specified using --count is reached. If instances matching name
          pattern exist, the new instances will be assigned names to avoid
          clashing with the existing ones. E.g. if there exists instance-123,
          the new instances will start at instance-124 and increment from
          there.

       --predefined-names=[INSTANCE_NAME,...]
          List of predefined names for the Compute Engine virtual machines
          being created. If --count is specified alongside this flag, provided
          count must equal the amount of names provided to this flag. If
          --count is not specified, the number of virtual machines created will
          equal the number of names provided.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region in which to create the Compute Engine virtual machines.
          Compute Engine will select a zone in which to create all virtual
          machines.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone in which to create the Compute Engine virtual machines.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
        Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

         type
            The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
            accelerator to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute
            accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
            types.

         count
            Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default
            value is 1.

     --no-address
        If provided, the instances are not assigned external IP addresses. To
        pull container images, you must configure private Google access if
        using Container Registry or configure Cloud NAT for instances to access
        container images directly. For more information, see:
        ◆ https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access
        ◆ https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/using-nat

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --boot-disk-auto-delete
        Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted.
        Enabled by default, use --no-boot-disk-auto-delete to disable.

     --boot-disk-device-name=BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
        The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This
        option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
        opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

     --boot-disk-provisioned-iops=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_IOPS
        Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the number
        of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value must be
        between 10,000 and 120,000.

     --boot-disk-provisioned-throughput=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_THROUGHPUT
        Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk. This sets the
        number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.

     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
        terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. Disk size
        must be a multiple of 1 GB. Default size unit is GB.

     --boot-disk-type=BOOT_DISK_TYPE
        The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
        compute disk-types list.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
        non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

     --count=COUNT
        Number of Compute Engine virtual machines to create. If specified, and
        --predefined-names is specified, count must equal the amount of names
        provided to --predefined-names. If not specified, the number of virtual
        machines created will equal the number of names provided to
        --predefined-names.

     --create-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

         name
            Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if
            more than one instance is being created.

         description
            Optional textual description for the disk being created.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default.

         image
            Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized
            with. A new disk will be created based on the given image. To view
            a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud compute images
            list. It is best practice to use image when a specific version of
            an image is needed. If both image and image-family flags are
            omitted a blank disk will be created.

         image-family
            The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will
            be initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux
            distributions, some of which are available as both regular and
            Shielded VM images. When a family is specified instead of an image,
            the latest non-deprecated image associated with that family is
            used. It is best practice to use --image-family when the latest
            version of an image is needed.

         image-project
            The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
            references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
            image-project. A full list of available image projects can be
            generated by running gcloud compute images list.

            ▸ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
              provided.
            ▸ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
              projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to
              be used.
            ▸ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided,
              the current default project is used.

         size
            The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
            a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,
            or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte
            disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the
            default image size will be used for the new disk.

         type
            The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $
            gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
            pd-standard.

         device-name
            An optional name to display the disk name in the guest operating
            system. If omitted, a device name of the form persistent-disk-N is
            used.

         provisioned-iops
            Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the
            number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value
            must be between 10,000 and 120,000.

         provisioned-throughput
            Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk. This sets
            the number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.

         disk-resource-policy
            Resource policy to apply to the disk. Specify a full or partial
            URL. For example:
            ▸ https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy
            ▸ projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy

            For more information, see the following docs:
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/resource-policies/
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

         architecture
            Specifies the architecture or processor type that this disk can
            support. For available processor types on Compute Engine, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms.

         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The instance will use
            the first partition of the disk for its root file system. The
            default value for this is no.

         kms-key
            Fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name that will protect the
            disk.

            This can either be the fully qualified path or the name.

            The fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name format is:
            projects/<kms-project>/locations/<kms-location>/keyRings/<kms-keyring>/
            cryptoKeys/<key-name>.

            If the value is not fully qualified then kms-location, kms-keyring,
            and optionally kms-project are required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-project
            Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the
            disk.

            If the project is not specified then the project where the disk is
            being created will be used.

            If this flag is set then key-location, kms-keyring, and kms-key are
            required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-location
            Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the
            disk.

            All Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a list
            of possible locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'. If this flag
            is set then kms-keyring and kms-key are required. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-keyring
            The keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will
            protect the disk.

            If this flag is set then kms-location and kms-key are required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         source-snapshot
            The source disk snapshot that will be used to create the disk. You
            can provide this as a full URL to the snapshot or just the snapshot
            name. For example, the following are valid values:

            ▸ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/snapshots/snapshot
            ▸ snapshot

         image-csek-required
            Specifies the name of the CSK protected image that the disk will be
            initialized with. A new disk will be created based on the given
            image. To view a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud
            compute images list. It is best practice to use image when a
            specific version of an image is needed. If both image and
            image-family flags are omitted a blank disk will be created. Must
            be specified with image-csek-key-file.

         image-csek-key-file
            Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file for the
            image. Must be specified with image-csek-required.

         replica-zones
            Required for each regional disk associated with the instance.
            Specify the URLs of the zones where the disk should be replicated
            to. You must provide exactly two replica zones, and one zone must
            be the same as the instance zone.

         storage-pool
            The name of the storage pool in which the new disk is created. The
            new disk and the storage pool must be in the same location.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description of the instances.

     --disk=[boot=BOOT],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[name=NAME],[scope=SCOPE]
        Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified must
        already exist.

         name
            The disk to attach to the instances.

         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machines
            will use the first partition of the disk for their root file
            systems. The default value for this is no.

         device-name
            An optional name to display the disk name in the guest operating
            system. If omitted, a device name of the form persistent-disk-N is
            used.

         scope
            Can be zonal or regional. If zonal, the disk is interpreted as a
            zonal disk in the same zone as the instance (default). If regional,
            the disk is interpreted as a regional disk in the same region as
            the instance. The default value for this is zonal.

     --enable-display-device
        Enable a display device on VM instances. Disabled by default.

     --[no-]enable-nested-virtualization
        If set to true, enables nested virtualization for the instance. Use
        --enable-nested-virtualization to enable and
        --no-enable-nested-virtualization to disable.

     --[no-]enable-uefi-networking
        If set to true, enables UEFI networking for the instance creation. Use
        --enable-uefi-networking to enable and --no-enable-uefi-networking to
        disable.

     --erase-windows-vss-signature
        Specifies whether the disk restored from source snapshots or source
        machine image should erase Windows specific VSS signature. See
        https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/disks/snapshot#--guest-flush

     --host-error-timeout-seconds=HOST_ERROR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
        The timeout in seconds for host error detection. The value must be set
        with 30 second increments, with a range of 90 to 330 seconds. If unset,
        the default behavior of the host error recovery is used.

     --instance-termination-action=INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION
        Specifies the termination action that will be taken upon VM preemption
        (--provisioning-model=SPOT or --preemptible) or automatic instance
        termination (--max-run-duration or --termination-time).
        INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION must be one of:

         DELETE
            Permanently delete the VM.
         STOP
            Default. Stop the VM without preserving memory. The VM can be
            restarted later.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --local-ssd=[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
        Attaches a local SSD to the instances.

         device-name
            Optional. A name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Can only be specified if interface is SCSI. If
            omitted, a device name of the form local-ssd-N will be used.

         interface
            Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this
            SSD. Valid values are SCSI and NVME. SCSI is the default and is
            supported by more guest operating systems. NVME might provide
            higher performance.

         size
            Optional. The only valid value is 375GB. Specify the --local-ssd
            flag multiple times if you need multiple 375GB local SSD
            partitions. You can specify a maximum of 24 local SSDs for a
            maximum of 9TB attached to an instance.

     --local-ssd-recovery-timeout=LOCAL_SSD_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT
        Specifies the maximum amount of time a Local Ssd Vm should wait while
        recovery of the Local Ssd state is attempted. Its value should be in
        between 0 and 168 hours with hour granularity and the default value
        being 1 hour.

     --location-policy=[ZONE=POLICY,...]
        Policy for which zones to include or exclude during bulk instance
        creation within a region. Policy is defined as a list of key-value
        pairs, with the key being the zone name, and value being the applied
        policy. Available policies are allow and deny. Default for zones if
        left unspecified is allow.

        Example:

            gcloud compute instances bulk create --name-pattern=example-###
              --count=5 --region=us-east1
              --location-policy=us-east1-b=allow,us-east1-c=deny

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

     --maintenance-interval=MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL
        Specifies how infrastructure upgrades should be applied to the VM.
        MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL must be one of:

         PERIODIC
            VMs receive infrastructure and hypervisor updates on a periodic
            basis, minimizing the number of maintenance operations (live
            migrations or terminations) on an individual VM. Security updates
            will still be applied as soon as they are available.
         RECURRENT
            VMs receive infrastructure and hypervisor updates on a periodic
            basis, minimizing the number of maintenance operations (live
            migrations or terminations) on an individual VM. This may mean a VM
            will take longer to receive an update than if it was configured for
            AS_NEEDED. Security updates will still be applied as soonas they
            are available. RECURRENT is used for GEN3 and Sliceof Hardware VMs.

     --max-count-per-zone=[ZONE=MAX_COUNT_PER_ZONE,...]
        Maximum number of instances per zone specified as key-value pairs. The
        zone name is the key and the max count per zone is the value in that
        zone.

        Example:

            gcloud compute instances bulk create --name-pattern=example-###
              --count=5 --region=us-east1
              --max-count-per-zone=us-east1-b=2,us-east-1-c=1

     --max-run-duration=MAX_RUN_DURATION
        Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a duration
        relative to the VM instance's most-recent start time. Format the
        duration, MAX_RUN_DURATION, as the number of days, hours, minutes, and
        seconds followed by d, h, m, and s respectively. For example, specify
        30m for a duration of 30 minutes or specify 1d2h3m4s for a duration of
        1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4 seconds. Alternatively, to specify a
        timestamp, use --termination-time instead.

        If neither --max-run-duration nor --termination-time is specified
        (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or
        system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to
        be automatically terminated using the action specified by
        --instance-termination-action. For --max-run-duration, the VM instance
        is automatically terminated when the VM's current runtime reaches
        MAX_RUN_DURATION. Note: Anytime the VM instance is stopped or
        suspended, --max-run-duration and (unless the VM uses
        --provisioning-model=SPOT) --instance-termination-action are
        automatically removed from the VM.

     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128
        bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for
        all metadata entries is 512 KB.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

            For startup scripts on Windows instances, the following metadata
            keys have special meanings: windows-startup-script-url,
            windows-startup-script-cmd, windows-startup-script-bat,
            windows-startup-script-ps1, sysprep-specialize-script-url,
            sysprep-specialize-script-cmd, sysprep-specialize-script-bat, and
            sysprep-specialize-script-ps1. For more information, see Running
            startup scripts
            (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript).

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

     --min-count=MIN_COUNT
        The minimum number of Compute Engine virtual machines that must be
        successfully created for the operation to be considered a success. If
        the operation successfully creates as many virtual machines as
        specified here they will be persisted, otherwise the operation rolls
        back and deletes all created virtual machines. If not specified, this
        value is equal to --count.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud alpha compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --min-node-cpu=MIN_NODE_CPU
        Minimum number of virtual CPUs this instance will consume when running
        on a sole-tenant node.

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network that the VM instances are a part of. If --subnet
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by this --network flag. If neither is specified, the default network is
        used.

     --network-interface=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a network interface to the instance. Mutually exclusive with any
        of these flags: --network, --network-tier, --subnet. This flag can be
        repeated to specify multiple network interfaces.

         network
            Specifies the network that the interface will be part of. If subnet
            is also specified it must be subnetwork of this network. If neither
            is specified, this defaults to the "default" network.

         network-tier
            Specifies the network tier of the interface. NETWORK_TIER must be
            one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is PREMIUM.

         subnet
            Specifies the subnet that the interface will be part of. If network

            specified instances will get ephemeral IPs.

         queue-count
            Specifies the networking queue count for this interface. Both Rx
            and Tx queues will be set to this number. If it's not specified, a
            default queue count will be assigned. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/network-bandwidth#rx-tx for
            more details.

     --network-performance-configs=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Configures network performance settings for the instance. If this flag
        is not specified, the instance will be created with its default network
        performance configuration.

         total-egress-bandwidth-tier
            Total egress bandwidth is the available outbound bandwidth from a
            VM, regardless of whether the traffic is going to internal IP or
            external IP destinations. The following tier values are allowed:
            [DEFAULT,TIER_1]

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the instance.

        The number of virtual NUMA nodes for the instance. Valid values are: 0,
        1, 2, 4 or 8. Setting NUMA node count to 0 means using the default
        setting.

     --per-instance-hostnames=[INSTANCE_NAME=INSTANCE_HOSTNAME,...]
        Specify the hostname of the instance to be created. The specified
        hostname must be RFC1035 compliant. If hostname is not specified, the
        default hostname is [INSTANCE_NAME].c.[PROJECT_ID].internal when using
        the global DNS, and [INSTANCE_NAME].[ZONE].c.[PROJECT_ID].internal when
        using zonal DNS.

     --performance-monitoring-unit=PERFORMANCE_MONITORING_UNIT
        The set of performance measurement counters to enable for the instance.
        PERFORMANCE_MONITORING_UNIT must be one of:

         architectural

         enhanced
            Enable most documented core/L2 and LLC events.
         standard
            Enable most documented core/L2 events.

     --post-key-revocation-action-type=POLICY

            disks is revoked.

     --preemptible
        If provided, instances will be preemptible and time-limited. Instances
        might be preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and
        will only be able to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible
        instances can not be restarted and will not migrate.

     --provisioning-model=PROVISIONING_MODEL
        Specifies provisioning model, which determines price, obtainability,
        and runtime for the VM instance. PROVISIONING_MODEL must be one of:

         SPOT
            Spot VMs are spare capacity; Spot VMs are discounted to have much
            lower prices than standard VMs but have no guaranteed runtime. Spot
            VMs are the new version of preemptible VM instances, except Spot
            VMs do not have a 24-hour maximum runtime.
         STANDARD
            Default. Standard provisioning model for VM instances, which has
            user-controlled runtime but no Spot discounts.

     --resource-manager-tags=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Specifies a list of resource manager tags to apply to the instance.

     --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...]
        A list of resource policy names to be added to the instance. The
        policies must exist in the same region as the instance.

     --restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.
        Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --secure-tags=SECURE_TAG,[SECURE_TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of secure tags to apply to the instance. These tags
        allow network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute network firewall-policies rules create(1)
        for more details.

     --shielded-integrity-monitoring
        Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the
        instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy
        baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly
        trusted boot image when the instance is created. This baseline can be
        updated by using gcloud compute instances update
        --shielded-learn-integrity-policy. On Shielded VM instances, integrity
        monitoring is enabled by default. For information about how to modify
        Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.
        For information about monitoring integrity on Shielded VM instances,
        see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/integrity-monitoring."

     --shielded-secure-boot
        The instance boots with secure boot enabled. On Shielded VM instances,
        Secure Boot is not enabled by default. For information about how to
        modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --shielded-vtpm
        The instance boots with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled. A
        TPM is a hardware module that can be used for different security
        operations such as remote attestation, encryption, and sealing of keys.
        On Shielded VM instances, vTPM is enabled by default. For information
        about how to modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --source-instance-template=SOURCE_INSTANCE_TEMPLATE
        The name of the instance template that the instance will be created
        from. Users can override fields by specifying other flags.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        Specifies whether IPv6 is enabled on the default network interface. If
        not specified, IPV4_ONLY will be used. STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            The network interface can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
         IPV4_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv4 addresses
         IPV6_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv6 addresses

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet that the VM instances are a part of. If --network
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by the --network flag.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instance. These tags allow
        network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1) for more
        details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list instances with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list instances tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     --target-distribution-shape=SHAPE
        Specifies whether and how to distribute VMs across multiple zones in a
        region or to enforce placement of VMs in a single zone. The default
        shape is ANY_SINGLE_ZONE. SHAPE must be one of:

         ANY
            Allows creating VMs in multiple zones if one zone cannot
            accommodate all the requested VMs. The resulting distribution
            shapes can vary.
         ANY_SINGLE_ZONE
            Enforces VM placement in one allowed zone. Use this to avoid
            cross-zone network egress or to reduce network latency. This is the
            default value.
         BALANCED
            Allows distribution of VMs in zones where resources are available
            while distributing VMs as evenly as possible across selected zones
            to minimize the impact of zonal failures. Recommended for highly
            available serving or batch workloads.

     --termination-time=TERMINATION_TIME
        Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a time. Format
        the time, TERMINATION_TIME, as a RFC 3339 timestamp. For more
        information, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339. Alternatively, to
        specify a duration, use --max-run-duration instead.

        If neither --termination-time nor --max-run-duration is specified
        (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or
        system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to
        be automatically terminated using the action specified by
        --instance-termination-action. For --termination-time, the VM instance
        is automatically terminated at the specified timestamp. Note: Anytime
        the VM instance is stopped or suspended, --termination-time and (unless
        the VM uses --provisioning-model=SPOT) --instance-termination-action
        are automatically removed from the VM.

     --threads-per-core=THREADS_PER_CORE
        The number of visible threads per physical core. To disable
        simultaneous multithreading (SMT) set this to 1. Valid values are: 1 or
        2.

        For more information about configuring SMT, see:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/configuring-simultaneous-multithreading.

     --visible-core-count=VISIBLE_CORE_COUNT
        The number of physical cores to expose to the instance's guest
        operating system. The number of virtual CPUs visible to the instance's
        guest operating system is this number of cores multiplied by the
        instance's count of visible threads per physical core.

          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies a custom machine type. The default is n1. For more
          information about custom machine types, see:
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#custom_machine_types

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
        references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
        image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated by
        running gcloud projects list.
        ◆ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        ◆ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        ◆ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new
          boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will
          have the same name as the instance. To view a list of public images
          and projects, run $ gcloud compute images list. It is best practice
          to use --image when a specific version of an image is needed.

          When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size
          can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,
          respectively.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be
          initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions,
          some of which are available as both regular and Shielded VM images.
          When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
          non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best
          practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is
          needed.

          By default, debian-11 is assumed for this flag.

       --source-snapshot=SOURCE_SNAPSHOT
          The name of the source disk snapshot that the instance boot disk will
          be created from. You can provide this as a full URL to the snapshot
          or just the snapshot name. For example, the following are valid
          values:

          ▸ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/snapshots/snapshot
          ▸ snapshot

     Maintenance Behavior.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
          (DEPRECATED) Specifies the behavior of the VMs when their host
          machines undergo maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. For more
          information, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/host-maintenance-options.

          The --maintenance-policy flag is now deprecated. Please use
          --on-host-maintenance instead. MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

           MIGRATE
              The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
              temporarily impact the performance of instances during a
              migration event.
           TERMINATE
              The instances should be terminated.

       --on-host-maintenance=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
          Specifies the behavior of the VMs when their host machines undergo
          maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. For more information, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/host-maintenance-options.
          MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

           MIGRATE
              The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
              temporarily impact the performance of instances during a
              migration event.
           TERMINATE
              The instances should be terminated.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --public-dns
          Assigns a public DNS name to the instance.

       --no-public-dns
          If provided, the instance will not be assigned a public DNS name.

     Specifies the reservation for the instance.

       --reservation=RESERVATION
          The name of the reservation, required when --reservation-affinity is
          one of: specific, specific-then-any-reservation or
          specific-then-no-reservation.

       --reservation-affinity=RESERVATION_AFFINITY; default="any"
          The type of reservation for the instance. RESERVATION_AFFINITY must
          be one of:

           any
              Consume any available, matching reservation.
           none
              Do not consume from any reserved capacity.
           specific
              Must consume from a specific reservation.
           specific-then-any-reservation
              Prefer to consume from a specific reservation, but still consume
              any available matching reservation if the specified reservation
              is not available or exhausted.
           specific-then-no-reservation
              Prefer to consume from a specific reservation, but still consume
              from the on-demand pool if the specified reservation is not
              available or exhausted.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,
          described below. However, if neither --scopes nor --no-scopes are
          specified and the project has no default service account, then the
          instance will be created with no scopes. Note that the level of
          access that a service account has is determined by a combination of
          access scopes and IAM roles so you must configure both access scopes
          and IAM roles for the service account to work properly.

          SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. Default
          scopes are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

       --no-scopes
          Create instance without scopes

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          A service account is an identity attached to the instance. Its access
          tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and are
          used to authenticate applications on the instance. The account can be
          set using an email address corresponding to the required service
          account.

          If not provided, the instance will use the project's default service
          account.

       --no-service-account
          Create instance without service account
