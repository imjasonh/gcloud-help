NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances delete - delete Compute Engine virtual
        machine instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances delete INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        [--zone=ZONE] [--delete-disks=DISK_TYPE | --keep-disks=DISK_TYPE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances delete deletes one or more Compute
    Engine virtual machine instances.

EXAMPLES
    To delete an instance called 'instance-1' in the zone 'us-central-2-a',
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances delete instance-1 \
            --zone=us-central2-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to delete. For details on valid instance names,
        refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to delete. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --delete-disks=DISK_TYPE
          The types of disks to delete with instance deletion regardless of the
          disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the
          auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified accordingly
          before the instance deletion requests are issued. For more
          information on disk auto-deletion, see Set the auto-delete state of a
          zonal persistent disk
          (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/modify-persistent-disk#updateautodelete).
          DISK_TYPE must be one of:

           all
              All disk types.
           boot
              The first partition is reserved for the root filesystem.
           data
              A non-boot disk.

       --keep-disks=DISK_TYPE
          The types of disks to not delete with instance deletion regardless of
          the disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the
          auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified accordingly
          before the instance deletion requests are issued. For more
          information on disk auto-deletion, see Set the auto-delete state of a
          zonal persistent disk
          (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/modify-persistent-disk#updateautodelete).
          DISK_TYPE must be one of:

           all
              All disk types.
           boot
              The first partition is reserved for the root filesystem.
           data
              A non-boot disk.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances delete

        $ gcloud beta compute instances delete
