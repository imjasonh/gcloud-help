NAME
    gcloud alpha compute health-aggregation-policies update - update a health
        aggregation policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute health-aggregation-policies update
        (HEALTH_AGGREGATION_POLICY : --region=REGION)
        (--description=DESCRIPTION
          --healthy-percent-threshold=HEALTHY_PERCENT_THRESHOLD
          --min-healthy-threshold=MIN_HEALTHY_THRESHOLD) [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a health aggregation policy.

EXAMPLES
    The following command updates a health aggregation policy:

        $ gcloud alpha compute health-aggregation-policies update \
            <HEALTH_AGGREGATION_POLICY_NAME> --region=<REGION> \
            --healthy-percent-threshold 60 --min-healthy-threshold 2 \

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Health aggregation policy resource - The health aggregation policy you
     want to update. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument health_aggregation_policy on the command line
        with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       HEALTH_AGGREGATION_POLICY
          ID of the health aggregation policy or fully qualified identifier for
          the health aggregation policy.

          To set the health_aggregation_policy attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument health_aggregation_policy on the command
            line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Google Compute Engine region.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument health_aggregation_policy on the command
            line with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/region.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     At least one of these must be specified:

       --description=DESCRIPTION
          A textual description of the health aggregation policy.

       --healthy-percent-threshold=HEALTHY_PERCENT_THRESHOLD
          Can only be set if the policyType field is BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY.
          Specifies the threshold (as a percentage) of healthy endpoints
          required in order to consider the aggregated health result HEALTHY.
          Defaults to 60. Must be in range [0, 100]. Not applicable if the
          policyType field is DNS_PUBLIC_IP_POLICY. Can be mutated. This field
          is optional, and will be set to the default if unspecified. Note that
          both this threshold and minHealthyThreshold must be satisfied in
          order for HEALTHY to be the aggregated result. "Endpoints" refers to
          network endpoints within a Network Endpoint Group or instances within
          an Instance Group.

       --min-healthy-threshold=MIN_HEALTHY_THRESHOLD
          Can only be set if the policyType field is BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY.
          Specifies the minimum number of healthy endpoints required in order
          to consider the aggregated health result HEALTHY. Defaults to 1. Must
          be positive. Not applicable if the policyType field is
          DNS_PUBLIC_IP_POLICY. Can be mutated. This field is optional, and
          will be set to the default if unspecified. Note that both this
          threshold and healthyPercentThreshold must be satisfied in order for
          HEALTHY to be the aggregated result. "Endpoints" refers to network
          endpoints within a Network Endpoint Group or instances within an
          Instance Group.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the compute/alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/compute/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute health-aggregation-policies update
