NAME
    gcloud alpha compute vpn-gateways create - create a new Compute Engine
        Highly Available VPN gateway

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute vpn-gateways create NAME --network=NETWORK
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--gateway-ip-version=GATEWAY_IP_VERSION]
        [--interconnect-attachments=[INTERCONNECT_ATTACHMENTS,...]]
        [--region=REGION] [--stack-type=STACK_TYPE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute vpn-gateways create creates a new Highly
    Available VPN gateway.

    Highly Available VPN Gateway provides a means to create a VPN solution with
    a higher availability SLA compared to Classic Target VPN Gateway. Highly
    Available VPN gateways are simply referred to as VPN gateways in the API
    documentation and gcloud commands. A VPN Gateway can reference one or more
    VPN tunnels that connect it to external VPN gateways or Cloud VPN Gateways.

EXAMPLES
    To create a VPN gateway, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute vpn-gateways create my-vpn-gateway \
          --region=us-central1 --network=default

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the VPN Gateway to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        A reference to a network to which the VPN gateway is attached.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the VPN gateway.

     --gateway-ip-version=GATEWAY_IP_VERSION
        IP version of the HA VPN gateway. You must specify either IPv4 or IPv6.
        If you do not specify this field, every HA VPN gateway interface will
        be configured with an IPv4 address. GATEWAY_IP_VERSION must be one of:

         IPV4
            Every HA-VPN gateway interface is configured with an IPv4 address.
         IPV6
            Every HA-VPN gateway interface is configured with an IPv6 address.

     --interconnect-attachments=[INTERCONNECT_ATTACHMENTS,...]
        Names of interconnect attachments (VLAN attachments) associated with
        the VPN gateway interfaces. You must specify this field when using a
        VPN gateway for HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect. Otherwise, this field
        is optional.

        For example, --interconnect-attachments
        attachment-a-zone1,attachment-a-zone2 associates VPN gateway with
        attachment from zone1 on interface 0 and with attachment from zone2 on
        interface 1.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the VPN Gateway to create. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        The stack type of the protocol(s) enabled on this VPN gateway. If not
        provided, IPV4_ONLY will be used. STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            Both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are enabled on this VPN gateway.
         IPV4_ONLY
            Only IPv4 protocol is enabled on this VPN gateway.
         IPV6_ONLY
            Only IPv6 protocol is enabled on this VPN gateway.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute vpn-gateways create

        $ gcloud beta compute vpn-gateways create
