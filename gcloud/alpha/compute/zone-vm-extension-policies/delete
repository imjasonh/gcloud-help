NAME
    gcloud alpha compute zone-vm-extension-policies delete - delete a Compute
        Engine zone VM extension policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute zone-vm-extension-policies delete NAME [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a Compute Engine zone VM extension policy.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a zone VM extension policy, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute zone-vm-extension-policies delete \
            test-policy-name

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the zone vm extension policy to delete.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the zone vm extension policy to delete. If not specified and
        the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
        zone (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies delete
