NAME
    gcloud alpha compute org-security-policies associations create - create a
        new association between a security policy and an organization or folder
        resource

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute org-security-policies associations create
        --security-policy=SECURITY_POLICY
        [--excluded-folders=[EXCLUDED_FOLDERS,...]]
        [--excluded-projects=[EXCLUDED_PROJECTS,...]] [--name=NAME]
        [--organization=ORGANIZATION] [--replace-association-on-target]
        [--folder=FOLDER | --project-number=PROJECT_NUMBER]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute org-security-policies associations create is
    used to create organization security policy associations. An organization
    security policy is a set of rules that controls access to various
    resources.

    This command has billing implications. Projects in the hierarchy with
    effective hierarchical security policies will be automatically enrolled
    into Cloud Armor Enterprise if not already enrolled.

EXAMPLES
    To associate an organization security policy under folder with ID
    ``123456789" to folder ``987654321", run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute org-security-policies associations create \
            create --security-policy=123456789 --folder=987654321

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --security-policy=SECURITY_POLICY
        Security policy ID of the association.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --excluded-folders=[EXCLUDED_FOLDERS,...]
        List of folders to exclude from the application of this security
        policy. Folders should be specified in the form "folders/123".

     --excluded-projects=[EXCLUDED_PROJECTS,...]
        List of projects to exclude from the application of this security
        policy. Projects should be specified in the form "projects/123".

     --name=NAME
        Name to identify this association. If unspecified, the name will be set
        to "organization-{ORGANIZATION_ID}" or "folder-{FOLDER_ID}".

     --organization=ORGANIZATION
        ID of the organization to associate the security policy with. Must be
        set if SECURITY_POLICY is short name.

     --replace-association-on-target
        By default, if you attempt to insert an association to an organization
        or folder resource that is already associated with a security policy
        the method will fail. If this is set, the existing association will be
        deleted at the same time that the new association is created.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          ID of the folder to associate the security policy with.

       --project-number=PROJECT_NUMBER
          Project number to associate the security policy with.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute org-security-policies associations create
