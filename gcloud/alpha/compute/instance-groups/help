    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups - read and manipulate Compute Engine
        instance groups

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Read and manipulate Compute Engine instance groups.

    To accommodate the differences between managed and unmanaged instances,

    documentation (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/).

    See also: Instance groups API
    (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instanceGroups).
