NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed set-autohealing - set
        autohealing policy for managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed set-autohealing NAME
        [--initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY]
        [--health-check=HEALTH_CHECK | --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
          | --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) Set autohealing policy for managed instance group.

    This command is deprecated and will not be promoted to GA. Please use
    gcloud beta instance-groups managed update instead.

    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed set-autohealing updates the
    autohealing policy for an existing managed instance group.

    If health check is specified, the resulting autohealing policy will be
    triggered by the health-check signal i.e. the autohealing action (RECREATE)
    on an instance will be performed if the health-check signals that the
    instance is UNHEALTHY. If no health check is specified, the resulting
    autohealing policy will be triggered by instance's status i.e. the
    autohealing action (RECREATE) on an instance will be performed if the
    instance.status is not RUNNING.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY
        Specifies the number of seconds that a new VM takes to initialize and
        run its startup script. During a VM's initial delay period, the MIG
        ignores unsuccessful health checks because the VM might be in the
        startup process. This prevents the MIG from prematurely recreating a
        VM. If the health check receives a healthy response during the initial
        delay, it indicates that the startup process is complete and the VM is
        ready. The value of initial delay must be between 0 and 3600 seconds.
        The default value is 0. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        duration formats.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
          Name of the health check to operate on.

       --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
          (DEPRECATED) HTTP health check object used for autohealing instances
          in this group.

          HttpHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

       --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK
          (DEPRECATED) HTTPS health check object used for autohealing instances
          in this group.

          HttpsHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:
