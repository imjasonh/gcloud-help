NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests create -
        create a Compute Engine managed instance group resize request

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests create NAME
        --resize-request=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAME
        (--instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...] | --resize-by=RESIZE_BY)
        [--requested-run-duration=REQUESTED_RUN_DURATION]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a Compute Engine managed instance group resize request.

EXAMPLES
    To create a resize request for a managed instance group, run the following
    command:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests \
            create my-mig --resize-request=resize-request-1 --resize-by=1 \
            --requested-run-duration=3d1h30s

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --resize-request=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAME
        The name of the resize request to create.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
          A comma-separated list of instance names. The number of names you
          provide determines the number of instances to create with this resize
          request. The group's target size increases by this count.

       --resize-by=RESIZE_BY
          The number of instances to create with this resize request. Instances
          have automatically-generated names. The group's target size increases
          by this number.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --requested-run-duration=REQUESTED_RUN_DURATION
        The time you need the requested VMs to run before being automatically
        deleted. The value must be formatted as the number of days, hours,
        minutes, or seconds followed by d, h, m, and s respectively. For
        example, specify 30m for a duration of 30 minutes or 1d2h3m4s for 1
        day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4 seconds. The value must be between 10m
        (10 minutes) and 7d (7 days).

            If you want the managed instance group to consume a reservation or use
            FLEX_START provisioning model, then this flag is optional. Otherwise,
            it's required.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed resize-requests create

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize-requests create
