NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests describe -
        describe a Compute Engine managed instance group resize request
        resource

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests describe
        INSTANCE_GROUP_MANAGER --resize-request=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAME
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests
    describe describes a Compute Engine managed instance group resize request
    resource.

EXAMPLES
    To describe a resize request for a managed instance group, run the
    following command:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests \
            describe my-mig --resize-request=resize-request-1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_GROUP_MANAGER
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --resize-request=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAME
        The name of the resize request to describe.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified and
        the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
        zone (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed resize-requests describe

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize-requests \
            describe
