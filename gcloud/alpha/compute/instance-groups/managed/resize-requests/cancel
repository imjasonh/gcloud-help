NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests cancel -
        cancel a Compute Engine managed instance group resize request

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests cancel
        INSTANCE_GROUP_MANAGER
        (--resize-request=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAME
          | --resize-requests=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAMES,[...]) [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests cancel
    cancels one or more Compute Engine managed instance group resize requests.

    You can only cancel a resize request when it is in the ACCEPTED state.

EXAMPLES
    To cancel a resize request for a managed instance group, run the following
    command:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests \
            cancel my-mig --resize-requests=resize-request-1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_GROUP_MANAGER
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --resize-request=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAME
          (ALPHA only) The name of the resize request to cancel.

       --resize-requests=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAMES,[...]
          A list of comma-separated names of resize requests to cancel.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified and
        the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
        zone (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize-requests cancel
