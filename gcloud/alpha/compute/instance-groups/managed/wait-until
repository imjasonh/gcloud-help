SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed wait-until NAME
        (--all-instances-config-effective | --stable
          | --version-target-reached) [--timeout=TIMEOUT]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Wait until the managed instance group reaches the desired state.

EXAMPLES
    To wait until the managed instance group instance-group-1 is stable, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed wait-until \
            --stable instance-group-1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --all-instances-config-effective
          Wait until the group's all-instances configuration is applied to all
          VMs in the group.

       --stable
          Wait until the group is stable.

       --version-target-reached
          Wait until version target is reached.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        Waiting time in seconds for the group to reach the desired state.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed wait-until

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed wait-until
