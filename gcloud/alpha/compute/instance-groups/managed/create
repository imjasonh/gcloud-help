DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed create creates a
    Compute Engine managed instance group.

    For example, running:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed create \
        example-managed-instance-group --zone us-central1-a \
        --template example-instance-template --size 1

    will create one managed instance group called
    'example-managed-instance-group' in the us-central1-a zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --size=SIZE
        The initial number of instances you want in this group.

     --template=TEMPLATE
        Specifies the instance template to use when creating new instances.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --base-instance-name=BASE_INSTANCE_NAME
        The base name to use for the Compute Engine instances that will be
        created with the managed instance group. If not provided base instance
        name will be the prefix of instance group name.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description for this group.

     --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY
        Specifies the length of time during which the instance is known to be
        initializing and should not be autohealed even if unhealthy. This value
        cannot be greater than 1 hour. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --instance-redistribution-type=TYPE
        Specifies the type of the instance redistribution policy. An instance
        redistribution type lets you enable or disable automatic instance
        redistribution across zones to meet the group's target distribution
        shape.

        An instance redistribution type can be specified only for a
        non-autoscaled regional managed instance group. By default it is set to
        proactive.

        TYPE must be one of:

         none
            The managed instance group does not redistribute instances across
            zones.
         proactive
            The managed instance group proactively redistributes instances to
            meet its target distribution.

     --list-managed-instances-results=MODE
        Pagination behavior for the group's listManagedInstances API method.
        This flag does not affect the group's gcloud or console list-instances
        behavior. By default it is set to pageless. MODE must be one of:

         pageless
            Pagination is disabled for the group's listManagedInstances API
            method. maxResults and pageToken query parameters are ignored and
            all instances are returned in a single response.
         paginated
            Pagination is enabled for the group's listManagedInstances API
            method. maxResults and pageToken query parameters are respected.

     --stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME]
        Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Managed instance
        groups preserve and reattach stateful disks on VM autohealing, update,
        and recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to attach more disks.

         device-name
            (Required) Device name of the disk to mark stateful.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Specifies the auto deletion policy of the stateful disk.
            The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete this disk. Instead, detach the
              disk when its instance is deleted.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the stateful disk when
              the instance that it's attached to is permanently deleted from
              the group; for example, when the instance is deleted manually or
              when the group size is decreased.

     --stateful-external-ip=[enabled],[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]
        External IPs considered stateful by the instance group. Managed
        instance groups preserve stateful IPs on VM autohealing, update, and
        recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to make more external IPs stateful.

        At least one of the following is required:

         enabled
            Marks the IP address as stateful. The network interface named nic0
            is assumed by default when interface-name is not specified. This
            flag can be omitted when interface-name is provided explicitly.

         interface-name
            Marks the IP address from this network interface as stateful. This
            flag can be omitted when enabled is provided.

        Additional arguments:

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Prescribes what should happen to an associated static
            Address resource when a VM instance is permanently deleted.
            Regardless of the value of the delete rule, stateful IP addresses
            are always preserved on instance autohealing, update, and
            recreation operations. The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete the static IP address. Instead,
              unassign the address when its instance is permanently deleted and
              keep the address reserved.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the static IP address
              reservation when the instance that it's assigned to is
              permanently deleted from the instance group; for example, when
              the instance is deleted manually or when the group size is
              decreased.

     --stateful-internal-ip=[enabled],[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]
        Internal IPs considered stateful by the instance group. Managed
        instance groups preserve stateful IPs on VM autohealing, update, and
        recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to make more internal IPs stateful.

        At least one of the following is required:

         enabled
            Marks the IP address as stateful. The network interface named nic0
            is assumed by default when interface-name is not specified. This
            flag can be omitted when interface-name is provided explicitly.

         interface-name
            Marks the IP address from this network interface as stateful. This
            flag can be omitted when enabled is provided.

        Additional arguments:

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Prescribes what should happen to an associated static
            Address resource when a VM instance is permanently deleted.
            Regardless of the value of the delete rule, stateful IP addresses
            are always preserved on instance autohealing, update, and
            recreation operations. The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete the static IP address. Instead,
              unassign the address when its instance is permanently deleted and
              keep the address reserved.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the static IP address
              reservation when the instance that it's assigned to is
              permanently deleted from the instance group; for example, when
              the instance is deleted manually or when the group size is
              decreased.

     --target-distribution-shape=SHAPE
        Specifies how a regional managed instance group distributes its
        instances across zones within the region. The default shape is even.
        SHAPE must be one of:

         any
            The group picks zones for creating VM instances to fulfill the
            requested number of VMs within present resource constraints and to
            maximize utilization of unused zonal reservations. Recommended for
            batch workloads that do not require high availability.
         balanced
            The group prioritizes acquisition of resources, scheduling VMs in
            zones where resources are available while distributing VMs as
            evenly as possible across selected zones to minimize the impact of
            zonal failure. Recommended for highly available serving or batch
            workloads that do not require autoscaling.
         even
            The group schedules VM instance creation and deletion to achieve
            and maintain an even number of managed instances across the
            selected zones. The distribution is even when the number of managed
            instances does not differ by more than 1 between any two zones.
            Recommended for highly available serving workloads.

     --target-pool=[TARGET_POOL,...]
        Specifies any target pools you want the instances of this managed
        instance group to be part of.

     --zones=ZONE,[ZONE,...]
        If this flag is specified a regional managed instance group will be
        created. The managed instance group will be in the same region as
        specified zones and will spread instances in it between specified
        zones.

        All zones must belong to the same region. You may specify --region flag
        but it must be the region to which zones belong. This flag is mutually
        exclusive with --zone flag.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
          Name of the health check to operate on.

       --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
          (DEPRECATED) HTTP health check object used for autohealing instances
          in this group.

          HttpHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

       --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK
          (DEPRECATED) HTTPS health check object used for autohealing instances
          in this group.

          HttpsHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to create. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

     If you specify --zones flag this flag must be unspecified or specify the
     region to which the zones you listed belong.

     Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
     invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to create. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed create

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed create
