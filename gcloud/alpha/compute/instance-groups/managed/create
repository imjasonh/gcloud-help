DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed create creates a
    Compute Engine managed instance group.

EXAMPLES
    Running:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed create \
        example-managed-instance-group --zone=us-central1-a \
        --template=example-global-instance-template --size=1

    will create a managed instance group called
    'example-managed-instance-group' in the us-central1-a zone with a global
    instance template resource 'example-global-instance-template'.

    To use a regional instance template, specify the full or partial URL of the
    template.

    Running:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed create \
        example-managed-instance-group --zone=us-central1-a \
        --template=projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/\
        instanceTemplates/example-regional-instance-template --size=1

    will create a managed instance group called
    'example-managed-instance-group' in the us-central1-a zone with a regional
    instance template resource 'example-regional-instance-template'.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --size=SIZE
        Initial number of instances you want in this group.

     --template=TEMPLATE
        Specifies the instance template to use when creating new instances. An
        instance template is either a global or regional resource.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --action-on-vm-failed-health-check=ACTION_ON_FAILED_HEALTH_CHECK
        Specifies the action that a MIG performs on an unhealthy VM. A VM is
        marked as unhealthy when the application running on that VM fails a
        health check. By default, the value of the flag is set to
        default-action. ACTION_ON_FAILED_HEALTH_CHECK must be one of:

         default-action
            (Default) MIG uses the same action configured for the
            defaultActionOnFailure field.
         do-nothing
            MIG does not repair an unhealthy VM.
         repair
            MIG automatically repairs an unhealthy VM by recreating it.

     --base-instance-name=BASE_INSTANCE_NAME
        Base name to use for the Compute Engine instances that will be created
        with the managed instance group. If not provided base instance name
        will be the prefix of instance group name.

     --default-action-on-vm-failure=ACTION_ON_VM_FAILURE
        Specifies the action that a MIG performs on a failed VM. If the value
        of the onFailedHealthCheck field is DEFAULT_ACTION, then the same
        action also applies to the VMs on which your application fails a health
        check. By default, the value of the flag is set to repair.
        ACTION_ON_VM_FAILURE must be one of:

         repair
            (Default) MIG automatically repairs a failed VM by recreating it.
         do-nothing
            MIG does not repair a failed VM.
         delete
            MIG deletes a failed VM. Deleting the VM decreases the target size
            of the MIG.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description for this group.

     --[no-]force-update-on-repair
        Specifies whether to apply the group's latest configuration when
        repairing a VM. If you updated the group's instance template or
        per-instance configurations after the VM was created, then these
        changes are applied when VM is repaired. If this flag is disabled with
        -no-force-update-on-repair, then updates are applied in accordance with
        the group's update policy type. By default, this flag is disabled. Use
        --force-update-on-repair to enable and --no-force-update-on-repair to
        disable.

     --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY
        Specifies the number of seconds that a new VM takes to initialize and
        run its startup script. During a VM's initial delay period, the MIG
        ignores unsuccessful health checks because the VM might be in the
        startup process. This prevents the MIG from prematurely recreating a
        VM. If the health check receives a healthy response during the initial
        delay, it indicates that the startup process is complete and the VM is
        ready. The value of initial delay must be between 0 and 3600 seconds.
        The default value is 0. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        duration formats.

     --instance-redistribution-type=TYPE
        Specifies the type of the instance redistribution policy. An instance
        redistribution type lets you enable or disable automatic instance
        redistribution across zones to meet the group's target distribution
        shape.

        An instance redistribution type can be specified only for a
        non-autoscaled regional managed instance group. By default it is set to
        proactive.

        TYPE must be one of:

         none
            The managed instance group does not redistribute instances across
            zones.
         proactive
            The managed instance group proactively redistributes instances to
            meet its target distribution.

     --instance-selection=name=NAME,machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE[,machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE...][,rank=RANK]
        Named selection of machine types with an optional rank. For example,
        --instance-selection="name=instance-selection-1,machine-type=e2-standard-8,machine-type=t2d-standard-8,rank=0"

     --instance-selection-machine-types=[MACHINE_TYPE,...]
        Machine types that are used to create VMs in the managed instance
        group. If not provided, the machine type specified in the instance
        template is used.

     --list-managed-instances-results=MODE
        Pagination behavior for the group's listManagedInstances API method.
        This flag does not affect the group's gcloud or console list-instances
        behavior. By default it is set to pageless. MODE must be one of:

         pageless
            Pagination is disabled for the group's listManagedInstances API
            method. maxResults and pageToken query parameters are ignored and
            all instances are returned in a single response.
         paginated
            Pagination is enabled for the group's listManagedInstances API
            method. maxResults and pageToken query parameters are respected.

     --resource-manager-tags=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Specifies a list of resource manager tags to apply to the managed
        instance group. A resource manager tag is a key-value pair. You can
        attach exactly one value to a MIG for a given key. A MIG can have a
        maximum of 50 key-value pairs attached.

     --standby-policy-initial-delay=STANDBY_POLICY_INITIAL_DELAY
        Specifies the number of seconds that the MIG should wait before
        suspending or stopping a VM. The initial delay gives the initialization
        script the time to prepare your VM for a quick scale out.

     --standby-policy-mode=STANDBY_POLICY_MODE
        Defines how a MIG resumes or starts VMs from a standby pool when the
        group scales out. The default mode is manual. STANDBY_POLICY_MODE must
        be one of:

         manual
            MIG does not automatically resume or start VMs in the standby pool
            when the group scales out.
         scale-out-pool
            MIG automatically resumes or starts VMs in the standby pool when
            the group scales out, and replenishes the standby pool afterwards.

     --stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME]
        Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Managed instance
        groups preserve and reattach stateful disks on VM autohealing, update,
        and recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to attach more disks.

         device-name
            (Required) Device name of the disk to mark stateful.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Specifies the auto deletion policy of the stateful disk.
            The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete this disk. Instead, detach the
              disk when its instance is deleted.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the stateful disk when
              the instance that it's attached to is permanently deleted from
              the group; for example, when the instance is deleted manually or
              when the group size is decreased.

     --stateful-external-ip=[enabled],[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]
        External IPs considered stateful by the instance group. Managed
        instance groups preserve stateful IPs on VM autohealing, update, and
        recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to make more external IPs stateful.

        At least one of the following is required:

         enabled
            Marks the IP address as stateful. The network interface named nic0
            is assumed by default when interface-name is not specified. This
            flag can be omitted when interface-name is provided explicitly.

         interface-name
            Marks the IP address from this network interface as stateful. This
            flag can be omitted when enabled is provided.

            Additional arguments:

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Prescribes what should happen to an associated static
            Address resource when a VM instance is permanently deleted.
            Regardless of the value of the delete rule, stateful IP addresses
            are always preserved on instance autohealing, update, and
            recreation operations. The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete the static IP address. Instead,
              unassign the address when its instance is permanently deleted and
              keep the address reserved.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the static IP address
              reservation when the instance that it's assigned to is
              permanently deleted from the instance group; for example, when
              the instance is deleted manually or when the group size is
              decreased.

     --stateful-internal-ip=[enabled],[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]
        Internal IPs considered stateful by the instance group. Managed
        instance groups preserve stateful IPs on VM autohealing, update, and
        recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to make more internal IPs stateful.

        At least one of the following is required:

         enabled
            Marks the IP address as stateful. The network interface named nic0
            is assumed by default when interface-name is not specified. This
            flag can be omitted when interface-name is provided explicitly.

         interface-name
            Marks the IP address from this network interface as stateful. This
            flag can be omitted when enabled is provided.

            Additional arguments:

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Prescribes what should happen to an associated static
            Address resource when a VM instance is permanently deleted.
            Regardless of the value of the delete rule, stateful IP addresses
            are always preserved on instance autohealing, update, and
            recreation operations. The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete the static IP address. Instead,
              unassign the address when its instance is permanently deleted and
              keep the address reserved.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the static IP address
              reservation when the instance that it's assigned to is
              permanently deleted from the instance group; for example, when
              the instance is deleted manually or when the group size is
              decreased.

     --stopped-size=STOPPED_SIZE
        Specifies the target size of stopped VMs in the group.

     --suspended-size=SUSPENDED_SIZE
        Specifies the target size of suspended VMs in the group.

     --target-distribution-shape=SHAPE
        Specifies how a regional managed instance group distributes its
        instances across zones within the region. The default shape is even.
        SHAPE must be one of:

         any
            The group picks zones for creating VM instances to fulfill the
            requested number of VMs within present resource constraints and to
            maximize utilization of unused zonal reservations. Recommended for
            batch workloads that do not require high availability.
         any-single-zone
            The group schedules all instances within a single zone. The zone is
            chosen based on hardware support, current resources availability,
            and matching reservations. The group might not be able to create
            the requested number of VMs in case of zonal resource availability
            constraints. Recommended for workloads requiring extensive
            communication between VMs.
         balanced
            The group prioritizes acquisition of resources, scheduling VMs in
            zones where resources are available while distributing VMs as
            evenly as possible across selected zones to minimize the impact of
            zonal failure. Recommended for highly available serving or batch
            workloads that do not require autoscaling.
         even
            The group schedules VM instance creation and deletion to achieve
            and maintain an even number of managed instances across the
            selected zones. The distribution is even when the number of managed
            instances does not differ by more than 1 between any two zones.
            Recommended for highly available serving workloads.

     --target-pool=[TARGET_POOL,...]
        Specifies any target pools you want the instances of this managed
        instance group to be part of.

     --target-size-policy-mode=TARGET_SIZE_POLICY_MODE
        Specifies mode in which operations on size are processed.
        TARGET_SIZE_POLICY_MODE must be one of:

         bulk
            Mode in which MIG creates and starts VMs in all-or-nothing manner.
            If any VM from the request cannot be provisioned, the whole request
            waits for conditions that allow for provisioning whole capacity in
            bulk.
         individual
            Default mode in which MIG creates and starts VMs individually
            without cross-dependency between VMs. This means that in case of
            something blocking part of VMs to be provisioned, the other part
            will be created.

     --zones=ZONE,[ZONE,...]
        If this flag is specified a regional managed instance group will be
        created. The managed instance group will be in the same region as
        specified zones and will spread instances in it between specified
        zones.

        All zones must belong to the same region. You may specify --region flag
        but it must be the region to which zones belong. This flag is mutually
        exclusive with --zone flag.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
          Name of the health check to operate on.

       --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
          (DEPRECATED) HTTP health check object used for autohealing instances
          in this group.

          HttpHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

       --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK
          (DEPRECATED) HTTPS health check object used for autohealing instances
          in this group.

          HttpsHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to create. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          If you specify --zones flag this flag must be unspecified or specify
          the region to which the zones you listed belong.

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to create. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

     Parameters for setting update policy for this managed instance group.

       --update-policy-max-surge=MAX_SURGE
          Maximum additional number of VMs that can be created during the
          update process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage
          of size to the managed instance group (e.g. 10%).

       --update-policy-max-unavailable=MAX_UNAVAILABLE
          Maximum number of VMs that can be unavailable during the update
          process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of size
          to the managed instance group (e.g. 10%). Defaults to the number of
          zones in which the managed instance group operates.

       --update-policy-min-ready=MIN_READY
          Minimum time for which a newly created VM should be ready to be
          considered available. For example 10s for 10 seconds. See $ gcloud
          topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

       --update-policy-minimal-action=UPDATE_POLICY_MINIMAL_ACTION
          Use this flag to minimize disruption as much as possible or to apply
          a more disruptive action than is strictly necessary. The MIG performs
          at least this action on each VM while updating. If the update
          requires a more disruptive action than the one specified here, then
          the more disruptive action is performed. UPDATE_POLICY_MINIMAL_ACTION
          must be one of:

           none
              No action
           refresh
              Apply the new configuration without stopping VMs, if possible.
              For example, use ``refresh`` to apply changes that only affect
              metadata or additional disks.
           restart
              Apply the new configuration without replacing VMs, if possible.
              For example, stopping VMs and starting them again is sufficient
              to apply changes to machine type.
           replace
              Replace old VMs according to the
              --update-policy-replacement-method flag.

       --update-policy-most-disruptive-action=UPDATE_POLICY_MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ACTION
          Use this flag to prevent an update if it requires more disruption
          than you can afford. At most, the MIG performs the specified action
          on each VM while updating. If the update requires a more disruptive
          action than the one specified here, then the update fails and no
          changes are made. UPDATE_POLICY_MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ACTION must be one
          of:

           none
              No action
           refresh
              Apply the new configuration without stopping VMs, if possible.
              For example, use ``refresh`` to apply changes that only affect
              metadata or additional disks.
           restart
              Apply the new configuration without replacing VMs, if possible.
              For example, stopping VMs and starting them again is sufficient
              to apply changes to machine type.
           replace
              Replace old VMs according to the
              --update-policy-replacement-method flag.

       --update-policy-replacement-method=UPDATE_POLICY_REPLACEMENT_METHOD
          Type of replacement method. Specifies what action will be taken to
          update VMs. UPDATE_POLICY_REPLACEMENT_METHOD must be one of:

           recreate
              Recreate VMs and preserve the VM names. The VM IDs and creation
              timestamps might change.
           substitute
              Delete old VMs and create VMs with new names.

       --update-policy-type=UPDATE_TYPE
          Specifies the type of update process. You can specify either
          ``proactive`` so that the managed instance group proactively executes
          actions in order to bring VMs to their target versions or
          ``opportunistic`` so that no action is proactively executed but the
          update will be performed as part of other actions. UPDATE_TYPE must
          be one of:

           opportunistic
              Do not proactively replace VMs. Create new VMs and delete old
              ones on resizes of the group and when you target specific VMs to
              be updated or recreated.
           proactive
              Replace VMs proactively.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed create

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed create
