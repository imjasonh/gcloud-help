    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed all-instances-config delete -
        delete values defined in the all-instances configuration of a managed
        instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed all-instances-config delete
        NAME [--labels=KEY,[KEY,...]] [--metadata=KEY,[KEY,...]]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed all-instances-config
    delete deletes one or more values defined in the all-instances
    configuration of a managed instance group.

    To apply a revised all-instances configuration to existing instances in the
    group, use one of the following methods:

      ▪ Update instances using the update-instances command.
      ▪ Recreate instances using the recreate-instances command.
      ▪ Use the rolling-action start-update command.
      ▪ Use the API to set the group's updatePolicy.type to PROACTIVE.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the group's all-instances configuration in order to stop
    overriding the group's instance template for a label with the key label-key
    and metadata with the key metadata-key in group my-group, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed \
            all-instances-config delete my-group --metadata=metadata-key \
            --labels=label-key

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to delete the all instances
        configuration for.

FLAGS
     --labels=KEY,[KEY,...]
        Remove labels keys from the group's all instances configuration.

     --metadata=KEY,[KEY,...]
        Remove metadata keys from the group's all instances configuration.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to delete the all instances
          configuration for. If not specified, you might be prompted to select
          a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to delete the all instances
          configuration for. If not specified, you might be prompted to select
          a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed all-instances-config delete

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed all-instances-config \
            delete
