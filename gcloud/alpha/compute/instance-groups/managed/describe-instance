POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to describe an instance in.

REQUIRED FLAGS

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION

          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to describe an instance in. If not
          specified, you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode
          only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed describe-instance

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed describe-instance
