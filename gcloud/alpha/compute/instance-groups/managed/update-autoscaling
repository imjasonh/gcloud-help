DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling
    updates autoscaling parameters of specified managed instance group.

    Autoscalers can use one or more autoscaling signals. Information on using
    multiple autoscaling signals can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple-signals

    In contrast to gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed
    set-autoscaling, this command only updates specified fields. For instance:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling \
          --mode only-scale-out

    would change the mode field of the autoscaler policy, but leave the rest of
    the settings intact.

EXAMPLES
    To update an existing instance group:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling \
          --mode=only-scale-out

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --clear-scale-down-control
        If specified, the scale-down-control field will be cleared. Using this
        flag will remove any configuration set by the now-deprecated
        --scale-down-control flag. This is only useful if the MIG configuration
        had scale-down-control set in the past.

     --cpu-utilization-predictive-method=CPU_UTILIZATION_PREDICTIVE_METHOD
        Indicates whether to use a predictive algorithm when scaling based on
        CPU. CPU_UTILIZATION_PREDICTIVE_METHOD must be one of:

         none
            (Default) No predictions are made when calculating the number of VM
            instances.

         optimize-availability
            Predictive autoscaling predicts the future values of the scaling
            metric and scales the group in advance to ensure that new VM
            instances are ready in time to cover the predicted peak.

         standard
            Standard predictive autoscaling predicts the future values of the
            scaling metric and then scales the group to ensure that new VM
            instances are ready in time to cover the predicted peak.

     --max-num-replicas=MAX_NUM_REPLICAS
        Maximum number of replicas Autoscaler can set.

     --min-num-replicas=MIN_NUM_REPLICAS
        Minimum number of replicas Autoscaler can set.

     --mode=MODE
        Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

        You can turn off or restrict a group's autoscaler activities without
        affecting your autoscaler configuration. The autoscaler configuration
        persists while the activities are turned off or restricted, and the
        activities resume when the autoscaler is turned on again or when the
        restrictions are lifted.

        MODE must be one of:

         off
            Turns off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
         on
            Permits autoscaling to scale out and in (default for new
            autoscalers).
         only-scale-out
            Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.
         only-up
            (DEPRECATED) Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.

            Value only-up is deprecated. Use --mode only-scale-out instead.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-scale-in-control
          If specified, the scale-in-control field will be cleared. Using this
          flag will remove any configuration set by --scale-in-control flag.

       --scale-in-control=[max-scaled-in-replicas=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS],[max-scaled-in-replicas-percent=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS-PERCENT],[time-window=TIME-WINDOW]
          Configuration that allows slower scale in so that even if Autoscaler
          recommends an abrupt scale in of a managed instance group, it will be
          throttled as specified by the parameters.

           max-scaled-in-replicas
              Maximum allowed number of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
              recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
              deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose
              that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
              'max-scaled-in-replicas-percent'.

           max-scaled-in-replicas-percent
              Maximum allowed percent of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
              recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
              deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose
              that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
              'max-scaled-in-replicas'.

           time-window
              How long back autoscaling should look when computing
              recommendations. The autoscaler will not resize below the maximum
              allowed deduction subtracted from the peak size observed in this
              period. Measured in seconds.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --disable-schedule=SCHEDULE_NAME
          Name of the scaling schedule to be disabled.

          When a scaling schedule is disabled its configuration persists but
          the scaling schedule itself never becomes active. If you disable a
          scaling schedule that is currently active the disabled scaling
          schedule stops being effective immediately after it moves into
          DISABLED state. If there is no need to maintain capacity, the
          autoscaler starts removing instances after a 10-minute stabilization
          period and (if configured) following scale-in controls. This ensures
          you don't accidentally lose capacity immediately after the scaling
          schedule ends.

       --enable-schedule=SCHEDULE_NAME
          Name of the scaling schedule to be enabled.

          See --disable-schedule for details.

       --remove-schedule=SCHEDULE_NAME
          Name of the scaling schedule to be removed.

          Be careful with this action as scaling schedule deletion cannot be
          undone.

          You can delete any schedule regardless of its status. If you delete a
          scaling schedule that is currently active, the deleted scaling
          schedule stops being effective immediately after it is deleted. If
          there is no need to maintain capacity, the autoscaler starts removing
          instances after a 10-minute stabilization period and (if configured)
          following scale-in controls. This ensures you don't accidentally lose
          capacity immediately after the scaling schedule ends.

       --set-schedule=SCHEDULE_NAME
          A unique name for the scaling schedule to be configured.

       --update-schedule=SCHEDULE_NAME
          Name of the scaling schedule to be updated.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

     --schedule-cron=CRON_EXPRESSION
        Start time of the scaling schedule in cron format.

        This is when the autoscaler starts creating new VMs, if the group's
        current size is less than the minimum required instances. Set the start
        time to allow enough time for new VMs to boot and initialize. For
        example if your workload takes 10 minutes from VM creation to start
        serving then set the start time 10 minutes earlier than the time you
        need VMs to be ready.

     --schedule-description=DESCRIPTION
        A verbose description of the scaling schedule.

     --schedule-duration-sec=DURATION
        How long should the scaling schedule be active, measured in seconds.

        Minimum duration is 5 minutes. A scaling schedule is active from its
        start time and for its configured duration. During this time, the
        autoscaler scales the group to have at least as many VMs as defined by
        the minimum required instances. After the configured duration, if there
        is no need to maintain capacity, the autoscaler starts removing
        instances after a 10-minute stabilization period and (if configured)
        following scale-in controls.

     --schedule-min-required-replicas=MIN_REQUIRED_REPLICAS
        How many VMs the autoscaler should provision for the duration of this
        scaling schedule.

        Autoscaler provides at least this number of instances when the scaling
        schedule is active. A managed instance group can have more VMs if there
        are other scaling schedules active with more required instances or if
        another signal (for example, scaling based on CPU) requires more
        instances to meet its target.

    This configuration does not change autoscaling minimum and maximum instance
    limits which are always in effect. Autoscaler does not create more than the
    maximum number of instances configured for a group.

     --schedule-time-zone=TIME_ZONE
        Name of the timezone that the scaling schedule's start time is in.

        It should be provided as a name from the IANA tz database (for example
        Europe/Paris or UTC). It automatically adjusts for daylight savings
        time (DST). If no time zone is provided, UTC is used as a default.

        See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones for
        the list of valid timezones.
