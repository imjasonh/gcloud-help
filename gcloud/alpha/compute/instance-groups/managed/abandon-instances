NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed abandon-instances - abandon
        instances owned by a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed abandon-instances NAME
        --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed abandon-instances
    abandons one or more instances from a managed instance group, thereby
    reducing the targetSize of the group. Once instances have been abandoned,
    the currentSize of the group is automatically reduced as well to reflect
    the change.

    Abandoning an instance does not reboot or delete the underlying virtual
    machine instances, but just removes the instances from the instance group.
    If you would like to delete the underlying instances, use the
    delete-instances command instead.

    The command returns the operation status per instance, which might be FAIL,
    SUCCESS, or MEMBER_NOT_FOUND. MEMBER_NOT_FOUND is returned only for
    regional groups when the gcloud command-line tool wasn't able to resolve
    the zone from the instance name.

    For a more detailed overview of how abandoning instances from a managed
    instance group works, refer to this section:

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        Names of instances to abandon.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed abandon-instances

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed abandon-instances
