DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed instance-configs
    create creates a per-instance config for an instance controlled by a
    Compute Engine managed instance group. An instance with a per-instance
    config preserves the specified metadata and/or disks during instance
    recreation and deletion.

    Once created, the config is applied immediately to the corresponding
    instance, by performing the necessary action (for example, REFRESH), unless
    overridden by providing the --no-update-instance flag.

EXAMPLES
    To create a per-instance config with a stateful disk my-disk and to add
    stateful metadata my-key:my-value, on instance my-instance, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed instance-configs \
            create my-group --region=europe-west4 --instance=my-instance \
            --stateful-disk=device-name=my-disk,source=projects/my-project/\
        zones/us-central1-a/disks/my-disk-3 \
            --stateful-metadata="my-key=my-value"

    If my-disk did not exist previously in the per-instance config, and if it
    does not exist in the group's instance template, then the command adds
    my-disk to my-instance.

    To create a per-instance config with a stateful internal IP 192.168.0.10
    and a stateful external IP reserved in address my-address, on instance
    my-instance, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed instance-configs \
            create my-group --region=europe-west4 --instance=my-instance \
            --stateful-internal-ip=address=192.168.0.10,\
        interface-name=nic0 \
            --stateful-external-ip=address=/projects/example-project/\
        regions/europe-west4/addresses/my-address,interface-name=nic0

    If the provided IP address is not yet reserved, the MIG automatically
    creates a corresponding IP address reservation.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to create a per-instance config for.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instance=INSTANCE
        URI/name of an existing instance in the managed instance group.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --instance-update-minimal-action=INSTANCE_UPDATE_MINIMAL_ACTION; default="none"
        Perform at least this action on the instance while updating, if
        --update-instance is set to true. INSTANCE_UPDATE_MINIMAL_ACTION must
        be one of:

         none
            No action
         refresh
            Apply the new configuration without stopping VMs, if possible. For
            example, use ``refresh`` to apply changes that only affect metadata
            or additional disks.
         restart
            Apply the new configuration without replacing VMs, if possible. For
            example, stopping VMs and starting them again is sufficient to
            apply changes to machine type.
         replace
            Replace old VMs according to the --replacement-method flag.

     --stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[source=SOURCE]
        Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Managed instance
        groups preserve and reattach stateful disks on VM autohealing, update,
        and recreate events.

        You can also attach and preserve disks, not defined in the group's
        instance template, to a given instance.

        The same disk can be attached to more than one instance but only in
        read-only mode.

            Use this argument multiple times to attach and preserve multiple disks.

         device-name
            Name under which disk is or will be attached.

         source
            Optional argument used to specify the URI of an existing persistent
            disk to attach under specified device-name.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk to attach. Supported options are ro
            for read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted when source is
            specified, rw is used as a default. mode can only be specified if
            source is given.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Specifies the auto deletion policy of the stateful disk.
            The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete this disk. Instead, detach the
              disk when its instance is deleted.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the stateful disk when
              the instance that it's attached to is permanently deleted from
              the group; for example, when the instance is deleted manually or
              when the group size is decreased.

     --stateful-external-ip=[address=ADDRESS],[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]
        Managed instance groups preserve stateful IPs on VM autohealing,
        update, and recreate events.

        You can preserve the IP address that's specified in a network interface
        for a specific managed instance, even if that network interface is not
        defined in the group's instance template.

        Use this argument multiple times to attach and preserve multiple IPs.

         interface-name
            (Optional) Network interface name. If omitted, the default network
            interface named nic0 is assumed.

                *address*::: Static IP address to assign to the instance in one of
                the following formats:

        + Address: URL of a static IP address reservation. For example:
        projects/example-project/regions/us-east1/addresses/example-ip-name.

        + Literal: For example: 130.211.181.55.

        If the provided IP address is not yet reserved, the managed instance
        group automatically creates the corresponding IP address reservation.
        If the provided IP address is reserved, the group assigns the
        reservation to the instance.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Prescribes what should happen to an associated static
            Address resource when a VM instance is permanently deleted.
            Regardless of the value of the delete rule, stateful IP addresses
            are always preserved on instance autohealing, update, and
            recreation operations. The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete the static IP address. Instead,
              unassign the address when its instance is permanently deleted and
              keep the address reserved.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the static IP address
              reservation when the instance that it's assigned to is
              permanently deleted from the instance group; for example, when
              the instance is deleted manually or when the group size is
              decreased.

     --stateful-internal-ip=[address=ADDRESS],[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]
        Managed instance groups preserve stateful IPs on VM autohealing,
        update, and recreate events.

        You can preserve the IP address that's specified in a network interface
        for a specific managed instance, even if that network interface is not
        defined in the group's instance template.

        Use this argument multiple times to attach and preserve multiple IPs.

         interface-name
            (Optional) Network interface name. If omitted, the default network
            interface named nic0 is assumed.

                *address*::: Static IP address to assign to the instance in one of
                the following formats:

        + Address: URL of a static IP address reservation. For example:
        projects/example-project/regions/us-east1/addresses/example-ip-name.

        + Literal: For example: 130.211.181.55.

        If the provided IP address is not yet reserved, the managed instance
        group automatically creates the corresponding IP address reservation.
        If the provided IP address is reserved, the group assigns the
        reservation to the instance.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Prescribes what should happen to an associated static
            Address resource when a VM instance is permanently deleted.
            Regardless of the value of the delete rule, stateful IP addresses
            are always preserved on instance autohealing, update, and
            recreation operations. The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete the static IP address. Instead,
              unassign the address when its instance is permanently deleted and
              keep the address reserved.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the static IP address
              reservation when the instance that it's assigned to is
              permanently deleted from the instance group; for example, when
              the instance is deleted manually or when the group size is
              decreased.

     --stateful-metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Additional metadata to be made available to the guest operating system
        in addition to the metadata defined in the instance template.

        Stateful metadata may be used to define a key/value pair specific for
        the one given instance to differentiate it from the other instances in
        the managed instance group.

        Stateful metadata key/value pairs are preserved on instance recreation,
        autohealing, updates, and any other lifecycle transitions of the
        instance.

        Stateful metadata have priority over the metadata defined in the
        instance template. This means that stateful metadata that is defined
        for a key that already exists in the instance template overrides the
        instance template value.

        Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an equals sign.
        Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in length.
        Multiple entries can be passed to this flag, e.g., --stateful-metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3.

     --update-instance
        Apply the configuration changes immediately to the instance. If you
        disable this flag, the managed instance group will apply the
        configuration update when you next recreate or update the instance.

        Example: say you have an instance with a disk attached to it and you
        created a stateful configuration for the disk. If you decide to delete
        the stateful configuration for the disk and you provide this flag, the
        group immediately refreshes the instance and removes the stateful
        configuration for the disk. Similarly if you have attached a new disk
        or changed its definition, with this flag the group immediately
        refreshes the instance with the new configuration.

        Enabled by default, use --no-update-instance to disable.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to create a per-instance config
          for. If not specified, you might be prompted to select a region
          (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to create a per-instance config
          for. If not specified, you might be prompted to select a zone
          (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed instance-configs create

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed instance-configs create
