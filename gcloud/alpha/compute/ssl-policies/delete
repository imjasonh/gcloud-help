NAME
    gcloud alpha compute ssl-policies delete - delete Compute Engine SSL
        policies

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute ssl-policies delete SSL_POLICY [SSL_POLICY ...]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute ssl-policies delete is used to delete one or
    more Compute Engine SSL policies. SSL policies can only be deleted when no
    other resources (e.g., Target HTTPS proxies, Target SSL proxies) refer to
    them.

    An SSL policy specifies the server-side support for SSL features. An SSL
    policy can be attached to a TargetHttpsProxy or a TargetSslProxy. This
    affects connections between clients and the HTTPS or SSL proxy load
    balancer. SSL policies do not affect the connection between the load
    balancers and the backends.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SSL_POLICY [SSL_POLICY ...]
        Names of the SSL policies to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the SSL policies are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the SSL policies to delete. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute ssl-policies delete

        $ gcloud beta compute ssl-policies delete
