NAME
    gcloud alpha compute ssl-policies create - create a new Compute Engine SSL
        policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute ssl-policies create SSL_POLICY
        [--custom-features=[CUSTOM_FEATURES,...]] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--min-tls-version=MIN_TLS_VERSION; default="1.0"]
        [--profile=PROFILE; default="COMPATIBLE"] [--global | --region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute ssl-policies create creates a new SSL policy.

    An SSL policy specifies the server-side support for SSL features. An SSL
    policy can be attached to a TargetHttpsProxy or a TargetSslProxy. This
    affects connections between clients and the HTTPS or SSL proxy load
    balancer. SSL policies do not affect the connection between the load
    balancers and the backends.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SSL_POLICY
        Name of the SSL policy to create.

FLAGS
     --custom-features=[CUSTOM_FEATURES,...]
        A comma-separated list of custom features, required when the profile
        being used is CUSTOM.

        Using CUSTOM profile allows customization of the features that are part
        of the SSL policy. This flag allows specifying those custom features.

        The list of all supported custom features can be obtained using:

            gcloud compute ssl-policies list-available-features

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the SSL policy.

     --min-tls-version=MIN_TLS_VERSION; default="1.0"
        Minimum TLS version. MIN_TLS_VERSION must be one of:

         1.0
            TLS 1.0.
         1.1
            TLS 1.1.
         1.2
            TLS 1.2.

     --profile=PROFILE; default="COMPATIBLE"
        SSL policy profile. Changing profile from CUSTOM to
        COMPATIBLE|MODERN|RESTRICTED will clear the custom-features field.
        PROFILE must be one of:

         COMPATIBLE
            Compatible profile. Allows the broadest set of clients, even those
            which support only out-of-date SSL features, to negotiate SSL with
            the load balancer.
         CUSTOM
            Custom profile. Allows customization by selecting only the features
            which are required. The list of all available features can be
            obtained using:

                gcloud compute ssl-policies list-available-features

         MODERN
            Modern profile. Supports a wide set of SSL features, allowing
            modern clients to negotiate SSL.
         RESTRICTED
            Restricted profile. Supports a reduced set of SSL features,
            intended to meet stricter compliance requirements.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the SSL policy is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the SSL policy to create. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute ssl-policies create

        $ gcloud beta compute ssl-policies create
