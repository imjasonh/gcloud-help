DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute vpn-tunnels create is used to create a Classic
    VPN tunnel between a target VPN gateway in Google Cloud Platform and a peer
    address; or create Highly Available VPN tunnel between HA VPN gateway and
    another HA VPN gateway, or Highly Available VPN tunnel between HA VPN
    gateway and an external VPN gateway.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the VPN Tunnel to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --shared-secret=SHARED_SECRET

        the regular expression [ -~]+

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --peer-address=PEER_ADDRESS
          Valid IPV4 address representing the remote tunnel endpoint, the peer

          Classic Target VPN gateway

       --peer-external-gateway=PEER_EXTERNAL_GATEWAY
          Peer side external VPN gateway representing the remote tunnel
          endpoint, this flag is used when creating HA VPN tunnels from Google

          Reference to the peer side Highly Available VPN gateway.

       --peer-gcp-gateway-region=PEER_GCP_GATEWAY_REGION
          Region of the VPN Gateway to operate on. Should be the same as
          region, if not specified, it will be automatically set. Overrides the
          default compute/region property value for this command invocation.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --target-vpn-gateway=TARGET_VPN_GATEWAY
          A reference to a Cloud VPN Classic Target VPN Gateway.

       --target-vpn-gateway-region=TARGET_VPN_GATEWAY_REGION
          Region of the Target VPN Gateway to operate on. Should be the same as
          region, if not specified, it will be automatically set. Overrides the
          default compute/region property value for this command invocation.

       --vpn-gateway=VPN_GATEWAY
          Reference to a Highly Available VPN gateway.

       --vpn-gateway-region=VPN_GATEWAY_REGION
          Region of the VPN Gateway to operate on. Should be the same as
          region, if not specified, it will be automatically set. Overrides the
          default compute/region property value for this command invocation.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --capacity-tier=CAPACITY_TIER
        The capacity tier of the VPN tunnel. This is used for IPsec over
        Interconnect tunnels to indicate different bandwidth limits.
        CAPACITY_TIER must be one of: DEFAULT, HIGH.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the VPN tunnel.

     --ike-version=IKE_VERSION
        Internet Key Exchange protocol version number. Default is 2.
        IKE_VERSION must be one of: 1, 2.

     --interface=INTERFACE
        Numeric interface ID of the VPN gateway with which this VPN tunnel is
        associated. This flag is required if the tunnel is being attached to a
        Highly Available VPN gateway. This option is only available for use
        with Highly Available VPN gateway and must be omitted if the tunnel is
        going to be connected to a Classic VPN gateway. INTERFACE must be one
        of: 0, 1.

     --local-traffic-selector=CIDR,[CIDR,...]
        Traffic selector is an agreement between IKE peers to permit traffic
        through a tunnel if the traffic matches a specified pair of local and
        remote addresses.

        --local-traffic-selector allows to configure the local addresses that
        are permitted. The value should be a comma separated list of CIDR
        formatted strings. Example: 192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/24.

        Local traffic selector must be specified only for VPN tunnels that do
        not use dynamic routing with a Cloud Router. Omit this flag when
        creating a tunnel using dynamic routing, including a tunnel for a
        Highly Available VPN gateway.

     --peer-external-gateway-interface=PEER_EXTERNAL_GATEWAY_INTERFACE
        Interface ID of the external VPN gateway to which this VPN tunnel is
        connected to. This flag is required if the tunnel is being created from
        a Highly Available VPN gateway to an External Vpn Gateway.
        PEER_EXTERNAL_GATEWAY_INTERFACE must be one of: 0, 1, 2, 3.

     --phase1-dh=GROUPS,[GROUPS,...]
        Phase 1 Diffie-Hellman groups.

     --phase1-encryption=ALGORITHMS,[ALGORITHMS,...]
        Phase 1 encryption algorithms.

     --phase1-integrity=ALGORITHMS,[ALGORITHMS,...]
        Phase 1 integrity algorithms.

     --phase1-prf=PSEUDORANDOM FUNCTIONS,[...]
        Phase 1 pseudorandom functions.

     --phase2-encryption=ALGORITHMS,[ALGORITHMS,...]
        Phase 2 encryption algorithms.

     --phase2-integrity=ALGORITHMS,[ALGORITHMS,...]
        Phase 2 integrity algorithms.

     --phase2-pfs=ALGORITHMS,[ALGORITHMS,...]
        Phase 2 perfect forward secerecy algorithms.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the VPN Tunnel to create. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --remote-traffic-selector=CIDR,[CIDR,...]
        Traffic selector is an agreement between IKE peers to permit traffic
        through a tunnel if the traffic matches a specified pair of local and
        remote addresses.

        --remote-traffic-selector allows to configure the remote addresses that
        are permitted. The value should be a comma separated list of CIDR
        formatted strings. Example: 192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/24.

        Remote traffic selector must be specified for VPN tunnels that do not
        use dynamic routing with a Cloud Router. Omit this flag when creating a
        tunnel using dynamic routing, including a tunnel for a Highly Available
        VPN gateway.

     --resource-manager-tags=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A comma-separated list of Resource Manager tags to apply to the VPN
        tunnel.

     --router=ROUTER
        Router to use for dynamic routing.

     --router-region=ROUTER_REGION
        Region of the router to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create

        $ gcloud beta compute vpn-tunnels create
