NAME
    gcloud alpha compute public-delegated-prefixes delegated-sub-prefixes
        delete - deletes a Compute Engine delegated sub prefix

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute public-delegated-prefixes delegated-sub-prefixes
        delete NAME --public-delegated-prefix=PUBLIC_DELEGATED_PREFIX
        [--global-public-delegated-prefix
          | --public-delegated-prefix-region=PUBLIC_DELEGATED_PREFIX_REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deletes a Compute Engine delegated sub prefix.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a delegated sub prefix for a global public delegated prefix:

        $ gcloud alpha compute public-delegated-prefixes \
            delegated-sub-prefixes delete my-sub-prefix \
            --public-delegated-prefix=my-pdp \
            --global-public-delegated-prefix

    To delete a delegated sub prefix for a regional public delegated prefix:

        $ gcloud alpha compute public-delegated-prefixes \
            delegated-sub-prefixes delete my-sub-prefix \
            --public-delegated-prefix=my-pdp \
            --public-delegated-prefix-region=us-east1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the delegated sub prefix to delete.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --public-delegated-prefix=PUBLIC_DELEGATED_PREFIX
        Name of the public delegated prefix to delete the delegate sub prefix
        for.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global-public-delegated-prefix
          If set, the public delegated prefix is global.

       --public-delegated-prefix-region=PUBLIC_DELEGATED_PREFIX_REGION
          Region of the public delegated prefix to delete the delegate sub
          prefix for. If not specified, you might be prompted to select a
          region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute public-delegated-prefixes delegated-sub-prefixes \
            delete

        $ gcloud beta compute public-delegated-prefixes \
            delegated-sub-prefixes delete
