DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute networks list-ip-owners is used to list IP
    owners in a network.

EXAMPLES
    List all IP owners in a network:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks list-ip-owners my-network

    List IP owners only for given owner types:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks list-ip-owners my-network \
            --owner-types=instance,address,forwardingRule

    List IP owners only for given owner projects:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks list-ip-owners my-network \
            --owner-projects=p1,p2

    List IP owners only for given subnet:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks list-ip-owners my-network \
            --subnet-name=subnet-1 --subnet-region=us-central1

    List IP owners whose IP ranges overlap with the given IP CIDR range:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks list-ip-owners my-network \
            --ip-cidr-range=10.128.10.130/30

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the network.

FLAGS
     --ip-cidr-range=IP_CIDR_RANGE
        Only return IP owners whose IP ranges overlap with the IP CIDR range.

     --owner-projects=OWNER_PROJECTS
        Only return IP owners in the projects. Multiple projects are separated
        by comma, e.g., "project-1,project-2".

     --owner-types=OWNER_TYPES
        Only return IP owners of the types, which can be any combination of
        instance, address, forwardingRule, subnetwork, or network. Multiple
        types are separated by comma, e.g., "instance,forwardingRule,address"

     --subnet-name=SUBNET_NAME
        Only return IP owners in the subnets with the name. Not applicable for
        legacy networks.

     --subnet-region=SUBNET_REGION
        Only return IP owners in the subnets of the region. Not applicable for
        legacy networks.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
