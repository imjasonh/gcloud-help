NAME
    gcloud alpha compute networks update - update a Compute Engine network

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute networks update NAME [--async]
        [--[no-]enable-ula-internal-ipv6]
        [--internal-ipv6-range=INTERNAL_IPV6_RANGE] [--mtu=MTU]
        [--bgp-routing-mode=MODE | --switch-to-custom-subnet-mode]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute networks update is used to update Compute
    Engine networks.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network to operate on.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --[no-]enable-ula-internal-ipv6
        Enable/disable ULA internal IPv6 on this network. Enabling this feature
        will assign a /48 from google defined ULA prefix fd20::/20.

        Use --enable-ula-internal-ipv6 to enable and
        --no-enable-ula-internal-ipv6 to disable.

     --internal-ipv6-range=INTERNAL_IPV6_RANGE
        When enabling ULA internal IPv6, caller can optionally specify the /48
        range they want from the google defined ULA prefix fd20::/20.
        ULA_IPV6_RANGE must be a valid /48 ULA IPv6 address and within the
        fd20::/20. Operation will fail if the speficied /48 is already in used
        by another resource. If the field is not speficied, then a /48 range
        will be randomly allocated from fd20::/20 and returned via this field.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        that can be transmitted on this network. Default value is 1460 bytes,
        and the maximum is 1500 bytes. The MTU advertised via DHCP to all
        instances attached to this network.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --bgp-routing-mode=MODE
          The target BGP routing mode for this network. MODE must be one of:

           global
              Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from all
              regions to their BGP peers, and program instances in all regions
              with the router's best learned BGP routes.
           regional
              Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from their
              local region only to their BGP peers, and program instances in
              their local region only with the router's best learned BGP
              routes.

       --switch-to-custom-subnet-mode
          Switch to custom subnet mode. This action cannot be undone.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks update

        $ gcloud beta compute networks update
