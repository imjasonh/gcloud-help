NAME
    gcloud alpha compute networks subnets delete - delete Google Cloud
        subnetworks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute networks subnets delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute networks subnets delete deletes one or more
    Google Cloud subnetworks. Subnetworks can only be deleted when no other
    resources, such as VM instances, refer to them.".

EXAMPLES
    To delete the subnetwork subnet-1 in the us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks subnets delete subnet-1 \
            --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the subnetworks to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetworks to delete. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks subnets delete

        $ gcloud beta compute networks subnets delete
