NAME
    gcloud alpha compute networks subnets list-usable - list Compute Engine
        subnetworks permitted for use

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute networks subnets list-usable
        [--service-project=SERVICE_PROJECT] [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute networks subnets list-usable is used to list
    Compute Engine subnetworks in a project that the user has permission to
    use.

    By default, usable subnetworks are listed for the default Google Cloud
    project and user account. These values can be overridden by setting the
    global flags: --project=PROJECT_ID and/or --account=ACCOUNT.

EXAMPLES
    To list all subnetworks in the default project that are usable by the
    default user:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks subnets list-usable

    To list all subnetworks in the host project HOST_PROJECT_ID of Shared VPC
    that are usable in the service project SERVICE_PROJECT_ID (see Shared VPC
    documentation (https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc/)) by the
    default user:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks subnets list-usable \
            --project=HOST_PROJECT_ID --service-project=SERVICE_PROJECT_ID

    To list all subnetworks in the project PROJECT_ID that are usable by the
    user ACCOUNT:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks subnets list-usable \
            --project=PROJECT_ID --account=ACCOUNT

FLAGS
     --service-project=SERVICE_PROJECT
        The project id or project number in which the subnetwork is intended to
        be used. Only applied for Shared VPC. See Shared VPC documentation
        (https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc/).

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks subnets list-usable

        $ gcloud beta compute networks subnets list-usable
