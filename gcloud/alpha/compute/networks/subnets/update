DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute networks subnets update is used to update
    properties of an existing Compute Engine subnetwork.

EXAMPLES
    To enable external IPv6 addresses on the subnetwork example-subnet-1 in
    network-1, run

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks subnets update example-subnet-1 \
            --stack-type=IPV4_IPV6 --ipv6-access-type=EXTERNAL \
            --region=REGION

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the subnetwork to update.

FLAGS
     --add-secondary-ranges-with-reserved-internal-range=RANGE_NAME=INTERNAL_RANGE_URL,[...]
        Adds secondary IP ranges that are associated with InternalRange
        resources.

        For example, --add-secondary-ranges-with-reserved-internal-range
        range1=//networkconnectivity.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT/locations/global/internalRanges/RANGE
        adds a secondary range with the reserved internal range resource.

        ◆ RANGE_NAME - Name of the secondary range.
        ◆ INTERNAL_RANGE_URL - URL of an InternalRange resource.

     --aggregation-interval=AGGREGATION_INTERVAL
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Toggles the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs. Increasing
        the interval time will reduce the amount of generated flow logs for
        long lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds per
        connection. AGGREGATION_INTERVAL must be one of: interval-10-min,
        interval-15-min, interval-1-min, interval-30-sec, interval-5-min,
        interval-5-sec.

     --drain-timeout=DRAIN_TIMEOUT; default="0s"
        The time period for draining traffic from Internal HTTP(S) Load
        Balancer proxies that are assigned addresses in the current ACTIVE
        subnetwork. For example, 1h, 60m and 3600s each specify a duration of 1
        hour for draining the traffic. Longer times reduce the number of
        proxies that are draining traffic at any one time, and so improve the
        availability of proxies for load balancing. The drain timeout is only
        applicable when the [--role=ACTIVE] flag is being used.

     --external-ipv6-prefix=EXTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX
        Set external IPv6 prefix to be allocated for this subnetwork.

        For example, --external-ipv6-prefix 2600:1901:0:0:0:0:0:0/64

     --flow-sampling=FLOW_SAMPLING
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling rate of VPC
        Flow Logs within the subnetwork where 1.0 means all collected logs are
        reported and 0.0 means no logs are reported. Default is 0.5 which means
        half of all collected logs are reported.

     --ipv6-access-type=IPV6_ACCESS_TYPE
        IPv6 access type can be specified only when the subnet is created, or
        when the subnet is first updated to have a stack type of IPV4_IPV6.
        Once set, the access type is immutable. IPV6_ACCESS_TYPE must be one
        of:

         EXTERNAL
            VMs in this subnet can have external IPv6.
         INTERNAL
            VMs in this subnet can have internal IPv6.

     --logging-aggregation-interval=LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Toggles the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs. Increasing
        the interval time will reduce the amount of generated flow logs for
        long lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds per
        connection. LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL must be one of:
        interval-10-min, interval-15-min, interval-1-min, interval-30-sec,
        interval-5-min, interval-5-sec.

     --logging-filter-expr=LOGGING_FILTER_EXPR
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Export filter used to define which logs should be generated.

     --logging-flow-sampling=LOGGING_FLOW_SAMPLING
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling rate of VPC
        flow logs within the subnetwork where 1.0 means all collected logs are
        reported and 0.0 means no logs are reported. Default is 0.5 which means
        half of all collected logs are reported.

     --logging-metadata=LOGGING_METADATA
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the reported
        logs. Default is to exclude all metadata. LOGGING_METADATA must be one
        of: custom, exclude-all, include-all.

     --logging-metadata-fields=[METADATA_FIELD,...]
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled
        and "metadata" is set to CUSTOM_METADATA. The comma-separated list of
        metadata fields that should be added to reported logs.

     --metadata=METADATA
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the reported
        logs. Default is to exclude all metadata. METADATA must be one of:
        exclude-all-metadata, include-all-metadata.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to update. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        The stack type for this subnet. Determines if IPv6 is enabled on the
        subnet. STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            New VMs in this subnet can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
         IPV4_ONLY
            New VMs in this subnet will only be assigned IPv4 addresses

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --add-secondary-ranges=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]
          Adds secondary IP ranges to the subnetwork for use in IP aliasing.

          For example, --add-secondary-ranges range1=192.168.64.0/24 adds a
          secondary range 192.168.64.0/24 with name range1.

          ▸ RANGE_NAME - Name of the secondary range.
          ▸ RANGE - IP range in CIDR format.

       --[no-]allow-cidr-routes-overlap
          Allow/disallow this subnetwork's IP address ranges to conflict with
          existing static routes. Use --allow-cidr-routes-overlap to enable and
          --no-allow-cidr-routes-overlap to disable.

       --[no-]enable-flow-logs
          Enable/disable VPC Flow Logs for this subnet. If the subnet does not
          support VPC Flow Logs, this flag has no effect. For more information,
          see https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-flow-logs. Use
          --enable-flow-logs to enable and --no-enable-flow-logs to disable.

       --[no-]enable-private-ip-google-access
          Enable/disable access to Google Cloud APIs from this subnet for
          instances without a public ip address. Use
          --enable-private-ip-google-access to enable and
          --no-enable-private-ip-google-access to disable.

       --private-ipv6-google-access-type=PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE
          The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs in this subnet.
          PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of: disable,
          enable-bidirectional-access, enable-outbound-vm-access.

       --purpose=PURPOSE
          The purpose of the subnetwork is set to REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY to
          migrate from the INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER purpose. PURPOSE must
          be (only one value is supported):

           REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY
              The proxy-only subnet for regional HTTP(S) load balancers.

       --remove-secondary-ranges=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]
          Removes secondary ranges from the subnetwork.

          For example, --remove-secondary-ranges range2,range3 removes the
          secondary ranges with names range2 and range3.

       --role=ROLE
          The role is set to ACTIVE to update a BACKUP reserved address range
          to be the new ACTIVE address range. Note that the only supported
          value for this flag is ACTIVE since setting an address range to
          BACKUP is not supported.

          This field is only valid when updating a reserved IP address range
          used for the purpose of Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancer.

          ROLE must be (only one value is supported):

           ACTIVE
              The ACTIVE subnet that is currently used.
