NAME
    gcloud alpha compute networks subnets describe - describe a Compute Engine
        subnetwork

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute networks subnets describe NAME [--region=REGION]
        [--view=VIEW] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute networks subnets describe displays all data
    associated with a Compute Engine subnetwork.

EXAMPLES
    To display all data associated with subnetwork subnet-1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks subnets describe subnet-1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the subnetwork to describe.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to describe. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --view=VIEW
        Specifies the information to include in the output. VIEW must be (only
        one value is supported):

         WITH_UTILIZATION
            Output includes the IP address utilization data of all subnetwork
            ranges, showing total allocated and free IPv4 and IPv6 IP
            addresses.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks subnets describe

        $ gcloud beta compute networks subnets describe
