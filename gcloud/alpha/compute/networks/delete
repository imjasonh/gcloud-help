        $ gcloud alpha compute networks delete network-name

    To delete two networks with the names 'network-name1' and 'network-name2',
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks delete network-name1 network-name2

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks delete

        $ gcloud beta compute networks delete
