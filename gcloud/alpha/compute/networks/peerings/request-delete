NAME
    gcloud alpha compute networks peerings request-delete - request deletion of
        a Compute Engine network peering

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute networks peerings request-delete NAME
        --network=NETWORK [--async] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute networks peerings request-delete is used to
    request deletion of a consensus peering between virtual networks. The
    peering can be deleted if both sides request deletion.

EXAMPLES
    To request deletion of a consensus peering with the name 'peering-name'
    between the network 'local-network' and the network 'peer-network', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks peerings request-delete \
          peering-name --network=local-network

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks peerings request-delete \
          peering-name --network=peer-network

    To complete the deletion, run gcloud alpha compute networks peerings delete
    for each side of the peering.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the peering.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The name of the network in the current project containing the peering.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
