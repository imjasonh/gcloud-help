NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instant-snapshot-groups delete - delete a Compute
        Engine instant snapshot group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instant-snapshot-groups delete
        INSTANT_SNAPSHOT_GROUP_NAME [INSTANT_SNAPSHOT_GROUP_NAME ...]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a Compute Engine instant snapshot group.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANT_SNAPSHOT_GROUP_NAME [INSTANT_SNAPSHOT_GROUP_NAME ...]
        Names of the instant snapshot groups to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the instant snapshot groups to delete. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the instant snapshot groups to delete. If not specified and
          the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select
          a zone (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute instant-snapshot-groups delete
