NAME
    gcloud alpha composer - create and manage Cloud Composer Environments

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha composer GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Cloud Composer is a managed Apache Airflow service that helps you
    create, schedule, monitor and manage workflows. Cloud Composer automation
    helps you create Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow-native tools,
    such as the powerful Airflow web interface and command line tools, so you
    can focus on your workflows and not your infrastructure.

        $ gcloud alpha composer environments --help

    To see how to manage long-running operations, run:

        $ gcloud alpha composer operations --help

    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
