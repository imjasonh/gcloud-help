NAME
    gcloud alpha composer environments storage data export - export data from
        an environment into local storage or Cloud Storage

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha composer environments storage data export
        --destination=DESTINATION
        (--environment=ENVIRONMENT : --location=LOCATION) [--source=SOURCE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) If the SOURCE is a directory, it and its contents are are exported
    recursively. If no SOURCE is provided, the entire contents of the
    environment's data directory will be exported. Colliding files in the
    DESTINATION will be overwritten. If a file exists in the DESTINATION but
    there is no corresponding file to overwrite it, it is untouched.

EXAMPLES
    Suppose the environment myenv's Cloud Storage bucket has the following
    structure:

        gs://the-bucket
        |
        +-- data
        |   |
        |   +-- file1.txt
        |   +-- file2.txt
        |   |
        |   +-- subdir1
        |   |   |
        |   |   +-- file3.txt
        |   |   +-- file4.txt

    And the local directory '/foo' has the following structure:

        /foo
        |
        +-- file1.txt
        +-- fileX.txt
        |   |
        |   +-- subdir1
        |   |   |
        |   |   +-- file3.txt
        |   |   +-- fileY.txt

    The following command:

        gcloud alpha composer environments storage data export myenv --destination=/foo

    would result in the following structure in the local '/foo' directory:

        /foo
        |
        +-- file1.txt
        +-- file2.txt
        +-- fileX.txt
        |   |
        |   +-- subdir1
        |   |   |
        |   |   +-- file3.txt
        |   |   +-- file4.txt
        |   |   +-- fileY.txt

    The local files '/foo/file1.txt' and '/foo/subdir1/file3.txt' will be
    overwritten with the contents of the corresponding files in the Cloud
    Storage bucket.

    If instead we had run

        gcloud alpha composer environments storage data export myenv --source=subdir1/file3.txt --destination=/foo

    the resulting local directory structure would be the following:

        /foo
        |
        +-- file1.txt
        +-- file3.txt
        +-- fileX.txt
        |   |
        |   +-- subdir1
        |   |   |
        |   |   +-- file3.txt
        |   |   +-- fileY.txt

    No local files would be overwritten since
    'gs://the-bucket/dags/subdir1/file3.txt' was written to '/foo/file3.txt'
    instead of 'foo/subdir1/file3.txt'.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --destination=DESTINATION
        The path to an existing local directory or a Cloud Storage
        bucket/directory into which to export files.

     Environment resource - The environment from whose Cloud Storage bucket to
     export data.. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --environment on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       --environment=ENVIRONMENT
          ID of the environment or fully qualified identifier for the
          environment. To set the environment attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --environment on the command line.

          This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Compute Engine region in which to create the environment. To set the
          location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --environment on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property composer/location.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --source=SOURCE
        An optional relative path to a file or directory to be exported from
        the data/ subdirectory in the environment's Cloud Storage bucket.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud composer environments storage data export

        $ gcloud beta composer environments storage data export
