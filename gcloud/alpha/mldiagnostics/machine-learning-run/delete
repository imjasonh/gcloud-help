NAME
    gcloud alpha mldiagnostics machine-learning-run delete - delete a machine
        learning run

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha mldiagnostics machine-learning-run delete
        (MACHINE_LEARNING_RUN : --location=LOCATION) [--async] [--force]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a machine learning run.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the machine learning run, run:

        $ gcloud alpha mldiagnostics machine-learning-run delete my-run \
          --location=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Machine learning run resource -
     projects/{project}/locations/{location}/machineLearningRuns/{machineLearningRun}
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument machine_learning_run on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       MACHINE_LEARNING_RUN
          ID of the machine_learning_run or fully qualified identifier for the
          machine_learning_run.

          To set the machine_learning_run attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument machine_learning_run on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the machine_learning_run resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument machine_learning_run on the command line
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/region.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --force
        If force=false and if a user tries to delete an ml run resource that
        still has child resources (e.g., ProfilerTarget), the request should
        fail with a FAILED_PRECONDITION error. If force=true, the delete
        request should delete both parent and child resources that exist.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the hypercomputecluster/v1alpha API. The full
    documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://docs.cloud.google.com/cluster-director/docs

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
