NAME
    gcloud alpha service-extensions wasm-plugins update - update a WasmPlugin

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha service-extensions wasm-plugins update
        (WASM_PLUGIN : --location=LOCATION) [--async]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--log-config=[LOG_CONFIG,...]]
        [--image=IMAGE
          --main-version=MAIN_VERSION --plugin-config=PLUGIN_CONFIG
          | --plugin-config-file=PLUGIN_CONFIG_FILE
          | --plugin-config-uri=PLUGIN_CONFIG_URI] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an existing WasmPlugin and optionally create a
    WasmPluginVersion and set it as main (serving) one.

    If --image is not specified:
      ▪ the method only updates the WasmPlugin resource without creating a
        WasmPluginVersion.
      ▪ the --plugin-config** flags are disallowed.
      ▪ if --main-version is set, then the referenced WasmPluginVersion must
        already exists and it will be set as main (serving) one.

    If --image is specified:
      ▪ the --main-version flag should also be specified.
      ▪ the method updates the WasmPlugin resource and creates a new
        WasmPluginVersion with --main-version name and sets it as main
        (serving) one.
      ▪ the --plugin-config** flags are allowed.
      ▪ the --async flag is disallowed.

EXAMPLES
    To update a WasmPlugin called my-plugin, run:

        $ gcloud alpha service-extensions wasm-plugins update my-plugin \
            --main-version=new-version --description="A new description." \
            --labels=label1=value1

    To update a WasmPlugin called my-plugin and also create a new version
    called v1 and set it as main:

        $ gcloud alpha service-extensions wasm-plugins update my-plugin \
            --main-version=v1 --description="A new description." \
            --labels=label1=value1 \
            --image=...-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/repository/container:tag

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     WasmPlugin resource - The ID of the WasmPlugin to update. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument wasm_plugin on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       WASM_PLUGIN
          ID of the WasmPlugin or fully qualified identifier for the
          WasmPlugin.

          To set the wasm_plugin attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument wasm_plugin on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location Id.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument wasm_plugin on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ use global location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Provides an optional, human-readable description of the service.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --log-config=[LOG_CONFIG,...]
        Logging options for the activity performed by this WasmPlugin.
        Following options can be set:
        ◆ enable - whether to enable logging. If log-config flag is set,
          enable option is required.

        ◆ sample-rate - configures the sampling rate of activity logs, where
          1.0 means all logged activity is reported and 0.0 means no activity
          is reported. The default value is 1.0, and the value of the field
          must be in [0, 1].

        ◆ min-log-level - specificies the lowest level of the logs which
          should be exported to Cloud Logging. The default value is INFO.

        Example usage:
        --log-config=enable=True,sample-rate=0.5,min-log-level=INFO
        --log_config=enable=False

     --image=IMAGE
        URI of the container image containing the Wasm module, stored in the
        Artifact Registry.

     --main-version=MAIN_VERSION
        The ID of the WasmPluginVersion that should be the currently serving
        one. The version referred to must be a child of this WasmPlugin.

        If the --image flag was also provided, the WasmPluginVersion will be
        created for that WasmPlugin and will be set as the current main
        version.

     Configuration for the WasmPlugin, provided to the plugin at runtime via
     the proxy_on_configure call (the exact name of the invoked function
     depends on the Proxy-Wasm SDK used).

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --plugin-config=PLUGIN_CONFIG
          WasmPlugin configuration in the textual format.

       --plugin-config-file=PLUGIN_CONFIG_FILE
          Path to a local file containing the plugin configuration.

       --plugin-config-uri=PLUGIN_CONFIG_URI
          URI of the container image containing the plugin configuration,
          stored in the Artifact Registry.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
