NAME
    gcloud alpha functions upgrade - upgrade a 1st gen Cloud Function to the
        2nd gen environment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha functions upgrade (NAME : --region=REGION)
        [--abort | --commit | --redirect-traffic | --rollback-traffic
          | --setup-config] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Upgrade a 1st gen Cloud Function to the 2nd gen environment.

EXAMPLES
    To start the upgrade process for a 1st gen function foo and create a 2nd
    gen function copy, run:

        $ gcloud alpha functions upgrade foo

    Once you are ready to redirect production traffic to the 2nd gen function
    copy, run:

        $ gcloud alpha functions upgrade foo --redirect-traffic

    If you find you need to do more local testing you can rollback production
    traffic to the 1st gen function copy:

        $ gcloud alpha functions upgrade foo --rollback-traffic

    Once you're ready to finish upgrading and delete the 1st gen function copy,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha functions upgrade foo --commit

    You can abort the generation upgrade process at any time by running:

        $ gcloud alpha functions upgrade foo --abort

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Function resource - The Cloud function name to upgrade. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument NAME on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       NAME
          ID of the function or fully qualified identifier for the function.

          To set the function attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument NAME on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud region for the function. Overrides the default
          functions/region property value for this command invocation.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument NAME on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property functions/region.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --abort
          Undoes all steps of the upgrade process done so far. All traffic will
          point to the original 1st gen function copy and the 2nd gen function
          copy will be deleted.

       --commit
          Finishes the upgrade process and permanently deletes the original 1st
          gen copy of the function.

       --redirect-traffic
          Redirects production traffic to the 2nd gen copy of the function.

       --rollback-traffic
          Rolls back production traffic to the original 1st gen copy of the
          function. The 2nd gen copy will still be available for testing.

       --setup-config
          Sets up the function upgrade config by creating a 2nd gen copy of the
          function's code and configuration. This is the default action.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
