NAME
    gcloud alpha resource-settings - create and manage Resource Settings

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha resource-settings COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The gcloud Resource Settings command group lets you create and
    manipulate resource settings.

    The Resource Settings Service is a hierarchy-aware service with a
    public-facing API for users to store settings that modify the behavior of
    their Google Cloud Platform resources, such as virtual machines, firewalls,
    projects, and so forth. Settings can be attached to organizations, folders,
    and projects, and can influence these resources as well as service
    resources that are descendants of the resource to which the settings are
    attached.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
