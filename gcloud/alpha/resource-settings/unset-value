DESCRIPTION

            net-preferredDnsServers --project=foo-project

        fetched using the list command: $ gcloud resource-settings list

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Resource that is associated with the resource settings.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder ID.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization ID.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project ID. Overrides the default core/project property value for
          this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud resource-settings unset-value
