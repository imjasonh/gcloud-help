     --database-flags=FLAG=VALUE,[FLAG=VALUE,...]
        Comma-separated list of database flags to set on the instance. Use an
        equals sign to separate flag name and value. Flags without values, like
        skip_grant_tables, can be written out without a value after, e.g.,
        skip_grant_tables=. Use on/off for booleans. View the Instance Resource
        API for allowed flags. (e.g., --database-flags

        Which channel's updates to apply during the maintenance window. If not
        specified, Cloud SQL chooses the timing of updates to your instance.
        MAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL must be one of:

         preview
            Preview updates release prior to production updates. You may wish
            to use the preview channel for dev/test applications so that you
            can preview their compatibility with your application prior to the
            production release.

        units are specified, GiB is assumed. Both --cpu and --memory must be
        specified if a custom machine type is desired, and the --tier flag must
        be omitted.

     --network=NETWORK
        Network in the current project that the instance will be part of. To
        specify using a network with a shared VPC, use the full URL of the
        network. For an example host project, 'testproject', and shared
        network, 'testsharednetwork', this would use the form:
        --network=projects/testproject/global/networks/testsharednetwork

     --password-policy-complexity=PASSWORD_POLICY_COMPLEXITY
        The complexity of the password. This flag is available only for

        2m for 2 minutes. See <a href="/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/datetimes">
        $ gcloud topic datetimes</a> for information on duration formats. This
        flag is available only for PostgreSQL.

     --password-policy-reuse-interval=PASSWORD_POLICY_REUSE_INTERVAL
        Number of previous passwords that cannot be reused. The valid range is
        0 to 100.

     --[no-]recreate-replicas-on-primary-crash
        Allow/Disallow replica recreation when a primary MySQL instance
        operating in reduced durability mode crashes. Not recreating the
        replicas might lead to data inconsistencies between the primary and its
        replicas. This setting is only applicable for MySQL instances and is
        enabled by default. Use --recreate-replicas-on-primary-crash to enable
        and --no-recreate-replicas-on-primary-crash to disable.

     --replica-type=REPLICA_TYPE
        The type of replica to create. REPLICA_TYPE must be one of: READ,
        FAILOVER.

     --retained-transaction-log-days=RETAINED_TRANSACTION_LOG_DAYS
        How many days of transaction logs to keep. The valid range is between 1
        and 35. Only use this option when point-in-time recovery is enabled. If
        logs are stored on disk, storage size for transaction logs could
        increase when the number of days for log retention increases. For
        Enterprise, default and max retention values are 7 and 7 respectively.
        For Enterprise_Plus, default and max retention values are 14 and 35.

     --root-password=ROOT_PASSWORD
        Root Cloud SQL user's password.

     --[no-]storage-auto-increase
        Storage size can be increased, but it cannot be decreased; storage
        increases are permanent for the life of the instance. With this setting
        enabled, a spike in storage requirements can result in permanently
        increased storage costs for your instance. However, if an instance runs
        out of available space, it can result in the instance going offline,
        dropping existing connections. This setting is enabled by default. Use
        --storage-auto-increase to enable and --no-storage-auto-increase to
        disable.

     --storage-auto-increase-limit=STORAGE_AUTO_INCREASE_LIMIT
        Allows you to set a maximum storage capacity, in GB. Automatic
        increases to your capacity will stop once this limit has been reached.
        Default capacity is unlimited.

     --storage-size=STORAGE_SIZE
        Amount of storage allocated to the instance. Must be an integer number
        of GB. The default is 10GB. Information on storage limits can be found

        Server instances.

     --tier=TIER, -t TIER
        Machine type for a shared-core instance e.g. db-g1-small. For all other
        instances, instead of using tiers, customize your instance by
        specifying its CPU and memory. You can do so with the --cpu and
        --memory flags. Learn more about how CPU and memory affects pricing:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing.

     --time-zone=TIME_ZONE
        Set a non-default time zone. Only available for SQL Server instances.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default=3600
