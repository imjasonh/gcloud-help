NAME
    gcloud alpha sql instances import - imports data into a Cloud SQL instance
        from Google Cloud Storage

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha sql instances import INSTANCE URI [--async]
        [--database=DATABASE, -d DATABASE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) Imports data into a Cloud SQL instance from Google
    Cloud Storage.

    This command is deprecated and will be removed in version 205.0.0. Use
    gcloud sql import sql instead.

    Note: authorization is required. For more information on importing data
    into Google Cloud SQL see
    https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/import-export/importing.

    Cloud SQL supports importing CSV files and SQL dump files from both MySQL
    and PostgreSQL. For more information on how to create these export formats,
    see
    https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/import-export/creating-sqldump-csv

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID.

     URI
        Path to the MySQL dump file in Google Cloud Storage from which the
        import is made. The URI is in the form gs://bucketName/fileName.
        Compressed gzip files (.gz) are also supported.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --database=DATABASE, -d DATABASE
        Database to which the import is made. If not set, it is assumed that
        the database is specified in the file to be imported. If your SQL dump
        file includes a database statement, it will override the database set
        in this flag.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud sql instances import

        $ gcloud beta sql instances import
