NAME
    gcloud alpha sql export sql - exports data from a Cloud SQL instance to a
        SQL file

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha sql export sql INSTANCE URI [--async] [--clean]
        [--database=DATABASE,[DATABASE,...], -d DATABASE,[DATABASE,...]]
        [--if-exists] [--offload] [--parallel]
        [--table=TABLE,[TABLE,...], -t TABLE,[TABLE,...]] [--threads=THREADS]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Exports data from a Cloud SQL instance to a Google Cloud Storage
    bucket as a SQL dump file.

    NOTE: Certain roles and permissions are required to export data to Google
    Cloud Storage. For more information on exporting data from Google Cloud SQL
    see Export from Cloud SQL to a SQL dump file
    (https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/import-export/import-export-sql#gcloud).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID.

     URI
        The path to the file in Google Cloud Storage where the export will be
        stored. The URI is in the form gs://bucketName/fileName. If the file
        already exists, the operation fails. If the filename ends with .gz, the
        contents are compressed.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --clean
        Include SQL statements (DROP <object>) required to drop database
        objects prior to import; corresponds to the clean flag for pg_dump.
        Only applies to PostgreSQL non-parallel exports.

     --database=DATABASE,[DATABASE,...], -d DATABASE,[DATABASE,...]
        Database(s) from which the export is made. Information on requirements
        can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api/v1beta4/instances/export#exportContext.databases

     --if-exists
        Include an SQL statement (IF EXISTS) with each drop statement produced
        by the clean flag; corresponds to the if-exists flag for pg_dump. Only
        applies to PostgreSQL non-parallel exports.

     --offload
        Offload an export to a temporary instance. Doing so reduces strain on
        source instances and allows other operations to be performed while the
        export is in progress.

     --parallel
        Perform a parallel export. This flag is only applicable to MySQL and
        Postgres.

     --table=TABLE,[TABLE,...], -t TABLE,[TABLE,...]
        Tables to export from the specified database. If you specify tables,
        specify one and only one database. For PostgreSQL instances, only one
        table can be exported at a time.

     --threads=THREADS
        Specifies the number of threads to use for the parallel export. If
        --parallel is specified and this flag is not provided, Cloud SQL uses a
        default thread count to optimize performance.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud sql export sql

        $ gcloud beta sql export sql
