        [--database=DATABASE,[DATABASE,...], -d DATABASE,[DATABASE,...]]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Exports data from a Cloud SQL instance to a Google Cloud Storage
    bucket as a plain text file with one line per row and comma-separated
    fields.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID.

     URI
        The path to the file in Google Cloud Storage where the export will be
        stored. The URI is in the form gs://bucketName/fileName. If the file
        already exists, the operation fails. If the filename ends with .gz, the
        contents are compressed.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --query=QUERY
        A SQL SELECT query (e.g., SELECT * FROM table) that specifies the data
        to export.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --database=DATABASE,[DATABASE,...], -d DATABASE,[DATABASE,...]
        Database(s) from which the export is made. Information on requirements
        can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api/v1beta4/instances/export#exportContext.databases

     --escape=ESCAPE
        Specifies the character that should appear before a data character that
        needs to be escaped. The value of this argument has to be a character
        in Hex ASCII Code. For example, "22" represents double quotes. This
        flag is only available for MySQL and Postgres. If this flag is not
        provided, double quotes character will be used as the default value.

     --fields-terminated-by=FIELDS_TERMINATED_BY
        Specifies the character that splits column values. The value of this
        argument has to be a character in Hex ASCII Code. For example, "2C"
        represents a comma. This flag is only available for MySQL and Postgres.
        If this flag is not provided, a comma character will be used as the
        default value.

     --lines-terminated-by=LINES_TERMINATED_BY
        Specifies the character that split line records. The value of this
        argument has to be a character in Hex ASCII Code. For example, "0A"
        represents a new line. This flag is only available for MySQL. If this
        flag is not provided, a new line character will be used as the default
        value.

     --offload
        Offload an export to a temporary instance. Doing so reduces strain on
        source instances and allows other operations to be performed while the
        export is in progress.

     --quote=QUOTE
        Specifies the character that encloses values from columns that have
        string data type. The value of this argument has to be a character in
        Hex ASCII Code. For example, "22" represents double quotes. This flag
        is only available for MySQL and Postgres. If this flag is not provided,
        double quotes character will be used as the default value.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud sql export csv

        $ gcloud beta sql export csv
