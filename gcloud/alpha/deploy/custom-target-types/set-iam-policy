POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Custom target type resource - The custom target type for which to set the
     IAM policy. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument custom_target_type on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CUSTOM_TARGET_TYPE
          ID of the custom target type or fully qualified identifier for the
          custom target type.

          To set the custom_target_type attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument custom_target_type on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          Location of the custom target type.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument custom_target_type on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property deploy/region.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
