NAME
    gcloud alpha deploy custom-target-types add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM
        policy binding for a Cloud Deploy Custom Target Type

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha deploy custom-target-types add-iam-policy-binding
        (CUSTOM_TARGET_TYPE : --region=REGION) --member=PRINCIPAL --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Adds a policy binding to the IAM policy of a Cloud Deploy Custom
    Target Type. One binding consists of a member and a role.

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of
    roles/clouddeploy.customTargetTypeAdmin for the user test-user@gmail.com on
    my-custom-target-type with the region us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha deploy custom-target-types add-iam-policy-binding \
            my-custom-target-type --region='us-central1' \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/clouddeploy.customTargetTypeAdmin'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Custom target type resource - The custom target type for which to add the
     IAM policy binding. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument custom_target_type on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CUSTOM_TARGET_TYPE
          ID of the custom target type or fully qualified identifier for the
          custom target type.

          To set the custom_target_type attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument custom_target_type on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          Location of the custom target type.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument custom_target_type on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property deploy/region.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Role name to assign to the principal. The role name is the complete
        path of a predefined role, such as roles/logging.viewer, or the role ID
        for a custom role, such as
        organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/logging.viewer.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          A condition to include in the binding. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a basic role. Basic roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer. For more on conditions, refer to the
          conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud deploy custom-target-types add-iam-policy-binding

        $ gcloud beta deploy custom-target-types add-iam-policy-binding
