DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster.

EXAMPLES
    To create a cluster, run the following:

        $ gcloud alpha managed-kafka clusters create mycluster \
            --location=us-central1 --cpu=3 --memory=3GiB \
            --subnets=projects/PROJECT_ID/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/\
        default

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - Identifies the cluster for which the command runs. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location of the Managed Service for Apache Kafka resource.
          See
          https://cloud.google.com/managed-service-for-apache-kafka/docs/locations
          for a list of supported locations.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --cpu=CPU
        The number of vCPUs to provision for the cluster. The minimum is 3.

     --memory=MEMORY
        The memory to provision for the cluster in bytes. The value must be
        between 1 GiB and 8 GiB per vCPU. Ex. 1024Mi, 4Gi.

     --subnets=[SUBNETS,...]
        A comma-separated list of VPC subnets from which the cluster is
        accessible. Both broker and bootstrap server IP addresses and DNS
        entries are automatically created in each subnet. Only one subnet per
        network is allowed, and the subnet must be located in the same region
        as the cluster. The project may differ. A minimum of 1 subnet is
        required. A maximum of 10 subnets can be specified. Use commas to
        separate multiple subnets. The name of the subnet must be in the format
        projects/PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNET.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --auto-rebalance
        Whether the automatic rebalancing is enabled. If automatic rebalancing
        is enabled, topic partitions are rebalanced among brokers when the
        number of CPUs in the cluster changes. Automatic rebalancing is enabled
        by default. Use --no-auto-rebalance to disable this flag. Enabled by
        default, use --no-auto-rebalance to disable.

     --broker-disk-size-gib=BROKER_DISK_SIZE_GIB
        The amount of local disk to provision for each broker in Gibibytes.
        Minimum: 100 GiB.

     --encryption-key=ENCRYPTION_KEY
        The relative resource path of the Cloud KMS key to use for encryption
        in the form:
        projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/keyRings/KEY_RING/cryptoKeys/KEY.
        The key must be located in the same region as the cluster. The key
        cannot be changed once set.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add. Keys must start with a lowercase
        character and contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase
        characters, and numbers. Values must contain only hyphens (-),
        underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers.

     --mtls-ca-pools=[MTLS_CA_POOLS,...]
        A comma-separated list of CA pools from the Google Cloud Certificate
        Authority Service. The root certificates of these CA pools will be
        installed in the truststore of each broker in the cluster for use with
        mTLS. A maximum of 10 CA pools can be specified. CA pools can be in a
        different project and region than the cluster. This command overwrites
        the entire set of pools currently configured on the cluster. If you
        want to add a new pool to an existing configuration, you must provide
        the full list of both the old and new CA pools in the command. Each CA
        pool must be in the format
        projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/caPools/CA_POOL. Clear the CA
        pools using the --clear-mtls-ca-pools flag.

     --ssl-principal-mapping-rules=SSL_PRINCIPAL_MAPPING_RULES
        The rules for mapping mTLS certificate Distinguished Names (DNs) to
        shortened principal names for Kafka ACLs. This flag corresponds exactly
        to the ssl.principal.mapping.rules broker config and matches the format
        and syntax defined in the Apache Kafka documentation. Setting or
        modifying this field will trigger a rolling restart of the Kafka
        brokers to apply the change. An empty string means that the default
        Kafka behavior is used. Example:
        "RULE:^CN=(.?),OU=ServiceUsers.$/$1@example.com/,DEFAULT"

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the managedkafka/v1 API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/managed-service-for-apache-kafka/docs

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud managed-kafka clusters create

        $ gcloud beta managed-kafka clusters create
