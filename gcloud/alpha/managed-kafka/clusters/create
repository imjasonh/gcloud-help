NAME
    gcloud alpha managed-kafka clusters create - create a Managed Service for
        Apache Kafka cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha managed-kafka clusters create (CLUSTER : --location=LOCATION)
        --cpu=CPU --memory=MEMORY --subnets=[SUBNETS,...] [--async]
        [--no-auto-rebalance] [--encryption-key=ENCRYPTION_KEY]
        [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster.

EXAMPLES
    To create a cluster, run the following:

        $ gcloud alpha managed-kafka clusters create mycluster \
            --location=us-central1 --cpu=3 --memory=3GiB \
            --subnets=projects/PROJECT_ID/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/\
        default

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - Identifies the cluster for which the command runs. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location of the Managed Service for Apache Kafka resource.
          See https://cloud.google.com/managed-kafka/docs/locations for a list
          of supported locations.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --cpu=CPU
        The number of vCPUs to provision for the cluster. The minimum is 3.

     --memory=MEMORY
        The memory to provision for the cluster in bytes. The value must be
        between 1 GiB and 8 GiB per vCPU. Ex. 1024Mi, 4Gi.

     --subnets=[SUBNETS,...]
        VPC subnets from which the cluster is accessible. Both broker and
        bootstrap server IP addresses and DNS entries are automatically created
        in each subnet. The subnet must be located in the same region as the
        cluster. The project may differ. A minimum of 1 subnet is required. A
        maximum of 10 subnets can be specified. Use commas to separate multiple
        subnets. The name of the subnet must be in the format
        projects/PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNET.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --auto-rebalance
        Whether the automatic rebalancing is enabled. If automatic rebalancing
        is enabled, topic partitions are rebalanced among brokers when the
        number of CPUs in the cluster changes. Automatic rebalancing is enabled
        by default. Use --no-auto-rebalance to disable this flag. Enabled by
        default, use --no-auto-rebalance to disable.

     --encryption-key=ENCRYPTION_KEY
        The relative resource path of the Cloud KMS key to use for encryption
        in the form:
        projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/keyRings/KEY_RING/cryptoKeys/KEY.
        The key must be located in the same region as the cluster. The key
        cannot be changed once set.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add. Keys must start with a lowercase
        character and contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase
        characters, and numbers. Values must contain only hyphens (-),
        underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the managedkafka/v1 API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/managed-kafka

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta managed-kafka clusters create
