NAME
    gcloud alpha managed-kafka clusters update - update a Managed Service for
        Apache Kafka cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha managed-kafka clusters update (CLUSTER : --location=LOCATION)
        (--auto-rebalance --cpu=CPU --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...] --memory=MEMORY
          --mtls-ca-pools=[MTLS_CA_POOLS,...]
          --ssl-principal-mapping-rules=SSL_PRINCIPAL_MAPPING_RULES
          --subnets=[SUBNETS,...]) [--async] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster.

EXAMPLES
    To update an attribute in a cluster named mycluster located in us-central1,
    such as the CPU, run the following:

        $ gcloud alpha managed-kafka clusters update mycluster \
            --location=us-central1 --cpu=3

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - Identifies the cluster to be updated. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location of the Managed Service for Apache Kafka resource.
          See
          https://cloud.google.com/managed-service-for-apache-kafka/docs/locations
          for a list of supported locations.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     At least one of these must be specified:

       --auto-rebalance
          Whether the automatic rebalancing is enabled. If automatic
          rebalancing is enabled, topic partitions are rebalanced among brokers
          when the number of CPUs in the cluster changes. Automatic rebalancing
          is enabled by default. Use --no-auto-rebalance to disable this flag.

       --cpu=CPU
          The number of vCPUs to provision for the cluster. The minimum is 3.

       --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add. Keys must start with a
          lowercase character and contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_),
          lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must contain only hyphens
          (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers.

       --memory=MEMORY
          The memory to provision for the cluster in bytes. The value must be
          between 1 GiB and 8 GiB per vCPU. Ex. 1024Mi, 4Gi.

       --mtls-ca-pools=[MTLS_CA_POOLS,...]
          A comma-separated list of CA pools from the Google Cloud Certificate
          Authority Service. The root certificates of these CA pools will be
          installed in the truststore of each broker in the cluster for use
          with mTLS. A maximum of 10 CA pools can be specified. CA pools can be
          in a different project and region than the cluster. Each CA pool must
          be in the format
          projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/caPools/CA_POOL.

       --ssl-principal-mapping-rules=SSL_PRINCIPAL_MAPPING_RULES
          The rules for mapping mTLS certificate Distinguished Names (DNs) to
          shortened principal names for Kafka ACLs. This flag corresponds
          exactly to the ssl.principal.mapping.rules broker config and matches
          the format and syntax defined in the Apache Kafka documentation.
          Setting or modifying this field will trigger a rolling restart of the
          Kafka brokers to apply the change. An empty string means that the
          default Kafka behavior is used. Example:
          "RULE:^CN=(.?),OU=ServiceUsers.$/$1@example.com/,DEFAULT"

       --subnets=[SUBNETS,...]
          A comma-separated list of VPC subnets from which the cluster is
          accessible. Both broker and bootstrap server IP addresses and DNS
          entries are automatically created in each subnet. Only one subnet per
          network is allowed, and the subnet must be located in the same region
          as the cluster. The project may differ. A minimum of 1 subnet is
          required. A maximum of 10 subnets can be specified. Use commas to
          separate multiple subnets. The name of the subnet must be in the
          format projects/PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNET.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the managedkafka/v1 API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/managed-service-for-apache-kafka/docs

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud managed-kafka clusters update

        $ gcloud beta managed-kafka clusters update
