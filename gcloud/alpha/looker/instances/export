NAME
    gcloud alpha looker instances export - export a Looker instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha looker instances export (INSTANCE : --region=REGION)
        --kms-key=KMS_KEY --target-gcs-uri=TARGET_GCS_URI
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The instance specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access the given
        instance.
      ▪ The Google Cloud Storage bucket does not exist.

EXAMPLES
    To export an instance with the name my-looker-instance in the default
    region, run:

        $ gcloud alpha looker instances export my-looker-instance \
            --target-gcs-uri='gs://bucketName/folderName' \
            --kms-key='projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/keyRings/my\
        -key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key'

    Note that the kms-key flag should be the full name of the kms key.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - Arguments and flags that specify the Looker instance
     you want to export. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance.

          To set the instance attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The region of the instance.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the Looker instance and backups. The 'Looker Service
     Agent' service account must hold role 'Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter'. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource.

     This must be specified.

       --kms-key=KMS_KEY
          Fully qualified identifier (name) for the key.

     Export Destination - The path and storage where the export will be stored.

     This must be specified.

       --target-gcs-uri=TARGET_GCS_URI
          The path to the folder in Google Cloud Storage where the export will
          be stored. The URI is in the form gs://bucketName/folderName. The
          Looker Service Agent should have the role Storage Object Creator.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud looker instances export
