DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an AI Platform version.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Version resource - The AI Platform model to update. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument version on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       VERSION
          ID of the version or fully qualified identifier for the version. To
          set the version attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument version on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --model=MODEL
          Model for the version. To set the model attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument version on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --model on the command line.

FLAGS
     --config=YAML_FILE
        Path to a YAML configuration file containing configuration parameters
        for the version
        (https://cloud.google.com/ml/reference/rest/v1/projects.models.versions)
        to create.

        The file is in YAML format. Note that not all attributes of a version
        are configurable; available attributes (with example values) are:

            description: A free-form description of the version.
            manualScaling:
              nodes: 10  # The number of nodes to allocate for this model.
            autoScaling:
              minNodes: 0  # The minimum number of nodes to allocate for this model.
              maxNodes: 1  # The maxinum number of nodes to allocate for this model.
            requestLoggingconfig:
              bigqueryTableName: someTable  # Fully qualified BigQuery table name.
              samplingPercentage: 0.5  # Percentage of requests to be logged.

        The name of the version must always be specified via the required
        VERSION argument.

        Only one of manualScaling or autoScaling can be specified. If both are
        specified in same yaml file, an error will be returned.

        Labels cannot currently be set in the config.yaml; please use the
        command-line flags to alter them.

        If an option is specified both in the configuration file and via
        command-line arguments, the command-line arguments override the
        configuration file.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the version.

     --region=REGION
        Google Cloud region of the regional endpoint to use for this command.
        For the global endpoint, the region needs to be specified as global.

        Learn more about regional endpoints and see a list of available
        regions:
        https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs/regional-endpoints

        REGION must be one of: global, asia-east1, asia-northeast1,
        asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-west1, europe-west2,
        europe-west3, europe-west4, northamerica-northeast1, us-central1,
        us-east1, us-east4, us-west1.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     Configure request response logging.

       --bigquery-table-name=BIGQUERY_TABLE_NAME
          Fully qualified name (project_id.dataset_name.table_name) of the
          BigQuery table where requests and responses are logged.

       --sampling-percentage=SAMPLING_PERCENTAGE
          Percentage of requests to be logged, expressed as a number between 0
          and 1. For example, set this value to 1 in order to log all requests
          or to 0.1 to log 10% of requests.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha ml-engine versions update --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud alpha ml-engine versions update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud ml-engine versions update

        $ gcloud beta ml-engine versions update
