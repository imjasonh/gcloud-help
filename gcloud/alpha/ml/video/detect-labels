NAME
    gcloud alpha ml video detect-labels - detect general labels for videos

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha ml video detect-labels INPUT_PATH [--async]
        [--detection-mode=DETECTION_MODE; default="shot"]
        [--output-uri=OUTPUT_URI] [--region=REGION] [--segments=[SEGMENTS,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Detect general categories in videos, such as modes of
    transportation or animals. Use the --detection-mode flag to control whether
    labels are detected for shots, frames, or both.

EXAMPLES
    To detect labels in video file 'gs://my_bucket/input_file.mp4':

        $ gcloud alpha ml video detect-labels gs://my_bucket/input_file.mp4

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INPUT_PATH
        Path to the video to be analyzed. Must be a local path or a Google
        Cloud Storage URI.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --detection-mode=DETECTION_MODE; default="shot"
        The mode of label detection requested. DETECTION_MODE must be one of:

         frame
            Detect labels at the per-frame level.
         shot
            Detect labels at the per-shot level.
         shot-and-frame
            Detect labels at both the per-shot and per-frame level.

     --output-uri=OUTPUT_URI
        Location to which the results should be written. Must be a Google Cloud
        Storage URI.

     --region=REGION
        Optional Cloud region where annotation should take place. If no region
        is specified, a region will be determined based on video file location.
        REGION must be one of: asia-east1, europe-west1, us-east1, us-west1.

     --segments=[SEGMENTS,...]
        Segments from the video which you want to analyze (by default, the
        entire video will be treated as one segment). Must be in the format
        START1:END1[,START2:END2,...] (inclusive). START and END of segments
        must be a properly formatted duration string of the form HhMmSs where:

            *  H is the number of hours from beginning of video
            *  M is the number of minutes from the beginning of video
            *  S is the number of seconds from the beginning of the video

        H, M and S can be specified as ints or floats for fractional units (to
        microsecond resolution). Unit chars (e.g. h, m or s) are required.
        Microseconds can be specified using fractional seconds e.g. 0.000569s
        == 569 microseconds.

        Examples:

        0s:23.554048s,24s:29.528064s

        0:1m40s,3m50s:5m10.232265s

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the videointelligence/v1 API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud ml video detect-labels

        $ gcloud beta ml video detect-labels
