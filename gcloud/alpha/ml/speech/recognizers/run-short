DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Get transcripts of short (less than 60 seconds) audio from an audio
    file.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Recognizer resource - recognizer. The arguments in this group can be used
     to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument recognizer on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       RECOGNIZER
          ID of the recognizer or fully qualified identifier for the
          recognizer.

          To set the recognizer attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument recognizer on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the recognizer.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument recognizer on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --audio=AUDIO
        Location of the audio file to transcribe. Must be a audio data bytes,
        local file, or Google Cloud Storage URL (in the format
        gs://bucket/object).

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --hints=[HINTS,...]
        A list of strings containing word and phrase "hints" so that the '
        'speech recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be '
        'used to improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, ' 'for
        example, if specific commands are typically spoken by ' 'the user. This
        can also be used to add additional words to the ' 'vocabulary of the
        recognizer. ' 'See https://cloud.google.com/speech/limits#content.

     --language-codes=[LANGUAGE_CODE,...]
        Language code is one of en-US, en-GB, fr-FR. Check documentation
        (https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/multiple-languages) for
        using more than one language code.

     --model=MODEL
        Which model to use for recognition requests. Select the model best
        suited to your domain to get best results. Guidance for choosing which
        model to use can be found in the Transcription Models Documentation
        (https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/v2/docs/transcription-model)
        and the models supported in each region can be found in the Table Of
        Supported Models
        (https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/v2/docs/speech-to-text-supported-languages).

     Encoding format

       --audio-channel-count=AUDIO_CHANNEL_COUNT
          Number of channels present in the audio data sent for recognition.
          Required if --encoding flag is specified and is not AUTO.

       --encoding=ENCODING
          Encoding format of the provided audio. For headerless formats, must
          be set to LINEAR16, MULAW, or ALAW. For other formats, set to AUTO.
          Overrides the recognizer configuration if present, else uses
          recognizer encoding.

       --sample-rate=SAMPLE_RATE
          Sample rate in Hertz of the audio data sent for recognition. Required
          if --encoding flag is specified and is not AUTO.

     ASR Features

       --[no-]enable-automatic-punctuation
          If true, adds punctuation to recognition result hypotheses. Use
          --enable-automatic-punctuation to enable and
          --no-enable-automatic-punctuation to disable.

       --[no-]enable-spoken-emojis
          If true, adds spoken emoji formatting. Use --enable-spoken-emojis to
          enable and --no-enable-spoken-emojis to disable.

       --[no-]enable-spoken-punctuation
          If true, replaces spoken punctuation with the corresponding symbols
          in the request. Use --enable-spoken-punctuation to enable and
          --no-enable-spoken-punctuation to disable.

       --[no-]enable-word-confidence
          If true, the top result includes a list of words and the confidence
          for those words. Use --enable-word-confidence to enable and
          --no-enable-word-confidence to disable.

       --[no-]enable-word-time-offsets
          If true, the top result includes a list of words and their
          timestamps. Use --enable-word-time-offsets to enable and
          --no-enable-word-time-offsets to disable.

       --max-alternatives=MAX_ALTERNATIVES
          Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned. Valid values
          are 1-30.

       --[no-]profanity-filter
          If true, the server will censor profanities. Use --profanity-filter
          to enable and --no-profanity-filter to disable.

       --[no-]separate-channel-recognition
          Mode for recognizing multi-channel audio using Separate Channel
          Recognition. When set to true, the service will recognize each
          channel independently. Use --separate-channel-recognition to enable
          and --no-separate-channel-recognition to disable.

       Speaker Diarization

         --max-speaker-count=MAX_SPEAKER_COUNT
            Maximum number of speakers in the conversation.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --min-speaker-count=MIN_SPEAKER_COUNT
            Minimum number of speakers in the conversation.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
