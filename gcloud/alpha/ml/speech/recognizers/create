DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a speech-to-text recognizer.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Recognizer resource - recognizer. The arguments in this group can be used
     to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument recognizer on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       RECOGNIZER
          ID of the recognizer or fully qualified identifier for the
          recognizer.

          To set the recognizer attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument recognizer on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the recognizer.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument recognizer on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --language-codes=[LANGUAGE_CODE,...]
        Language code is one of en-US, en-GB, fr-FR. Check documentation
        (https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/multiple-languages) for
        using more than one language code.

     --model=MODEL
        Which model to use for recognition requests. Select the model best
        suited to your domain to get best results. Guidance for choosing which
        model to use can be found in the Transcription Models Documentation
        (https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/v2/docs/transcription-model)
        and the models supported in each region can be found in the Table Of
        Supported Models
        (https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/v2/docs/speech-to-text-supported-languages).

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is False.

     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
        Name of this recognizer as it appears in UIs.

     Encoding format

     --audio-channel-count=AUDIO_CHANNEL_COUNT
        Number of channels present in the audio data sent for recognition.
        Required if --encoding flag is specified and is not AUTO. Must be set
        to a value between 1 and 8.

     --encoding=ENCODING
        Encoding format of the provided audio. For headerless formats, must be
        set to LINEAR16, MULAW, or ALAW. For other formats, set to AUTO.
        Overrides the recognizer configuration if present, else uses recognizer
        encoding.

     --sample-rate=SAMPLE_RATE
        Sample rate in Hertz of the audio data sent for recognition. Required
        if --encoding flag is specified and is not AUTO. Must be set to a value
        between 8000 and 48000.

     ASR Features

     --enable-automatic-punctuation
        If set, adds punctuation to recognition result hypotheses.

     --enable-spoken-emojis
        If set, adds spoken emoji formatting.

     --enable-spoken-punctuation
        If set, replaces spoken punctuation with the corresponding symbols in
        the request.

     --enable-word-confidence
        If set, the top result includes a list of words and the confidence for
        those words.

     --enable-word-time-offsets
        If set, the top result includes a list of words and their timestamps.

     --max-alternatives=MAX_ALTERNATIVES
        Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned. Must be set to
        a value between 1 and 30.

     --profanity-filter
        If set, the server will censor profanities.

     --separate-channel-recognition
        Mode for recognizing multi-channel audio using Separate Channel
        Recognition. When set, the service will recognize each channel
        independently.

     Speaker Diarization

     --max-speaker-count=MAX_SPEAKER_COUNT
        Maximum number of speakers in the conversation. Must be greater than or
        equal to --min-speaker-count. Must be set to a value between 1 and 6.

        This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
        this group are specified.

     --min-speaker-count=MIN_SPEAKER_COUNT
        Minimum number of speakers in the conversation. Must be less than or
        equal to --max-speaker-count. Must be set to a value between 1 and 6.

        This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
        this group are specified.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
