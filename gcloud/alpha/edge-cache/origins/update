        [--async] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--failover-origin=FAILOVER_ORIGIN] [--labels=KEY=VALUE]
        [--max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS] [--origin-address=ORIGIN_ADDRESS]
        [--port=PORT] [--protocol=PROTOCOL]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an existing EdgeCacheOrigin resource.

EXAMPLES
    To update an EdgeCacheOrigin resource named 'my-origin', run:

        $ gcloud alpha edge-cache origins update my-origin \
            --origin-address=new-origin.example.com

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Origin resource - The name of the EdgeCacheOrigin resource to create. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument origin on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       ORIGIN
          ID of the origin or fully qualified identifier for the origin. To set
          the origin attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument origin on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location Id.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument origin on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ use global location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable description of the resource.

     --failover-origin=FAILOVER_ORIGIN
        Origin resource to try when the current origin cannot be reached. After
        maxAttempts is reached, the configured failoverOrigin will be used to
        fulfil the request.

        For example, the following are both valid URLs to an EdgeCacheOrigin
        resource:

        ◆ /projects/PROJECT/locations/global/edgeCacheOrigins/yourOrigin
        ◆ yourOrigin

        The value of timeout.maxAttemptsTimeout dictates the timeout across all
        origins.

     --labels=KEY=VALUE
        List of KEY=VALUE labels to attach to this resource.

     --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS
        Maximum number of attempts to cache fill from this origin. Another
        attempt is made when a cache fill fails with one of the
        retry_conditions.

        Once max_attempts to this origin have failed the failover_origin will
        be used, if one is specified. That failover_origin may specify its own
        max_attempts, retry_conditions and failover_origin to control its own
        cache fill failures.

        The total number of allowed attempts to cache fill across this and
        failover origins is limited to four. The total time allowed for cache
        fill attempts across this and failover origins can be controlled with
        max_attempts_timeout.

        The last valid response from an origin will be returned to the client.
        If no origin returns a valid response, an HTTP 503 will be returned to
        the client.

        Defaults to 1. Must be a value greater than 0 and less than 4.

     --origin-address=ORIGIN_ADDRESS
        A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address reachable over the
        public Internet, or the address of a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

        This address will be used as the origin for cache requests - e.g.
        ◆ FQDN: media-backend.example.com
        ◆ IPv4: 35.218.1.1
        ◆ IPv6: [2607:f8b0:4012:809::200e]
        ◆ Cloud Storage: gs://bucketname

        When providing an FQDN (hostname), it must be publicly resolvable (e.g.
        via Google public DNS) and IP addresses must be publicly routable. If a
        Cloud Storage bucket is provided, it must be in the canonical
        "gs://bucketname" format. Other forms, such as
        "storage.googleapis.com", will be rejected.

     --port=PORT
        Port to connect to the origin on. Defaults to port 443 for HTTP2 and
        HTTPS protocols, and port 80 for HTTP.

     --protocol=PROTOCOL
        Protocol to use to connect to the configured origin. Defaults to HTTP2,
        and it is strongly recommended that users use HTTP2 for both security &
        performance.

        When using HTTP2 or HTTPS as the protocol, a valid, publicly-signed,
        unexpired TLS (SSL) certificate must be presented by the origin server.

        PROTOCOL must be one of:

         http
            HTTP without TLS (SSL). This is not recommended, as communication
            outside of Google's network will be unencrypted to the public
            endpoint (origin).

         http2
            HTTP/2 protocol. HTTP/2 refers to "h2", which requires TLS (HTTPS).
            Requires a valid (public, unexpired) TLS certificate to be present
            on the origin.

         https
            HTTP/1.1 with TLS (SSL). Requires a valid (public, unexpired) TLS
            certificate to be present on the origin.

     --response-timeout=RESPONSE_TIMEOUT
        Maximum duration to wait for data to arrive when reading from the HTTP
        connection/stream.

        Defaults to 5 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s.

     --retry-conditions=[RETRY_CONDITIONS,...]
        Specifies one or more retry conditions for the configured origin.

        If the failure mode during a connection attempt to the origin matches
        the configured retryCondition(s), the origin request will be retried up
        to maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if configured, will then be
        used to satisfy the request.

        The default retryCondition is "connect-failure".

        retryConditions apply to this origin, and not subsequent
        failoverOrigin(s), which may specify their own retryConditions and
        maxAttempts.

        Valid values are:

        ◆ connect-failure: Retry on failures connecting to origins, for
          example due to connection timeouts.
        ◆ http-5xx: Retry if the origin responds with any 5xx response code,
          or if the origin does not respond at all, example: disconnects,
          reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused streams.
        ◆ gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
          502, 503 or 504.
        ◆ retriable-4xx: Retry for retriable 4xx response codes, which
          include HTTP 409 (Conflict) and HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
        ◆ not-found: Retry if the origin returns a HTTP 404 (Not Found). This
          can be useful when generating video content, and the segment is not
          available yet.

        RETRY_CONDITIONS must be one of: connect-failure, forbidden,
        gateway-error, http-5xx, not-found, retriable-4xx,
        retry-conditions-unspecified.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the networkservices/v1alpha1 API. The full documentation
    for this API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/networking

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud edge-cache origins update
