NAME
    gcloud alpha apigee organizations provision - provision an Apigee SaaS
        organization

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha apigee organizations provision
        --authorized-network=AUTHORIZED_NETWORK
        [--analytics-region=ANALYTICS_REGION] [--async]
        [--runtime-location=RUNTIME_LOCATION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Provision an Apigee SaaS organization.

    gcloud alpha apigee organizations provision creates an Apigee organization
    and populates it with the necessary child resources to be immediately
    useable.

    This is a long running operation and could take anywhere from 10 minutes to
    1 hour to complete.

    At the moment, only trial organizations are supported.

EXAMPLES
    To provision an organization for the active Cloud Platform project,
    attached to a network named default run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee organizations provision \
          --authorized-network=default

    To provision an organization asynchronously and print only the name of the
    launched operation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee organizations provision \
          --authorized-network=default --async --format="value(name)"

    To provision an organization for the project named my-proj, with analytics
    and runtimes located in us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee organizations provision \
          --authorized-network=default --project=my-proj \
          --analytics-region=us-central1 --runtime-location=us-central1-a

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --authorized-network=AUTHORIZED_NETWORK
        Name of the network to which the provisioned organization should be
        attached. This must be a VPC network peered through Service Networking.
        To get a list of existing networks, run:

            $ gcloud compute networks list

        To check whether a network is peered through Service Networking, run:

            $ gcloud services vpc-peerings list --network=NETWORK_NAME \
              --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com

        To create a new network suitable for Apigee provisioning, choose a name
        for the network and address range, and run:

            $ gcloud compute networks create NETWORK_NAME \
              --bgp-routing-mode=global \
              --description='network for an Apigee trial'
            $ gcloud compute addresses create ADDRESS_RANGE_NAME --global \
              --prefix-length=16 \
              --description="peering range for an Apigee trial" \
              --network=NETWORK_NAME --purpose=vpc_peering
            $ gcloud services vpc-peerings connect \
              --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
              --network=NETWORK_NAME --ranges=ADDRESS_RANGE_NAME

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --analytics-region=ANALYTICS_REGION
        Primary Cloud Platform region for analytics data storage. For valid
        values, see: https://docs.apigee.com/hybrid/latest/precog-provision.

        If unspecified, the default is us-west1

     --async
        If set, returns immediately and outputs a description of the long
        running operation that was launched. Else, gcloud alpha apigee
        organizations provision will block until the organization has been
        provisioned.

        To monitor the operation once it's been launched, run gcloud alpha
        apigee operations describe OPERATION_NAME.

     --runtime-location=RUNTIME_LOCATION
        Cloud Platform location for the runtime instance. For trial
        organizations, this is a compute zone. To get a list of valid zones,
        run gcloud compute zones list. If unspecified, the default is
        us-west1-a.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
