NAME
    gcloud alpha apigee organizations - manage Apigee organizations

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha apigee organizations COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Manage Apigee organizations.

    gcloud alpha apigee organizations contains commands for managing Apigee
    organizations, the highest-level grouping of Apigee objects. All API
    proxies, environments, and so forth each belong to one organization.

    Apigee organizations are distinct from Cloud Platform organizations, being
    more similar to Cloud Platform projects in scope and purpose.

EXAMPLES
    To list all accessible organizations and their associated Cloud Platform
    projects, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee organizations list

    To get a JSON array of all organizations whose Cloud Platform project names
    contain the word sandbox, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee organizations list --format=json \
          --filter="project:(sandbox)"

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     delete
        (ALPHA) Delete an Apigee organization.

     list
        (ALPHA) List Apigee organizations and their paired Cloud Platform
        projects.

     provision

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud apigee organizations

        $ gcloud beta apigee organizations
