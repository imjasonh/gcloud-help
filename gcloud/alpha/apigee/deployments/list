SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha apigee deployments list
        [--api=API --environment=ENVIRONMENT
          --organization=ORGANIZATION --revision=REVISION]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List Apigee API proxy deployments.

    gcloud alpha apigee deployments list lists deployments of API proxies,
    optionally filtered by environment, proxy name, proxy revision, or a
    combination of these.

EXAMPLES
    To list all deployments for the active Cloud Platform project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee deployments list

    To list all deployments in an Apigee organization called my-org, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee deployments list --organization=my-org

    To list all deployments of an API proxy called my-proxy in the active Cloud
    Platform project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee deployments list --api=my-proxy

    To list all deployments to the test environment of the active Cloud
    Platform project, formatted as a JSON array, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee deployments list --environment=test \
          --format=json

    To list all deployments of my-proxy to the test environment in an Apigee
    organization called my-org, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee deployments list --organization=my-org \
          --api=my-proxy --environment=test

FLAGS
     Revision resource - API proxy revision and environment whose deployments
     should be listed. Providing a REVISION is only valid if API is also
     specified. If no REVISION is provided, all deployed revisions that match
     the other arguments will be included. The arguments in this group can be
     used to specify the attributes of this resource.

       --api=API
          The API proxy whose deployments should be listed. If not provided,
          all proxies will be listed. To get a list of existing API proxies,
          run gcloud alpha apigee apis list.

          To set the api attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --revision on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ leave the argument unspecified for it to be chosen automatically
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --api on the command line;
          ▸ leave the argument unspecified for it to be chosen automatically.

       --environment=ENVIRONMENT
          The environment whose deployments should be listed. If not provided,
          all environments will be listed. To get a list of available
          environments, run gcloud alpha apigee environments list.

          To set the environment attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --revision on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ leave the argument unspecified for it to be chosen automatically
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --environment on the command line;
          ▸ leave the argument unspecified for it to be chosen automatically.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization whose deployments should be listed.If unspecified,
          the Cloud Platform project's associated organization will be used.

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --revision on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ leave the argument unspecified for it to be chosen automatically
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --organization on the command line;
          ▸ set the property [project] or provide the argument [--project] on
            the command line, using a Cloud Platform project with an associated
            Apigee organization.

       --revision=REVISION
          ID of the revision or fully qualified identifier for the revision.

          To set the revision attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --revision on the command line;
          ▸ leave the argument unspecified for it to be chosen automatically.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud apigee deployments list

        $ gcloud beta apigee deployments list
