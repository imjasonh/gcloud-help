NAME
    gcloud alpha apigee archives deploy - deploy an Apigee archive deployment
        to an environment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha apigee archives deploy
        (--environment=ENVIRONMENT : --organization=ORGANIZATION) [--async]
        [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--bundle-file=BUNDLE_FILE | --source=SOURCE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deploy an Apigee archive deployment to an environment.

    gcloud alpha apigee archives deploy installs an archive deployment in an
    Apigee environment.

    By default, the archive deployment will be deployed on the remote
    management plane for the specified Apigee organization. To deploy on a
    locally running Apigee emulator, use the --local flag.

EXAMPLES
    To deploy the contents of the current working directory as an archive
    deployment to an environment named my-test, given that the Cloud Platform
    project has been set in gcloud settings, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee archives deploy --environment=my-test

    To deploy an archive deployment from a local directory other than the
    current working directory, to an environment named my-demo in an
    organization belonging to a Cloud Platform project other than the one set
    in gcloud settings, named my-org, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee archives deploy --organization=my-org \
            --environment=my-demo --source=/apigee/dev

    To deploy the contents of the current working directory as an archive
    deployment, with the user-defined labels my-label1=foo and my-label2=bar,
    to an environment named my-test, given that the Cloud Platform project has
    been set in gcloud settings, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee archives deploy --environment=my-test \
            --labels=my-label1=foo,my-label2=bar

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Environment resource - Apigee environment in which to deploy the archive
     deployment. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource.

     This must be specified.

       --environment=ENVIRONMENT
          ID of the environment or fully qualified identifier for the
          environment.

          To set the environment attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --environment on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Apigee organization containing the environment. If unspecified, the
          Cloud Platform project's associated organization will be used.

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --environment on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --organization on the command line;
          ▸ set the property [project] or provide the argument [--project] on
            the command line, using a Cloud Platform project with an associated
            Apigee organization.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        If set, returns immediately and outputs a description of the long
        running operation that was launched. Else, gcloud alpha apigee archives
        deploy will block until the archive deployment has been successfully
        deployed to the specified environment.

        To monitor the operation once it's been launched, run gcloud alpha
        apigee operations describe OPERATION_NAME.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     Source input.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --bundle-file=BUNDLE_FILE
          The zip file containing an archive to upload.

       --source=SOURCE
          The source directory of the archive to upload.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta apigee archives deploy
