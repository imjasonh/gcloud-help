NAME
    gcloud alpha artifacts vpcsc-config describe - describe the current
        Artifact Registry configuration for VPC Service Controls

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha artifacts vpcsc-config describe [--location=LOCATION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Describe the current Artifact Registry configuration for VPC
    Service Controls.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ Lack of permission - "accesscontextmanager.policies.get".
      ▪ The resource could be outside of the VPC SC perimeter.
      ▪ Lack of permission - "artifactregistry.vpcscconfigs.get"

EXAMPLES
    The following command returns the current VPC Service Controls
    configuration for the project my-project and region us-west1:

        $ gcloud alpha artifacts vpcsc-config describe \
           --project=my-project --location=us-west1

     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
        specified name;

      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.
