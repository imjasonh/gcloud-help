NAME
    gcloud alpha spanner instance-configs delete - delete a Cloud Spanner
        instance configuration

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha spanner instance-configs delete INSTANCE_CONFIG [--etag=ETAG]
        [--validate-only] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a Cloud Spanner instance configuration.

EXAMPLES

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_CONFIG
        Cloud Spanner instance config.

FLAGS
     --etag=ETAG
        Used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent
        simultaneous deletes of an instance config from overwriting each other.

     --validate-only
        Use this flag to validate that the request will succeed before
        executing it.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud spanner instance-configs delete

        $ gcloud beta spanner instance-configs delete
