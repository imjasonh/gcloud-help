SYNOPSIS

        POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Set the IAM policy for a Cloud Spanner backup given a backup ID and
    a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy.

EXAMPLES
    The following command reads an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    policy.json and sets it for a spanner instance with the ID
    example-instance:

        $ gcloud alpha spanner backups set-iam-policy example-backup \
            --instance=example-instance policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup resource - The Cloud Spanner backup to set the IAM policy for. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument backup on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP
          ID of the backup or fully qualified identifier for the backup.

          To set the backup attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --instance=INSTANCE
          The name of the Cloud Spanner instance.

          To set the instance attribute:

            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --instance on the command line;
          ▸ set the property spanner/instance.

     POLICY_FILE

        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
