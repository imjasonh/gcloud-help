NAME
    gcloud alpha lustre instances delete - deletes a Managed Lustre instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha lustre instances delete (INSTANCE : --location=LOCATION)
        [--async] [--request-id=REQUEST_ID] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) deletes a Managed Lustre instance.

EXAMPLES
    to delete an instance my-instance run:

        $ gcloud alpha lustre instances delete my-instance

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - The resource name of the instance to delete, in the
     format projects/{projectId}/locations/{location}/instances/{instanceId}.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance.

          To set the instance attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the instance resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --request-id=REQUEST_ID
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request
        ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
        ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
        guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
        the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
        request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
        request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.
        This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID
        is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the lustre/v1alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/managed-lustre/docs

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud lustre instances delete
