SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha bms networks update (NETWORK : --region=REGION) [--async]
        [--update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--add-ip-range-reservation=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
          | --clear-ip-range-reservations

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a Bare Metal Solution network.

    This call returns immediately, but the update operation may take several
    minutes to complete. To check if the operation is complete, use the
    describe command for the network.

EXAMPLES
    To update an network called my-network in region us-central1 with a new
    label key1=value1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha bms networks update my-network --region=us-central1 \
            --update-labels=key1=value1

    To clear all labels, run:

        $ gcloud alpha bms networks update my-network --region=us-central1 \
            --clear-labels

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Network resource - network. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument network on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       NETWORK
          ID of the network or fully qualified identifier for the network. To
          set the network attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument network on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the resource. To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument network on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --add-ip-range-reservation=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
          Add a reservation of a range of IP addresses in the network.

           start_address
              The first address of this reservation block. Must be specified as
              a single IPv4 address, e.g. 10.1.2.2.

           end_address
              The last address of this reservation block, inclusive. I.e., for
              cases when reservations are only single addresses, end_address
              and start_address will be the same. Must be specified as a single
              IPv4 address, e.g. 10.1.2.2.

           note
              A note about this reservation, intended for human consumption.

       --clear-ip-range-reservations
          Removes all IP range reservations in the network.

       --remove-ip-range-reservation=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
          Remove a reservation of a range of IP addresses in the network.

           start_address
              The first address of the reservation block to remove.

           end_address
              The last address of the reservation block to remove.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha bms networks update --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud alpha bms networks update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud bms networks update
