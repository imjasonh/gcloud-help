NAME
    gcloud alpha redis clusters create-backup - create a backup of a Redis
        cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha redis clusters create-backup (CLUSTER : --region=REGION)
        [--async] [--backup-id=BACKUP_ID] [--ttl=TTL] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a backup of a Redis cluster. The backup can be used to seed
    a new cluster or exported to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

    The created backup will be added into the backup collection associated with
    the cluster. Describe the cluster to get the backup collection name.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - Arguments and flags that specify the Memorystore Redis
     cluster to create a backup for. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Redis region of the cluster. Overrides the default
          redis/region property value for this command invocation.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property redis/region.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --backup-id=BACKUP_ID
        The ID of the backup.

     --ttl=TTL
        The time to live for the backup. The backup will be deleted
        automatically after the TTL is reached. For example, "10d" for 10 days.
        The minimum value is 1 day. If not specified, the default value is 100
        years.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the redis/v1alpha1 API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud redis clusters create-backup

        $ gcloud beta redis clusters create-backup
