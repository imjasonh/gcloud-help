SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

    cloud applications running on Google Cloud Platform. Cloud IAP works by
    verifying user identity and context of the request to determine if a user
    should be allowed to access the application.

    More information on Cloud IAP can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/iap and detailed documentation can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/
