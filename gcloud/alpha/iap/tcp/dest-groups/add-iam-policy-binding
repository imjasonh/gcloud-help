NAME
    gcloud alpha iap tcp dest-groups add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM policy
        binding to an IAP TCP Tunnel Destination Group resource

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iap tcp dest-groups add-iam-policy-binding
        --group-name=GROUP_NAME --member=PRINCIPAL --region=REGION --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Adds a policy binding to the IAM policy of an IAP TCP Tunnel
    Destination Group resource. One binding consists of a member, a role, and
    an optional condition.

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of
    'roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor' for the user 'test-user@gmail.com' in
    the group 'my-group' located in the region 'us-west1', run:

        $ gcloud alpha iap tcp dest-groups add-iam-policy-binding \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor' \
            --group-name='my-group' --region='us-west1'

    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of
    'roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor' for all authenticated users in the group
    'my-group' located in the region 'us-west1', run:

        $ gcloud alpha iap tcp dest-groups add-iam-policy-binding \
            --member='allAuthenticatedUsers' \
            --role='roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor' \
            --group-name='my-group' --region='us-west1'

    To add an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018 for
    the role of 'roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor' and the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' in the group 'my-group' located in the region
    'us-west1', run:

        $ gcloud alpha iap tcp dest-groups add-iam-policy-binding \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
            timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,
            description=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31' --group-name='my-group' --region='us-west1'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --group-name=GROUP_NAME
        Name of the Destination Group.

     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the Destination Group.

     --role=ROLE
        Role name to assign to the principal. The role name is the complete
        path of a predefined role, such as roles/logging.viewer, or the role ID
        for a custom role, such as
        organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/logging.viewer.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          A condition to include in the binding. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a basic role. Basic roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer. For more on conditions, refer to the
          conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta iap tcp dest-groups add-iam-policy-binding
