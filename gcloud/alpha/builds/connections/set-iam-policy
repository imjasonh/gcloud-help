SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha builds connections set-iam-policy
        (CONNECTION : --region=REGION) POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Set the IAM policy for a Cloud Build connection as defined in a
    JSON or YAML file.

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for the Connection named 'my-conn':

        $ gcloud alpha builds connections set-iam-policy my-conn \
            policy.json --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Connection resource - Cloud Build Connection for which to set IAM policy.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument connection on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       CONNECTION
          ID of the connection or fully qualified identifier for the
          connection.

          To set the connection attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument connection on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Google Cloud region.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument connection on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property builds/region.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
