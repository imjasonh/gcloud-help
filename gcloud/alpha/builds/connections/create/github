NAME
    gcloud alpha builds connections create github - create a Cloud Build
        Connection of type GitHub

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha builds connections create github
        (CONNECTION : --region=REGION) [--async]
        [--authorizer-token-secret-version=AUTHORIZER_TOKEN_SECRET_VERSION
          : --app-installation-id=APP_INSTALLATION_ID] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a Cloud Build Connection of type GitHub (for github.com).

    Connections for github.com can be created either by following an
    installation process (that requires manual steps in a web browser) or by
    providing the properties of an already-installed application (installation
    ID and a user token) as arguments to this command.

EXAMPLES
    To create a connection by following the installation process, provide only
    the connection name:

        $ gcloud alpha builds connections create github myconn \
            --project=myproj --region=us-central1

    The command will print a URL to be opened in a web browser in order to
    authorize Cloud Build (i.e. Cloud Build gets an OAuth token for the github
    account that you use). After doing this authorization, you can get the
    connection's installation state with the describe command:

        $ gcloud alpha builds connections describe myconn

    The output will include a second link to install the Cloud Build GitHub
    App. After doing this, the connection will be in installation state
    COMPLETE and repositories can be added to it (see gcloud alpha builds
    repositories create).

    --

    To create a complete connection (e.g. based on an existing user token and
    installation), provide both the authorizer secret token and the app
    installation id:

        $ gcloud alpha builds connections create github myconn \
            --project=myproj --region=us-central1 \
            --authorizer-token-secret-version=projects/myproj/secrets/\
        mytoken/versions/1 --app-installation-id=1234

    Above command creates the connection in installation state COMPLETE, ready
    for adding repositories.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Connection resource - Connection to create. The arguments in this group
     can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other

      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       CONNECTION

          ▸ set the property builds/region.

FLAGS
     --async

       --authorizer-token-secret-version=AUTHORIZER_TOKEN_SECRET_VERSION
          Secret containing the authorizer user's token.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --app-installation-id=APP_INSTALLATION_ID
          Installation ID of the Cloud Build GitHub App.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the cloudbuild/v2 API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud builds connections create github

        $ gcloud beta builds connections create github
