NAME
    gcloud alpha builds log - stream the logs for a build

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha builds log BUILD [--region=REGION] [--stream]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Stream the logs for a build.

EXAMPLES
    To stream logs for in progress build 123-456-789:

        $ gcloud alpha builds log --stream `123-456-789`

    To display logs for a completed build 098-765-432:

        $ gcloud alpha builds log `098-765-432`

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BUILD
        The build whose logs shall be printed. The ID of the build is printed
        at the end of the build submission process, or in the ID column when
        listing builds.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        The region of the Cloud Build Service to use. Must be set to a
        supported region name (e.g. us-central1). If unset, builds/region,
        which is the default region to use when working with Cloud Build
        resources, is used. If builds/region is unset, region is set to global.
        Note: Region must be specified in 2nd gen repo; global is not
        supported.

     --stream
        If a build is ongoing, stream the logs to stdout until the build
        completes.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud builds log

        $ gcloud beta builds log
