DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a private or hybrid pool used by Google Cloud Build.

EXAMPLES
      ▪ Private pools

    To change the machine type and disk size of a private pool named pwp1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha builds worker-pools update pwp1 \
            --region=us-central1 --worker-machine-type=e2-standard-2 \
            --worker-disk-size=64GB

      ▪ Hybrid pools

    To change the default build disk size and default build vcpu count of a
    hybrid pool named hwp1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha builds worker-pools update hwp1 --region=us-west4 \
            --default-build-disk-size=100GB --default-build-vcpu-count=3.5

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     WORKER_POOL
        Unique identifier for the worker pool to update. This value should be
        1-63 characters, and valid characters are [a-z][0-9]-

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud region where the worker pool is updated. See
        https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/locations for available locations.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE
          File that contains updates to the configuration for worker pool to be
          created.

          Private pool options:

              https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/worker-pool-config-file-schema

          Hybrid pool options:

              https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/hybrid/hybrid-pool-config-file-schema

       At most one of these can be specified:

         Command-line flags to configure the private pool:

           At most one of these can be specified:

             --public-egress
                If set, workers in the worker pool are created with an external
                IP address.

             --no-public-egress
                If set, workers in the worker pool are created without an
                external IP address.

                If the worker pool is within a VPC Service Control perimeter,
                use this flag.

           Configuration to be used for creating workers in the worker pool:

             --worker-disk-size=WORKER_DISK_SIZE
                Size of the disk attached to the worker.

                If not given, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.

             --worker-machine-type=WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE
                Compute Engine machine type for a worker pool.

                If unspecified, Cloud Build uses a standard machine type.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud builds worker-pools update

        $ gcloud beta builds worker-pools update
