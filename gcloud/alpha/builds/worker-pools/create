DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a private pool for use by Cloud Build.

EXAMPLES
      â–ª Private pools

    To create a private pool named pwp1 in region us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha builds worker-pools create pwp1 --region=us-central1

    To create a private pool in project p1 in region us-central1 where workers
    are of machine type e2-standard-2 and are peered to the VPC network
    projects/123/global/networks/default within the IP range 192.168.0.0/28 and
    have a disk size of 64GB, run:

        $ gcloud alpha builds worker-pools create pwp1 --project=p1 \
            --region=us-central1 \
            --peered-network=projects/123/global/networks/default \
            --peered-network-ip-range=192.168.0.0/28 \
            --worker-machine-type=e2-standard-2 --worker-disk-size=64GB

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     WORKER_POOL
        Unique identifier for the worker pool to create. This value should be
        1-63 characters, and valid characters are [a-z][0-9]-

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud region where the worker pool is created. See
        https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/locations for available locations.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --generation=GENERATION; default=1
        Generation of the worker pool.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE
          File that contains the configuration for the worker pool to be
          created.

          Private pool options:

              https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/worker-pool-config-file-schema

       Command-line flags to configure the private pool:

         At most one of these can be specified:

           Network configuration for Private Service Connect interface:

             --disable-public-ip-address
                If set, workers in the worker pool are created without an
                external IP address.

                If the worker pool is within a VPC Service Control perimeter,
                use this flag.

             --network-attachment=NETWORK_ATTACHMENT
                The network attachment that the worker network interface is
                peered to. The network attachment is specified in resource URL
                format
                projects/{project}/regions/{region}/networkAttachments/{name}.
                The region of network attachment must be the same as the worker
                pool. See
                https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/about-network-attachments for
                details.

             --route-all-traffic
                Route all traffic through PSC interface. Enable this if you
                want full control of traffic in the private pool. Configure
                Cloud NAT for the subnet of network attachment if you need to
                access public Internet.

                If unset, Only route private IPs, e.g. 10.0.0.0/8,
                172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16 through PSC interface.

           Network configuration for Service Networking:

             --peered-network=PEERED_NETWORK
                Existing network to which workers are peered. The network is
                specified in resource URL format
                projects/{network_project}/global/networks/{network_name}.

                If not specified, the workers are not peered to any network.

             --peered-network-ip-range=PEERED_NETWORK_IP_RANGE
                An IP range for your peered network. Specify the IP range using
                Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation with a slash and
                the subnet prefix size, such as /29.

                Your subnet prefix size must be between 1 and 29. Optional: you
                can specify an IP address before the subnet prefix value - for
                example 192.168.0.0/24.

                If no IP address is specified, your VPC automatically
                determines the starting IP for the range. If no IP range is
                specified, Cloud Build uses /24 as the default network IP
                range.

             --no-public-egress
                If set, workers in the worker pool are created without an
                external IP address.

                If the worker pool is within a VPC Service Control perimeter,
                use this flag.

         Configuration to be used for creating workers in the worker pool:

           --worker-disk-size=WORKER_DISK_SIZE
              Size of the disk attached to the worker.

              If not given, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.

           --worker-machine-type=WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE
              Compute Engine machine type for a worker pool.

              If unspecified, Cloud Build uses a standard machine type.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud builds worker-pools create

        $ gcloud beta builds worker-pools create
