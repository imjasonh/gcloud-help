POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Taxonomy resource - Policy tag taxonomy for which to add an IAM policy
     binding. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument taxonomy on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       TAXONOMY
          ID of the taxonomy or fully qualified identifier for the taxonomy.

          To set the taxonomy attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument taxonomy on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the taxonomy.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument taxonomy on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.

          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Role name to assign to the principal. The role name is the complete
        path of a predefined role, such as roles/logging.viewer, or the role ID
        for a custom role, such as
        organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/logging.viewer.
