NAME
    gcloud alpha firebase test android list-device-capacities - list capacity
        information for all supported Android models & versions

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha firebase test android list-device-capacities
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List device capacity (high/medium/low/none) for all Android models
    & versions.

    Device capacity is static information solely based on the number of devices
    in Firebase Test Lab. It's important to note that device capacity does not
    directly reflect any real-time data, like the length of the test queue,
    traffic, or the available/busy/broken state of the devices.

EXAMPLES
    To list capacity information for all devices which are available for
    testing, run:

        $ gcloud alpha firebase test android list-device-capacities

    To list only models made by Samsung, run:

        $ gcloud alpha firebase test android list-device-capacities \
            --filter=Samsung

    To list only physical device models, run:

        $ gcloud alpha firebase test android list-device-capacities \
            --filter=physical

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
