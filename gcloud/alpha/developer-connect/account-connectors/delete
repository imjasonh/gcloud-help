DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete an accountConnector

EXAMPLES
    To delete the accountConnector, run:

        $ gcloud alpha developer-connect account-connectors delete

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     AccountConnector resource - Name of the resource The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument account_connector on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       ACCOUNT_CONNECTOR
          ID of the accountConnector or fully qualified identifier for the
          accountConnector.

          To set the account_connector attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument account_connector on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the accountConnector resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument account_connector on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --etag=ETAG
        The current etag of the AccountConnectorn. If an etag is provided and
        does not match the current etag of the AccountConnector, deletion will
        be blocked and an ABORTED error will be returned.

     --force
        If set to true, any Users from this AccountConnector will also be
        deleted. (Otherwise, the request will only work if the AccountConnector
        has no Users.)

     --request-id=REQUEST_ID
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request
        ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
        ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
        guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
        the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
        request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
        request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.
        This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID
        is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

     --validate-only
        If set, validate the request, but do not actually post it.
