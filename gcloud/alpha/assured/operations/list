NAME
    gcloud alpha assured operations list - list all Assured Workloads
        operations that belong to a given parent organization

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha assured operations list --location=LOCATION
        --organization=ORGANIZATION [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List all Assured Workloads operations that belong to a given parent
    organization.

EXAMPLES
    The following example command lists all Assured Workloads operations with
    these properties:

      ▪ belonging to an organization with ID 123
      ▪ located in the us-central1 region
      ▪ return no more than 30 results
      ▪ requesting 10 results at a time from the backend

        $ gcloud alpha assured operations list \
            organizations/123/locations/us-central1 --limit=30 \
            --page-size=10

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        The location of the Assured Workloads operations. For a current list of
        supported LOCATION values, see Assured Workloads locations
        (https://cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/docs/locations).

     --organization=ORGANIZATION
        The parent organization of the Assured Workloads operations, provided
        as an organization ID.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud assured operations list

        $ gcloud beta assured operations list
