DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha logging copy copy log entries. Start a copy log
    entries operation.

EXAMPLES
    To start a copy log entries operation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging copy \
            "BUCKET_ID DESTINATION --location=LOCATION"

    To copy log entries in a specific time window, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging copy \
            'BUCKET_ID DESTINATION --location=LOCATION
         --log-filter=timestamp<="2021-05-31T23:59:59Z" AND
         timestamp>="2021-05-31T00:00:00Z"'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BUCKET_ID
        Id of the bucket to copy.

     DESTINATION
        destination to which to copy logs.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the bucket.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --log-filter=LOG_FILTER
        A filter specifying which log entries to copy. The filter must be no
        more than 20k characters. An empty filter matches all log entries.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Copy log entries associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Copy log entries associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Copy log entries associated with this organization.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Copy log entries associated with this project.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
