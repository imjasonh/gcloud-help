NAME
    gcloud alpha logging sinks delete - deletes a sink

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha logging sinks delete SINK_NAME
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deletes a sink and halts the export of log entries associated with
    that sink. Deleting a sink does not affect log entries already exported
    through the deleted sink, and will not affect other sinks that are
    exporting the same log(s).

EXAMPLES
    To delete a sync 'my-bq-sync':

        $ gcloud alpha logging sinks delete my-bq-sink

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name of the sink to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Delete a sink associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Delete a sink associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Delete a sink associated with this organization.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Delete a sink associated with this project.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud logging sinks delete

        $ gcloud beta logging sinks delete
