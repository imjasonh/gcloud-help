NAME
    gcloud alpha logging buckets delete - delete a bucket

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha logging buckets delete BUCKET_ID --location=LOCATION
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

EXAMPLES
    To delete bucket 'my-bucket' in location 'global', run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging buckets delete my-bucket --location=global

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BUCKET_ID
        ID of the bucket to delete.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the bucket.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Billing account of the bucket to delete.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the bucket to delete.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the bucket to delete.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the bucket to delete.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud logging buckets delete

        $ gcloud beta logging buckets delete
