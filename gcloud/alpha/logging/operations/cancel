NAME
    gcloud alpha logging operations cancel - cancel a long running operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha logging operations cancel OPERATION_ID --location=LOCATION
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Cancel a long running operation with given OPERATION_ID in given
    LOCATION. This operation can be a copy_log_entries operation which is
    scheduled before.

EXAMPLES
    To cancel an operation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging operations cancel OPERATION_ID \
            --location=LOCATION

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION_ID
        The Id of the operation.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the operation.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Cancel operation associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Cancel operation associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Cancel operation associated with this organization.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Cancel operation associated with this project.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud logging operations cancel

        $ gcloud beta logging operations cancel
