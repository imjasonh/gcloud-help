NAME
    gcloud alpha logging tail - tail log entries

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha logging tail [LOG_FILTER] [--buffer-window=BUFFER_WINDOW]
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [--bucket=BUCKET --location=LOCATION --view=VIEW]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha logging tail streams newly received log entries. Log
    entries matching log-filter are returned in the order that Cloud Logging
    received them. If the log entries come from multiple logs, then entries
    from different logs might be mixed in the results. To help return log
    entries in order, use --buffer-window.

    Before you can use gcloud alpha logging tail, you must complete the
    installation instructions at Live tailing log entries
    (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/tools/gcloud-logging#live-tailing).

    For the quotas and limits associated with gcloud alpha logging tail, see
    Logging API quotas and limits
    (https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas#api-limits).

EXAMPLES
    To stream log entries from Google Compute Engine instances, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail "resource.type=gce_instance"

    To stream log entries with severity ERROR or higher, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail "severity>=ERROR"

    To stream log entries with severity ERROR but only output the timestamps
    and instance IDs, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail "severity>=ERROR" \
            --format="default(timestamp,resource["labels"]["instance_id"])"

    To stream with minimal latency but potentially incorrect ordering:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail "resource.type=gce_instance" \
            --buffer-window=0s

    To stream log entries in your project's syslog log from Compute Engine
    instances containing payloads that include the word SyncAddress and format
    the output in JSON format, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail \
            "resource.type=gce_instance AND log_id(syslog) AND \
        textPayload:SyncAddress" --format=json

    To stream log entries from a folder, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail "resource.type=global" \
            --folder=[FOLDER_ID]

    Detailed information about filters can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [LOG_FILTER]
        Filter expression that specifies the log entries to return. A detailed
        guide on the Logging query language can be found at:
        https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language.

FLAGS
     --buffer-window=BUFFER_WINDOW
        The duration of time for which entries should be buffered for ordering
        before being returned. A longer buffer window helps to return logs in
        chronological order, but it also increases the latency from when
        entries are received by Cloud Logging to when they are returned. If
        unset, Cloud Logging will use 2s by default.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Billing account of the log entries to tail.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the log entries to tail.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the log entries to tail.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the log entries to tail.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

     These arguments are used in conjunction with the parent to construct a
     view resource.

       --bucket=BUCKET
          Id of the bucket. If this argument is provided, then --location and
          --view must also be specified.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the bucket. If this argument is provided, then --bucket
          and --view must also be specified.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --view=VIEW
          Id of the view. If this argument is provided, then --location and
          --bucket must also be specified.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta logging tail
