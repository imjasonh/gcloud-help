NAME
    gcloud alpha logging metrics update - updates the definition of a
        logs-based metric

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha logging metrics update METRIC_NAME
        (--config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE
          | --description=DESCRIPTION --log-filter=LOG_FILTER)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Updates the description or the filter expression of an existing
    logs-based metric.

EXAMPLES
    To update the description of a metric called high_severity_count, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging metrics update high_severity_count \
            --description="Count of high-severity log entries."

    To update the filter expression of the metric, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging metrics update high_severity_count \
            --log-filter="severity >= WARNING"

    Detailed information about filters can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language

    For advanced features such as user-defined labels and distribution metrics,
    update using a config file:

        $ gcloud alpha logging metrics update high_severity_count \
            --config-from-file=$PATH_TO_FILE

    The config file should be in YAML format. Detailed information about how to
    configure metrics can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/projects.metrics#LogMetric.
    Any top-level fields in the LogMetric definition that aren't specified in
    the config file will not be updated in the metric.

       Arguments to specify information about simple counter logs-based
       metrics.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud logging metrics update

        $ gcloud beta logging metrics update
