NAME
    gcloud alpha logging logs delete - deletes all entries from a log

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha logging logs delete LOG_NAME [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deletes all entries from a log. With no entries, the log will not
    appear in the list of your project's logs. However, you can write new
    entries to the log.

EXAMPLES
    To delete all entries from log 'my-log':

        $ gcloud alpha logging logs delete my-log

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     LOG_NAME
        Log name.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud logging logs delete

        $ gcloud beta logging logs delete
