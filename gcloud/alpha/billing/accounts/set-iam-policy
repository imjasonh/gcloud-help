NAME
    gcloud alpha billing accounts set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for a
        Cloud Billing account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha billing accounts set-iam-policy ACCOUNT POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha billing accounts set-iam-policy sets the IAM policy
    for a Cloud Billing account given an account ID and a JSON or YAML file
    that describes the IAM policy.

    Note: Setting the IAM policy for a Cloud Billing account replaces existing
    IAM bindings for that account.

EXAMPLES
    The following command reads an IAM policy defined in the JSON file
    policy.json and sets it for a Billing account ID 123456-789876-543210:

        $ gcloud alpha billing accounts set-iam-policy \
            123456-789876-543210 policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for policy file
    format and content details.

     policy. This represents a Cloud resource.
