NAME
    gcloud alpha billing projects link - link a project with a billing account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha billing projects link PROJECT_ID
        (--account-id=ACCOUNT_ID | --billing-account=ACCOUNT_ID)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command sets or updates the billing account associated with a
    project.

    Billing is enabled on a project when the project is linked to a valid,
    active Cloud Billing account. The billing account accrues charges for the
    usage of resources in all of the linked projects. If the project is already
    linked to a billing account, this command moves the project to the billing
    account you specify, updating the billing account that is linked to the
    project.

    Note that associating a project with a closed billing account has the same
    effect as disabling billing on the project: any paid resources in use by
    the project are shut down, and your application stops functioning. Unless
    you want to disable billing, you should always specify a valid, active
    Cloud Billing account when you run this command. Learn how to confirm the
    status of a Cloud Billing account at
    https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#billing_account_status

EXAMPLES
    To link a billing account 0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X with a project my-project,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha billing projects link my-project \
            --billing-account=0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PROJECT_ID
        Specify a project id.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --account-id=ACCOUNT_ID
          (DEPRECATED) Specify a billing account ID. Billing account IDs are of
          the form 0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X. To see available IDs, run $ gcloud
          alpha billing accounts list.

          The --account-id flag has been renamed --billing-account.

       --billing-account=ACCOUNT_ID
          Specify a billing account ID. Billing account IDs are of the form
          0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X. To see available IDs, run $ gcloud alpha
          billing accounts list.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the cloudbilling/v1 API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/billing/v1/getting-started

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta billing projects link
