DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a budget.

EXAMPLES
    To create a budget with the display name 'BUDGET1' in the amount of 100.75
    in the default currency ('USD'), to receive notifications when 50% of the
    current budget or 75% of the forecasted budget is spent in the account
    '123', run:

        $ gcloud alpha billing budgets create --billing-account=123 \
            --display-name="BUDGET1" --budget-amount=100.75USD \
            --threshold-rule=percent=0.50 \
            --threshold-rule=percent=0.75,basis=forecasted-spend

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Billing account resource - Billing account under which to create the
     budget. This represents a Cloud resource.

     This must be specified.

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT
          ID of the billing-account or fully qualified identifier for the
          billing-account.

          To set the billing-account attribute:
          â–¸ provide the argument --billing-account on the command line.

     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
        User data for display name in UI. Must be less than or equal to 60
        characters.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --budget-amount=BUDGET_AMOUNT
          Specify the amount of the budget. If a currency type is included, it
          must be the currency associated with the billing account. If
          excluded, the currency used will be the currency associated with the
          billing account.

       --last-period-amount
          Use the amount of last period's budget.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --all-updates-rule-monitoring-notification-channels=[ALL_UPDATES_RULE_MONITORING_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS,...]
        Targets to send notifications to when a threshold is exceeded. This is
        in addition to default recipients who have billing account IAM roles.
        The value is the full REST resource name of a monitoring notification
        channel in the form
        projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id}. A maximum of 5
        channels is allowed. See
        https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-notification-recipients
        for more details.

     --all-updates-rule-pubsub-topic=ALL_UPDATES_RULE_PUBSUB_TOPIC
        Name of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic where budget related messages will be
        published, in the form projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}.

     --credit-types-treatment=CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT
        Whether to include all credit types when calculating the actual spend
        against the budget. If this is not specified, then all credit types are
        used in the calculation. If this is set to include-specified-credits,
        then --filter-credit-types must be specified with a nonempty list of
        credits. CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT must be one of:
        credit-types-treatment-unspecified, exclude-all-credits,
        include-all-credits, include-specified-credits.

     --disable-default-iam-recipients
        When set to true, disables default notifications sent when a threshold
        is exceeded. Default notifications are sent to those with Billing
        Account Administrator and Billing Account User IAM roles for the target
        account.

     --filter-credit-types=[FILTER_CREDIT_TYPES,...]
        Set of credit types, specifying that usage from only this set of
        credits should be included in the budget. If a nonempty list is
        specified, then --credit-types-treatment must be
        include-specified-credits.

     --filter-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Single label and value pair specifying that usage from only this set of
        labeled resources should be included in the budget. Currently, multiple
        entries or multiple values per entry are not allowed. If omitted, the
        report will include all labeled and unlabeled usage.

     --filter-projects=[FILTER_PROJECTS,...]
        Set of projects in the form projects/{project_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of projects should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, all projects will be included.

     --filter-resource-ancestors=[FILTER_RESOURCE_ANCESTORS,...]
        A set of folder and organization names of the form folders/{folderId}
        or organizations/{organizationId}, specifying that usage from only this
        set of folders and organizations should be included in the budget. If
        omitted, the budget includes all usage that the billing account pays
        for. If the folder or organization contains projects that are paid for
        by a different Cloud Billing account, the budget doesn't apply to those
        projects.

     --filter-services=[FILTER_SERVICES,...]
        Set of services of the form services/{service_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of services should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, the report will include usage for all services. The service
        names are available through the Catalog API:
        https://cloud.google.com/billing/v1/how-tos/catalog-api.

     --filter-subaccounts=[FILTER_SUBACCOUNTS,...]
        Set of subaccounts of the form billingAccounts/{account_id}, specifying
        that usage from only this set of subaccounts should be included in the
        budget. If a subaccount is set to the name of the parent account, usage
        from the parent account will be included. If omitted, the report will
        include usage from the parent account and all subaccounts, if they
        exist.

     --ownership-scope=OWNERSHIP_SCOPE
        Sets the ownership scope of the budget. The ownership scope and users'
        IAM permissions determine who has full access to the budget's data.

        Must be one of: 'ALL_USERS' or 'BILLING_ACCOUNT'. Use 'ALL_USERS' to
        allow billing account- level users and project-level users to have full
        access to the budget (if the users have the required IAM permissions).
        Use 'BILLING_ACCOUNT' to allow only billing account-level users to have
        full access to the budget. Project-level users will have read-only
        access, even if they have the required IAM permissions.

        OWNERSHIP_SCOPE must be one of: all-users, billing-account,
        ownership-scope-unspecified.

     --threshold-rule=[basis=BASIS],[percent=PERCENT]
        Rule that triggers alerts (notifications of thresholds being crossed)
        when spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget. This flag
        can be repeated to provide multiple thresholds above which an alert is
        sent.

         percent
            Number between 0.0 and 1.0. This is a 1.0-based percentage; for
            example 0.5 equals 50 percent. An alert is sent for anything above
            the value set.

         basis
            Type of basis used to determine if spend has passed the threshold.
            Must be one of: 'current-spend' or 'forecasted-spend'. Behavior
            defaults to 'current-spend' if not set.

     Specify either the calendar-period or custom-period, not both.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       Calendar Period

         --calendar-period=CALENDAR_PERIOD
            Specified to track usage over recurring calendar period. If you're
            creating a budget with a custom time period, omit this flag.
            CALENDAR_PERIOD must be one of: calendar-period-unspecified, month,
            quarter, year.

       Custom Period

         --start-date=START_DATE
            Specified to track usage after any start date. This time period is
            static, it does not recur.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --end-date=END_DATE
            Specified to track usage before any end date. This time period is
            static, it does not recur. If specified, --start-date must also be
            specified.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the billingbudgets/v1beta1 API. The full documentation

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud billing budgets create

        $ gcloud beta billing budgets create
