FLAGS
     --all-updates-rule-monitoring-notification-channels=[ALL_UPDATES_RULE_MONITORING_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS,...]
        Targets to send notifications to when a threshold is exceeded. This is
        in addition to default recipients who have billing account roles. The
        value is the full REST resource name of a monitoring notification
        channel in the form
        projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id}. A maximum of 5
        channels is allowed. See
        https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-notification-recipients
        for more details.

     --all-updates-rule-pubsub-topic=ALL_UPDATES_RULE_PUBSUB_TOPIC
        Name of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic where budget related messages will be
        published, in the form projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}.

     --credit-types-treatment=CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT
        Whether to include all credit types when calculating the actual spend
        against the budget. If this is not specified, then all credit types are
        used in the calculation. If this is set to include-specified-credits,
        then --filter-credit-types must be specified with a nonempty list of
        credits. CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT must be one of:
        credit-types-treatment-unspecified, exclude-all-credits,
        include-all-credits, include-specified-credits.

     --disable-default-iam-recipients
        When set to true, disables default notifications sent when a threshold
        is exceeded. Default notifications are sent to those with Billing
        Account Administrator and Billing Account User IAM roles for the target
        account.

     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
        User data for display name in UI. Must be less than or equal to 60
        characters.

     --filter-credit-types=[FILTER_CREDIT_TYPES,...]
        Set of credit types, specifying that usage from only this set of
        credits should be included in the budget. If a nonempty list is
        specified, then --credit-types-treatment must be
        include-specified-credits.

     --filter-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Single label and value pair specifying that usage from only this set of
        labeled resources should be included in the budget. Currently, multiple
        entries or multiple values per entry are not allowed. If omitted, the
        report will include all labeled and unlabeled usage.

     --filter-projects=[FILTER_PROJECTS,...]
        Set of projects in the form projects/{project_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of projects should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, all projects will be included.

     --filter-resource-ancestors=[FILTER_RESOURCE_ANCESTORS,...]
        A set of folder and organization names of the form folders/{folderId}
        or organizations/{organizationId}, specifying that usage from only this
        set of folders and organizations should be included in the budget. If
        omitted, the budget includes all usage that the billing account pays
        for. If the folder or organization contains projects that are paid for
        by a different Cloud Billing account, the budget doesn't apply to those
        projects.

     --filter-services=[FILTER_SERVICES,...]
        Set of services of the form services/{service_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of services should be included in the budget.

        names are available through the Catalog API:
        https://cloud.google.com/billing/v1/how-tos/catalog-api.

     --filter-subaccounts=[FILTER_SUBACCOUNTS,...]
        Set of subaccounts of the form billingAccounts/{account_id}, specifying
        that usage from only this set of subaccounts should be included in the
        budget. If a subaccount is set to the name of the parent account, usage
        from the parent account will be included. If omitted, the report will
        include usage from the parent account and all subaccounts, if they
        exist.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --budget-amount=BUDGET_AMOUNT
          Specify the amount of the budget. If a currency type is included, it
          must be the existing currency associated with the budget.

       --last-period-amount
          Use the amount of last period's budget.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --calendar-period=CALENDAR_PERIOD
          Specifies to track usage over recurring calendar period. If you're
          creating a budget with a custom time period, omit this flag.
          CALENDAR_PERIOD must be one of: calendar-period-unspecified, month,
          quarter, year.

       --start-date=START_DATE
          Specifies to track usage after any start date. This time period is
          static, it does not recur.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --end-date=END_DATE
          Specifies to track usage before any end date. This time period is
          static, it does not recur. If specified, --start-date must also be

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --threshold-rules-from-file=THRESHOLD_RULES_FROM_FILE
          Import a file with the updated threshold rules. The threshold rules
          in the file will replace the rules in the budget. This can be used to
          add or remove specific threshold rules.

       --add-threshold-rule=[basis=BASIS],[percent=PERCENT]
          Rule that triggers alerts (notifications of thresholds being crossed)
          when spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget. This flag
          can be repeated to provide multiple thresholds above which an alert
          is sent.

           percent
              Integer between 0 and 100 above which an alert is sent.

           basis
              Type of basis used to determine if spend has passed the
              threshold. Must be one of: 'current-spend' or 'forecasted-spend'.
              Behavior defaults to 'current-spend' if not set.

       --clear-threshold-rules
          Removes all threshold rules from the budget.
