DESCRIPTION

EXAMPLES

    us-central1-a, run:

            --zone=us-central1-a

    OR

            projects/myproject/locations/us-central1-a/endpoints/my-ep

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Endpoint resource - endpoint. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument endpoint on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       ENDPOINT
          ID of the endpoint or fully qualified identifier for the endpoint. To
          set the endpoint attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument endpoint on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the endpoint. To set the zone attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument endpoint on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --zone on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="60m"
        Time to synchronously wait for the operation to complete, after which
        the operation continues asynchronously. Ignored if --no-async isn't
        specified. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
        formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud ids endpoints delete

        $ gcloud beta ids endpoints delete
