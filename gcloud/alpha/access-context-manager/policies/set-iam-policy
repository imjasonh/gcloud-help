    a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy.

EXAMPLES

    policy.json and sets it for the access policy with the ID
    accessPolicies/1234:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager policies set-iam-policy \
            accessPolicies/1234 policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

     Policy resource - The access policy to set the IAM policy for. This
     represents a Cloud resource.

     [POLICY]
        ID of the policy or fully qualified identifier for the policy.

        To set the policy attribute:
        ◆ provide the argument policy on the command line;
        ◆ set the property access_context_manager/policy;
        ◆ automatically, if the current account belongs to an organization
          with exactly one access policy..

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
