       Custom level specification.

         --custom-level-spec=CUSTOM_LEVEL_SPEC
            Path to a file representing an expression that represents an access
            level.

            The expression is in the Common Expression Language (CEL) format.

                  expression: "origin.region_code in ['US', 'CA']"

       Basic level specification.

         --basic-level-spec=BASIC_LEVEL_SPEC
            Path to a file containing a list of basic access level conditions.

            An access level condition file is a YAML-formatted list of
            conditions, which are YAML objects representing a Condition as
            described in the API reference. For example:

                 - ipSubnetworks:
                   - 162.222.181.197/24
                   - 2001:db8::/48
                 - members:
                   - user:user@example.com

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --combine-function=COMBINE_FUNCTION; default="and"
            For a basic level, determines how conditions are combined.
            COMBINE_FUNCTION must be one of: and, or.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
