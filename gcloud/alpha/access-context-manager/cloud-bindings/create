NAME
    gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings create - create cloud
        access bindings for a specific group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings create
        --group-key=GROUP_KEY [--dry-run-level=[DRY_RUN_LEVEL,...]]
        [--level=[LEVEL,...]] [--organization=ORGANIZATION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a new cloud access binding. The access level will be bound
    with the group. The access level will be enforced when any user in the
    group tries to access the Google cloud console or API.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new cloud access binding, run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings create \
            --group-key=my-group-key \
            --level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/abc

    To create a new cloud access binding for the dry run access level, run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings create \
            --group-key=my-group-key \
            --level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/abc \
            --dry-run-level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/def

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --group-key=GROUP_KEY
        Google Group id whose members are subject to the restrictions of this
        binding.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --dry-run-level=[DRY_RUN_LEVEL,...]
        The dry run access level that binds to the given group. The dry run
        access level will be evaluated but won't be enforced. Denial on dry run
        access level will be logged. The input must be the full identifier of
        an access level, such as accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-def.

     --level=[LEVEL,...]
        The access level that binds to the given group. The input must be the
        full identifier of an access level, such as
        accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/abc.

     --organization=ORGANIZATION
        Parent organization for this binding.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the accesscontextmanager/v1alpha API. The full
    documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud access-context-manager cloud-bindings create
