NAME
    gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings update - update an
        existing access binding under an organization

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings update
        (--binding=BINDING : --organization=ORGANIZATION) [--append]
        [--binding-file=YAML_FILE] [--dry-run-level=[DRY_RUN_LEVEL,...]]
        [--level=[LEVEL,...]]
        [--restricted-client-application-client-ids=[RESTRICTED_CLIENT_APPLICATION_CLIENT_IDS,
          ...]]
        [--restricted-client-application-names=[RESTRICTED_CLIENT_APPLICATION_NAMES,
          ...]] [--session-length=SESSION_LENGTH]
        [--session-reauth-method=SESSION_REAUTH_METHOD; default="login"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an existing access binding. You can update the level, dry
    run level, scoped access settings, session settings, restricted client
    application client IDs, and restricted client application names. They can't
    all be empty. Session settings are incompatible with restricted client
    application client IDs/names; please use scoped access settings to bind
    session settings to an application.

EXAMPLES
    To update an existing access binding, run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings update \
            --binding=my-binding-id \
            --level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-abc

    To remove level and add dry run level, run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings update \
            --binding=my-binding-id --level= \
            --dry-run-level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-def

    To update restricted client applications, run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings update \
            --binding=my-binding-id \
            --restricted-client-application-client-ids='123.apps.googleuserc\
        ontent.com' \
            --restricted-client-application-names='Cloud Console, Google
         Cloud SDK'

        Or

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings update \
            --binding=my-binding-id --binding-file='binding.yaml'

    To replace scoped access settings with a new list, run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings update \
            --binding=my-binding-id --binding-file='binding.yaml'

    To append scoped access settings to the existing list, run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings update \
            --binding=my-binding-id --binding-file='binding.yaml' --append

    Note this is only possible for scoped access settings that exclusively hold
    session settings.

    To update session settings, run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings update \
            --binding=my-binding-id --session-length=2h

    To update the session reauth method you must also specify --session-length
    (this can be the existing value if you only want to modify the reauth
    method), run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings update \
            --binding=my-binding-id --session-length=2h \
            --session-reauth-method=login

    To disable session settings, set --session-length=0, for example:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager cloud-bindings update \
            --binding=my-binding-id --session-length=0

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Cloud access binding resource - The cloud access binding you want to
     update. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource.

     This must be specified.

       --binding=BINDING
          ID of the cloud-access-binding or fully qualified identifier for the
          cloud-access-binding.

          To set the binding attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --binding on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The ID of the organization.

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --binding on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --organization on the command line;
          ▸ set the property access_context_manager/organization.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --append
        When true, append the ScopedAccessSettings in --binding-file to the
        existing ScopedAccessSettings on the binding. When false, the existing
        binding's ScopedAccessSettings will be overwritten. Defaults to false.
        You may only append ScopedAccessSettings that exclusively hold session
        settings (i.e no access levels).

     --binding-file=YAML_FILE
        Path to the file that contains a Google Cloud Platform user access
        binding.

        This file contains a YAML-compliant object representing a
        GcpUserAccessBinding (as described in the API reference) containing
        ScopedAccessSettings only. No other binding fields are allowed.

        The file content replaces the corresponding fields in the existing
        binding. Unless --append is specified. See --append help text for more
        details.

     --dry-run-level=[DRY_RUN_LEVEL,...]
        The dry run access level that replaces the existing dry run level for
        the given binding. The input must be the full identifier of an access
        level, such as accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-def.

     --level=[LEVEL,...]
        The access level that replaces the existing level for the given
        binding. The input must be the full identifier of an access level, such
        as accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-abc.

     --restricted-client-application-client-ids=[RESTRICTED_CLIENT_APPLICATION_CLIENT_IDS,...]
        The application client IDs that replace the existing application client
        IDs for the restricted client applications in the given binding.

     --restricted-client-application-names=[RESTRICTED_CLIENT_APPLICATION_NAMES,...]
        The application names that replace the existing application names for
        the restricted client applications in the given binding.

     --session-length=SESSION_LENGTH
        The maximum lifetime of a user session provided as an ISO 8601 duration
        string. Must be at least one hour or zero, and no more than twenty-four
        hours. Granularity is limited to seconds.

        When --session-length=0 users in the group attached to this binding
        will have infinite session length, effectively disabling the session
        settings.

        A session begins after a user signs in successfully. If a user signs
        out before the end of the session lifetime, a new login creates a new
        session with a fresh lifetime. When a session expires, the user is
        asked to reauthenticate in accordance with session-reauth-method.

        Setting --session-reauth-method when --session-length is empty raises
        an error. Cannot set --session-length on restricted client
        applications; please use scoped access settings.

     --session-reauth-method=SESSION_REAUTH_METHOD; default="login"
        Specifies the security check a user must undergo when their session
        expires. Defaults to --session-reauth-method=LOGIN if unspecified and
        --session-length is set. Cannot be used when --session-length is empty
        or 0. SESSION_REAUTH_METHOD must be one of:

         login
            The user will be prompted to perform regular login. Users who are
            enrolled in two-step verification and haven't chosen to "Remember
            this computer" will be prompted for their second factor.

         password
            The user will only be required to enter their password.

         security-key
            The user will be prompted to autheticate using their security key.
            If no security key has been configured, the LOGIN method is used.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the accesscontextmanager/v1alpha API. The full
    documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud access-context-manager cloud-bindings update
