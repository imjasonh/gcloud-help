DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command updates the enforced configuration (status) of a
    Service Perimeter.

EXAMPLES
    To update the enforced configuration for a Service Perimeter:

        $ gcloud alpha access-context-manager perimeters update \
            my-perimeter --add-resources="projects/123,projects/456" \
            --remove-restricted-services="storage.googleapis.com" \
            --add-access-levels="accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/a_level" \
            --enable-vpc-accessible-services --clear-vpc-allowed-services

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Perimeter resource - The service perimeter to update. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.

     This must be specified.

       PERIMETER
          ID of the perimeter or fully qualified identifier for the perimeter.
          To set the perimeter attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument perimeter on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --policy=POLICY
          The ID of the access policy. To set the policy attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument perimeter on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --policy on the command line;
          ▸ set the property access_context_manager/policy.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Long-form description of service perimeter.

     --title=TITLE
        Short human-readable title of the service perimeter.

     --type=TYPE
        Type of the perimeter.

        A regular perimeter allows resources within this service perimeter to
        import and export data amongst themselves. A project may belong to at
        most one regular service perimeter.

        A bridge perimeter allows resources in different regular service
        perimeters to import and export data between each other. A project may
        belong to multiple bridge service perimeters (only if it also belongs
        to a regular service perimeter). Both restricted and unrestricted
        service lists, as well as access level lists, must be empty.

        TYPE must be one of: bridge, regular.

     These flags modify the member access levels of this perimeter. An
     intra-perimeter request must satisfy these access levels (for example,
     MY_LEVEL; must be in the same access policy as this perimeter) to be
     allowed.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --add-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]
          Append the given values to the current access levels.

       --clear-access-levels
          Empty the current access levels.

       --remove-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]
          Remove the given values from the current access levels.

       --set-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]
          Completely replace the current access levels with the given values.

     These flags modify the member resources of this perimeter. Resources must
     be projects, in the form projects/<projectnumber>.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --add-resources=[RESOURCES,...]
          Append the given values to the current resources.

       --clear-resources
          Empty the current resources.

       --remove-resources=[RESOURCES,...]
          Remove the given values from the current resources.

       --set-resources=[RESOURCES,...]
          Completely replace the current resources with the given values.

     These flags modify the member restricted services of this perimeter. The
     perimeter boundary DOES apply to these services (for example,
     storage.googleapis.com).

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --add-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Append the given values to the current restricted services.

       --clear-restricted-services
          Empty the current restricted services.

       --remove-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Remove the given values from the current restricted services.

       --set-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Completely replace the current restricted services with the given
          values.

     These flags modify the enforced EgressPolicies of this ServicePerimeter.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-egress-policies
          Empties existing enforced Egress Policies.

       --set-egress-policies=YAML_FILE
          Path to a file containing a list of Egress Policies.

          This file contains a list of YAML-compliant objects representing
          Egress Policies described in the API reference.

          https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/accessPolicies.servicePerimeters

     These flags modify the enforced IngressPolicies of this ServicePerimeter.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-ingress-policies
          Empties existing enforced Ingress Policies.

       --set-ingress-policies=YAML_FILE
          Path to a file containing a list of Ingress Policies.

          This file contains a list of YAML-compliant objects representing
          Ingress Policies described in the API reference.

          For more information about the alpha version, see:

     --enable-vpc-accessible-services
        When specified restrict API calls within the Service Perimeter to the
        set of vpc allowed services. To disable use
        '--no-enable-vpc-accessible-services'.

     These flags modify the member vpc allowed services of this perimeter.
     Services allowed to be called within the Perimeter when VPC Accessible
     Services is enabled

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --add-vpc-allowed-services=[VPC_SERVICE,...]
          Append the given values to the current vpc allowed services.

       --clear-vpc-allowed-services
          Empty the current vpc allowed services.

       --remove-vpc-allowed-services=[VPC_SERVICE,...]
          Remove the given values from the current vpc allowed services.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud access-context-manager perimeters update

        $ gcloud beta access-context-manager perimeters update
