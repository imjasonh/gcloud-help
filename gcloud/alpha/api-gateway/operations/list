SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha api-gateway operations list [--location=LOCATION]

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List API Gateway operations.

EXAMPLES
    To list all Cloud API Gateway operations, run:

        $ gcloud alpha api-gateway operations list

    To list all Cloud API Gateway operations in the us-central1 region, run:

        $ gcloud alpha api-gateway operations list --location=us-central1

FLAGS
     Location resource - Parent location which operations will be listed from.
     This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ Location for API and API Configs. Defaults to a wildcard with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location or fully qualified identifier for the location. To
          set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ Location for API and API Configs. Defaults to a wildcard.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud api-gateway operations list

        $ gcloud beta api-gateway operations list
