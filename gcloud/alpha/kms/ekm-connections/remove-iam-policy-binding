    gcloud alpha kms ekm-connections remove-iam-policy-binding - remove IAM
        policy binding for a kms ekm connection

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha kms ekm-connections remove-iam-policy-binding
        (EKM_CONNECTION : --location=LOCATION) --member=PRINCIPAL --role=ROLE
        [--all | --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Removes a policy binding from the IAM policy of a kms ekm
    connection. A binding consists of at least one member, a role, and an
    optional condition.

EXAMPLES
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/editor' for the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' on the ekm connection laplace with location global,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha kms ekm-connections remove-iam-policy-binding \
            laplace --location='global' \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/editor'

    To remove an IAM policy binding with a condition of
    expression='request.time < timestamp("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z")',
    title='expires_end_of_2022', and description='Expires at midnight on
    2022-12-31' for the role of 'roles/editor' for the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' on the ekm connection laplace with location global,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha kms ekm-connections remove-iam-policy-binding \
            laplace --location='global' \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/editor' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2022,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2022-12-31'

    To remove all IAM policy bindings regardless of the condition for the role
    of 'roles/editor' and for the user 'test-user@gmail.com' on the ekm
    connection laplace with location global, run:

        $ gcloud alpha kms ekm-connections remove-iam-policy-binding \
            laplace --location='global' \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/editor' --all

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Ekm connection resource - The ekm connection to remove the IAM policy
     binding. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument ekm_connection on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       EKM_CONNECTION
          ID of the ekm connection or fully qualified identifier for the ekm
          connection.

          To set the ekm_connection attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument ekm_connection on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument ekm_connection on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Deleted principals have an additional deleted: prefix and a ?uid=UID
        suffix, where UID is a unique identifier for the principal. Example:
        deleted:user:test-user@gmail.com?uid=123456789012345678901.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the principal from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and principal, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding that you want to remove. When the
          condition is explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a
          binding without a condition is removed. Otherwise, only a binding
          with a condition that exactly matches the specified condition
          (including the optional description) is removed. For more on
          conditions, refer to the conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition. Use a full or
          relative path to a local file containing the value of condition.
