NAME
    gcloud alpha kms ekm-connections get-iam-policy - get the IAM policy for an
        ekm connection

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha kms ekm-connections get-iam-policy
        (EKM_CONNECTION : --location=LOCATION) [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Displays the IAM policy associated with an ekm connection. If
    formatted as JSON, the output can be edited and used as a policy file for
    set-iam-policy. The output includes an "etag" field identifying the version
    emitted and allowing detection of concurrent policy updates; see $ gcloud
    alpha kms ekm-connections set-iam-policy for additional details.

EXAMPLES
    To print the IAM policy for a given ekm connection, run:

        $ gcloud alpha kms ekm-connections get-iam-policy \
            --location=my-location my-ekmconnection

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Ekm connection resource - The ekm connection for which to get the IAM
     policy binding. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument ekm_connection on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       EKM_CONNECTION
          ID of the ekm connection or fully qualified identifier for the ekm
          connection. To set the ekm_connection attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument ekm_connection on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the resource. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument ekm_connection on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud kms ekm-connections get-iam-policy

        $ gcloud beta kms ekm-connections get-iam-policy
