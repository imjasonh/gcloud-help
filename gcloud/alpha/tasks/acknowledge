POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     TASK
        The task to acknowledge.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --schedule-time=SCHEDULE_TIME
        The task's current schedule time. This restriction is to check that the
        caller is acknowledging the correct task.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        The location where we want to manage the queue or task. If not
        specified, uses the location of the current project's App Engine app if
        there is an associated app.

     --queue=QUEUE
        The queue the task belongs to.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
