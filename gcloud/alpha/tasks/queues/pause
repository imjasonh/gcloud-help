NAME
    gcloud alpha tasks queues pause - pause a queue

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha tasks queues pause QUEUE [--location=LOCATION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) If a queue is paused then the system will stop executing the tasks
    in the queue until it is resumed. Tasks can still be added when the queue
    is paused.

EXAMPLES
    To pause a queue:

        $ gcloud alpha tasks queues pause my-queue

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     QUEUE
        The queue to pause.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        The location where we want to manage the queue or task. If not
        specified, uses the location of the current project's App Engine app if
        there is an associated app.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud tasks queues pause

        $ gcloud beta tasks queues pause
