DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) This command is deprecated. Use gcloud alpha tasks
    queues update instead

    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) Update a Cloud Tasks queue.

    This command is deprecated. Use gcloud alpha tasks queues update instead

    The flags available to this command represent the fields of a queue that
    are mutable. Attempting to use this command on a different type of queue
    will result in an error.

EXAMPLES
    To update a Cloud Tasks queue:

        $ gcloud alpha tasks queues update-app-engine-queue my-queue \
          --clear-max-attempts --clear-max-retry-duration \
          --clear-max-doublings --clear-min-backoff --clear-max-backoff \
          --clear-max-tasks-dispatched-per-second \
          --clear-max-concurrent-tasks --clear-routing-override

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     QUEUE
        The queue to update.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        The location where we want to manage the queue or task. If not
        specified, uses the location of the current project's App Engine app if
        there is an associated app.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-attempts
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-attempts.

       --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS
          The maximum number of attempts per task in the queue.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-backoff
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-backoff.

       --max-backoff=MAX_BACKOFF
          The maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it
          fails. Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-concurrent-tasks
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-concurrent-tasks.

       --max-concurrent-tasks=MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS
          The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be
          dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached,
          Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of outstanding
          requests decreases.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-doublings
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-doublings.

       --max-doublings=MAX_DOUBLINGS
          The time between retries will double maxDoublings times.

          A tasks retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles
          maxDoublings times, then increases linearly, and finally retries
          retries at intervals of maxBackoff up to maxAttempts times.

          For example, if minBackoff is 10s, maxBackoff is 300s, and
          maxDoublings is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The
          retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by
          2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of maxBackoff
          until the task has been attempted maxAttempts times. Thus, the
          requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-retry-duration
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-retry-duration.

       --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
          The time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the
          task was first run. Once the --max-retry-duration time has passed and
          the task has been attempted --max-attempts times, no further attempts
          will be made and the task will be deleted.

          Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-tasks-dispatched-per-second
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-tasks-dispatched-per-second.

       --max-tasks-dispatched-per-second=MAX_TASKS_DISPATCHED_PER_SECOND
          The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-min-backoff
          Clear the field corresponding to --min-backoff.

       --min-backoff=MIN_BACKOFF
          The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it
          fails. Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-routing-override
          Clear the field corresponding to --routing-override.

       --routing-override=KEY:VALUE,[...]
          If provided, the specified route is used for all tasks in the queue,
          no matter what is set is at the task-level.

          KEY must be at least one of: [service, version, instance]. Any
          missing keys will use the default.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta tasks queues update-app-engine-queue
