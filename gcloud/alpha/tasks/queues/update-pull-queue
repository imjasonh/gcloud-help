NAME
    gcloud alpha tasks queues update-pull-queue - update a pull queue

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha tasks queues update-pull-queue QUEUE [--location=LOCATION]
        [--clear-max-attempts | --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS]
        [--clear-max-retry-duration | --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The flags available to this command represent the fields of a pull
    queue that are mutable. Attempting to use this command on a different type
    of queue will result in an error.

    If you have early access to Cloud Tasks, refer to the following guide for
    more information about the different queue target types:
    https://cloud.google.com/cloud-tasks/docs/queue-types. For access, sign up

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     QUEUE
        The queue to update.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        The location where we want to manage the queue or task. If not
        specified, uses the location of the current project's App Engine app if
        there is an associated app.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-attempts
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-attempts.

       --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS
          The maximum number of attempts per task in the queue.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-retry-duration
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-retry-duration.

       --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
          The time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the
          task was first run. Once the --max-retry-duration time has passed and
          the task has been attempted --max-attempts times, no further attempts
          will be made and the task will be deleted.

          Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
