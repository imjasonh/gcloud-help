NAME
    gcloud alpha tasks lease - leases a list of tasks and displays them

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha tasks lease --lease-duration=LEASE_DURATION --queue=QUEUE
        [--location=LOCATION] [--oldest-tag | --tag=TAG] [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT; default=1000] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Each task returned from this command will have its schedule time
    changed based on the lease duration specified. A task that has been
    returned by calling this command will not be returned in a different call
    before its schedule time. After the work associated with a task is
    finished, the lease holder should call gcloud tasks acknowledge on the
    task.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --lease-duration=LEASE_DURATION
        The number of seconds for the desired new lease duration for all tasks
        leased, starting from now. The maximum lease duration is 1 week.

     --queue=QUEUE
        The queue the tasks belong to.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        The location where we want to manage the queue or task. If not
        specified, uses the location of the current project's App Engine app if
        there is an associated app.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --oldest-tag
          Only lease tasks which have the same tag as the task with the oldest
          schedule time.

       --tag=TAG
          A tag to filter each task to be leased. If a task has the tag and the
          task is available to be leased, then it is listed and leased.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT; default=1000
        The maximum number of tasks to lease. The maximum that can be requested
        is 1000.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
