DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create and add a task that targets a HTTP endpoint.

EXAMPLES
    To create a task:

        $ gcloud alpha tasks create-http-task --queue=my-queue
          --url=http://example.com/handler-path my-task

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [TASK_ID]
        The task to create.

        If not specified then the system will generate a random unique task ID.
        Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication. If a
        task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task that was
        deleted or completed recently then the call will fail.

        Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names,
        tasks created with IDs have significantly increased latency. Using
        hashed strings for the task ID or for the prefix of the task ID is
        recommended.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --queue=QUEUE
        The queue the task belongs to.

     --url=URL
        The full URL path that the request will be sent to. This string must
        begin with either "http://" or "https://".

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --header=HEADER_FIELD: HEADER_VALUE
        An HTTP request header. Header values can contain commas. This flag can
        be repeated. Repeated header fields will have their values overridden.

     --location=LOCATION
        The location where we want to manage the queue or task. If not
        specified, uses the location of the current project's App Engine app if
        there is an associated app.

     --method=METHOD
        The HTTP method to use for the request. If not specified, "POST" will
        be used.

     --schedule-time=SCHEDULE_TIME
        The time when the task is scheduled to be first attempted. Defaults to
        "now" if not specified.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --body-content=BODY_CONTENT
          HTTP Body data sent to the task worker processing the task.

       --body-file=BODY_FILE
          File containing HTTP body data sent to the task worker processing the
          task.

     How the request sent to the target when executing the task should be
     authenticated.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       OAuth2

         --oauth-service-account-email=OAUTH_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
            The service account email to be used for generating an OAuth2
            access token to be included in the request sent to the target when
            executing the task. The service account must be within the same
            project as the queue. The caller must have
            'iam.serviceAccounts.actAs' permission for the service account.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --oauth-token-scope=OAUTH_TOKEN_SCOPE
            The scope to be used when generating an OAuth2 access token to be
            included in the request sent to the target when executing the task.
            If not specified, 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'
            will be used.

       OpenId Connect

         --oidc-service-account-email=OIDC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
            The service account email to be used for generating an OpenID
            Connect token to be included in the request sent to the target when
            executing the task. The service account must be within the same
            project as the queue. The caller must have
            'iam.serviceAccounts.actAs' permission for the service account.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --oidc-token-audience=OIDC_TOKEN_AUDIENCE
            The audience to be used when generating an OpenID Connect token to
            be included in the request sent to the target when executing the
            task. If not specified, the URI specified in the target will be
            used.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud tasks create-http-task

        $ gcloud beta tasks create-http-task
