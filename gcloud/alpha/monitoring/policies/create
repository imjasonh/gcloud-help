DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates a new alerting policy. An alert policy can be specified as
    a JSON/YAML value passed in as a string through the --policy flag or as a
    file through the --policy-from-file flag. A basic policy can also be
    specified through command line flags. If a policy is specified through
    --policy or --policy-from-file, and additional flags are supplied, the
    flags will override the policy's settings and a specified condition will be
    appended to the list of conditions.

    For information about the JSON/YAML format of an alerting policy:
    https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.alertPolicies

FLAGS
     Notification Channel resource - Names of one or more Notification Channels
     to be added to the policy. These should be the resource names (not the
     display name) of the channels. Acceptable formats are:

      ◆ Channel Name: my-channel
        ▸ The project specified through --project or the default project
          defined by the core/project property will be used, in that order.
      ◆ Channel Relative Name:
        projects/my-project/notificationChannels/channel-id0
      ◆ Channel URI:
        https://monitoring.googleapis.com/v3/projects/my-project/notificationChannels/channel-id0
        This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
        arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --notification-channels on the command line with
        a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       --notification-channels=[NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS,...]
          IDs of the Notification Channels or fully qualified identifiers for
          the Notification Channels.

          To set the notification_channels attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --notification-channels on the command line.

     Condition Settings. This will add a condition to the created policy. If
     any conditions are already specified, this condition will be appended.

       --aggregation=AGGREGATION
          Specifies an Aggregation message as a JSON/YAML value to be applied
          to the condition. For more information about the format:
          https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.alertPolicies

       --condition-display-name=CONDITION_DISPLAY_NAME
          The display name for the condition.

       --condition-filter=CONDITION_FILTER
          Specifies the "filter" in a metric absence or metric threshold
          condition.

       --duration=DURATION
          The duration (e.g. "60s", "2min", etc.) that the condition must hold
          in order to trigger as true.

       --if=IF_VALUE
          One of "absent", "< THRESHOLD", "> THRESHOLD" where "THRESHOLD" is an
          integer or float.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --trigger-count=TRIGGER_COUNT
            The absolute number of time series that must fail the predicate for
            the condition to be triggered.

         --trigger-percent=TRIGGER_PERCENT
            The percentage of time series that must fail the predicate for the
            condition to be triggered.

     Policy Settings. If any of these are specified, they will overwrite fields
     in the --policy or --policy-from-file flags if specified.

       --combiner=COMBINER
          The combiner for the Alert Policy. COMBINER must be one of:

           AND
              An incident is created only if all conditions are met
              simultaneously. This combiner is satisfied if all conditions are
              met, even if they are met on completely different resources.
           AND_WITH_MATCHING_RESOURCE
              Combine conditions using logical AND operator, but unlike the
              regular AND option, an incident is created only if all conditions
              are met simultaneously on at least one resource.
           COMBINE_UNSPECIFIED
              An unspecified combiner
           OR
              An incident is created if any of the listed conditions is met.

       --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
          The display name for the Alert Policy.

       --enabled
          If the policy is enabled. Enabled by default, use --no-enabled to
          disable.

       --user-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

          Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
          (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
          contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
          numbers.

          If the policy was given as a JSON/YAML object from a string or file,
          this flag will replace the labels value in the given policy.

       Documentation

         --documentation-format=DOCUMENTATION_FORMAT; default="text/markdown"
            The MIME type that should be used with --documentation or
            --documentation-from-file. Currently, only "text/markdown" is
            supported.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --documentation=DOCUMENTATION
              The documentation to be included with the policy.

           --documentation-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
              The path to a file containing the documentation to be included
              with the policy. Use a full or relative path to a local file
              containing the value of documentation.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --policy=POLICY
          The policy as a string. In either JSON or YAML format.

       --policy-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          The path to a JSON or YAML file containing the policy. Use a full or
          relative path to a local file containing the value of policy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
