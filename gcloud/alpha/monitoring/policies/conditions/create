DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a condition in an alerting policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Alert Policy resource - Name of the Alert Policy to add a condition to.
     This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument alert_policy on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       ALERT_POLICY
          ID of the Alert Policy or fully qualified identifier for the Alert
          Policy.

          To set the policy attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument alert_policy on the command line.

FLAGS
     Condition Settings. This will add a condition to the created policy. If
     any conditions are already specified, this condition will be appended.

       --aggregation=AGGREGATION
          Specifies an Aggregation message as a JSON/YAML value to be applied
          to the condition. For more information about the format:
          https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.alertPolicies

       --condition-display-name=CONDITION_DISPLAY_NAME
          The display name for the condition.

       --condition-filter=CONDITION_FILTER
          Specifies the "filter" in a metric absence or metric threshold
          condition.

       --duration=DURATION
          The duration (e.g. "60s", "2min", etc.) that the condition must hold
          in order to trigger as true.

       --if=IF_VALUE
          One of "absent", "< THRESHOLD", "> THRESHOLD" where "THRESHOLD" is an
          integer or float.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --trigger-count=TRIGGER_COUNT
            The absolute number of time series that must fail the predicate for
            the condition to be triggered.

         --trigger-percent=TRIGGER_PERCENT
            The percentage of time series that must fail the predicate for the
            condition to be triggered.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --condition=CONDITION
          The condition as a string. In either JSON or YAML format.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          The path to a JSON or YAML file containing the condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
