DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Updates an alerting policy.

    If --policy or --policy-from-file are specified:

      ▪ If --fields is specified, the only the specified fields will be
        updated.
      ▪ Else, the policy will be replaced with the provided policy. The
        policy can be modified further using the flags from the Policy Settings
        group below.

    Otherwise, the policy will be updated with the values specified in the
    flags from the Policy Settings group.

    For information about the JSON/YAML format of an alerting policy:
    https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.alertPolicies

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Alert Policy resource - Name of the Alert Policy to be updated. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument alert_policy on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       ALERT_POLICY
          ID of the Alert Policy or fully qualified identifier for the Alert
          Policy.

          To set the policy attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument alert_policy on the command line.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --fields=[field,...]
          The list of fields to update. Must specify --policy or
          --policy-from-file if using this flag. field must be one of:
          disabled, notificationChannels.

       Policy Settings. If any of these are specified, they will overwrite
       fields in the --policy or --policy-from-file flags if specified.

         --combiner=COMBINER
            The combiner for the Alert Policy. COMBINER must be one of:

             AND
                An incident is created only if all conditions are met
                simultaneously. This combiner is satisfied if all conditions
                are met, even if they are met on completely different
                resources.
             AND_WITH_MATCHING_RESOURCE
                Combine conditions using logical AND operator, but unlike the
                regular AND option, an incident is created only if all
                conditions are met simultaneously on at least one resource.
             COMBINE_UNSPECIFIED
                An unspecified combiner
             OR
                An incident is created if any of the listed conditions is met.

         --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
            The display name for the Alert Policy.

         --[no-]enabled
            If the policy is enabled. Use --enabled to enable and --no-enabled
            to disable.

         These flags modify the member Notification Channels of this Alert
         Policy.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --add-notification-channels=[NOTIFICATION-CHANNELS,...]
              Append the given values to the current Notification Channels.

           --clear-notification-channels
              Empty the current Notification Channels.

           --remove-notification-channels=[NOTIFICATION-CHANNELS,...]
              Remove the given values from the current Notification Channels.

           --set-notification-channels=[NOTIFICATION-CHANNELS,...]
              Completely replace the current Notification Channels with the
              given values.

         Documentation

           --documentation-format=DOCUMENTATION_FORMAT
              The MIME type that should be used with --documentation or
              --documentation-from-file. Currently, only "text/markdown" is
              supported.

           At most one of these can be specified:

             --documentation=DOCUMENTATION
                The documentation to be included with the policy.

             --documentation-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
                The path to a file containing the documentation to be included
                with the policy. Use a full or relative path to a local file
                containing the value of documentation.

         User Labels

           --update-user-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
              List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its
              value is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

              Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only
              hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers.
              Values must contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase
              characters, and numbers.

           At most one of these can be specified:

             --clear-user-labels
                Remove all labels. If --update-user-labels is also specified
                then --clear-user-labels is applied first.

                For example, to remove all labels:

                    $ gcloud alpha monitoring policies update --clear-user-labels

                To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo
                and baz:

                    $ gcloud alpha monitoring policies update --clear-user-labels \
                      --update-user-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

             --remove-user-labels=[KEY,...]
                List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
                silently ignored. If --update-user-labels is also specified
                then --update-user-labels is applied first.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --policy=POLICY
          The policy as a string. In either JSON or YAML format.

       --policy-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          The path to a JSON or YAML file containing the policy. Use a full or
          relative path to a local file containing the value of policy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES

    access allowlist.
