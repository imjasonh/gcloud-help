NAME
    gcloud alpha monitoring channels create - create a new notification channel

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha monitoring channels create
        [--channel-content=CHANNEL_CONTENT
          | --channel-content-from-file=CHANNEL_CONTENT_FROM_FILE]
        [--channel-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...] --description=DESCRIPTION
          --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
          --no-enabled --type=TYPE --user-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates a new notification channel. A channel can be specified as
    JSON/YAML passed in as a string through the --channel-content flag or as a
    file through the --channel-content-from-file flag. A basic channel can also
    be specified through command line flags. If a channel is specified through
    --channel-content or --channel-content-from-file, and additional flags are
    supplied, the flags will override the given channel's settings.

    For information about the JSON/YAML format of a notification channel:
    https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannels

    Additional documentation can for this operation can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/using-channels-api

EXAMPLES
    The following commands setup both email and SMS notification channels for
    the team lead. Note that the display name and description focus on the
    purpose/semantics of the channel rather than its destination. This is a
    best-practice that facilitates swapping/updating notification channels
    in-place (such as when users change teams, projects, roles, companies,
    etc.) with minimal impact to the alerting policies that reference the
    existing channels. It is also a best practice to supply at least two
    channels of different types for a given person.

        $ gcloud alpha monitoring channels create \
            --display-name="Foo Team Lead (Primary)" \
            --description="Primary contact method for the Foo team lead" \
            --type=email --user-labels=team=foo,role=lead,ord=1 \
            --channel-labels=email_address=user@somedomain.tld

        $ gcloud alpha monitoring channels create \
            --display-name="Foo Team Lead (Secondary)" \
            --description="Secondary contact method for the Foo team lead" \
            --type=sms --user-labels=team=foo,role=lead,ord=2 \
            --channel-labels=number=123-456-7890

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --channel-content=CHANNEL_CONTENT
          The channel-content as a string. In either JSON or YAML format.

       --channel-content-from-file=CHANNEL_CONTENT_FROM_FILE
          The path to a JSON or YAML file containing the channel-content.

     Notification channel settings

       --channel-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

          Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
          (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers.

          These are configuration fields that define the channel and its
          behavior.If the channel was given as a JSON/YAML object from a string
          or file, this flag will replace the labels value in the given
          channel.

       --description=DESCRIPTION
          An optional description for the channel.

       --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
          The display name for the channel.

       --enabled
          Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel. Enabled
          by default, use --no-enabled to disable.

       --type=TYPE
          The type of the notification channel. This field matches the value of
          the NotificationChannelDescriptor type field.

       --user-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

          Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
          (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
          contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
          numbers.

          If the channel was given as a JSON/YAML object from a string or file,
          this flag will replace the labels value in the given channel.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta monitoring channels create
