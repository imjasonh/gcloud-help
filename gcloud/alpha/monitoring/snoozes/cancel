NAME
    gcloud alpha monitoring snoozes cancel - cancels a snooze

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha monitoring snoozes cancel SNOOZE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Cancels a snooze.

    If the snooze is upcoming, i.e. the start time is in the future, then this
    command is equivalent to:

      ▪ update --start-time="+PT1S" --end-time="+PT1S

    Otherwise, if the snooze is active, i.e. the start time is past and the
    ending time is in the future, then this command is equivalent to:

      ▪ update --end-time="+PT1S

    For information about the JSON/YAML format of a snooze:

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Snooze resource - Name of the Snooze to be canceled. This represents a
     Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument snooze on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SNOOZE
          ID of the Snooze or fully qualified identifier for the Snooze. To set
          the snooze attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument snooze on the command line.

    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
