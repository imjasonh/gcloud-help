NAME
    gcloud alpha monitoring metrics-scopes delete - delete a monitored project
        in a metrics scope

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha monitoring metrics-scopes delete
        MONITORED_RESOURCE_CONTAINER_NAME [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The projects specified do not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access one of the
        given project.

    More details can be found at
    https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v1/locations.global.metricsScopes.projects/delete

EXAMPLES
    The following command adds a monitored project with the ID
    monitored-project-1 to a metrics scope with project id metrics-scope-1
    assuming the metrics-scope-1 is the default project:

        $ gcloud alpha monitoring metrics-scopes delete \
            projects/monitored-project-1

    The following command adds a monitored project with the ID
    monitored-project-1 to a metrics scope with project id metrics-scope-1:

        $ gcloud alpha monitoring metrics-scopes delete \
            projects/monitored-project-1 --project=metrics-scope-1
        $ gcloud alpha monitoring metrics-scopes delete \
            locations/global/metricsScopes/metrics-scope-1/projects/\
        monitored-project-1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     MONITORED_RESOURCE_CONTAINER_NAME
        Monitored resource container (example - projects/PROJECT_ID) project
        you want to delete.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta monitoring metrics-scopes delete
