NAME
    gcloud alpha monitoring metrics-scopes create - create a monitored project
        in a metrics scope

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha monitoring metrics-scopes create
        MONITORED_PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The projects specified do not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access one of the
        given project.
      ▪ The monitored project already exists in the metrics scope.

    More details can be found at
    https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v1/locations.global.metricsScopes.projects/create

EXAMPLES
    The following command adds a monitored project with the ID
    monitored-project-1 to a metrics scope with project id metrics-scope-1
    assuming the metrics-scope-1 is the default project:

        $ gcloud alpha monitoring metrics-scopes create monitored-project-1

    The following command adds a monitored project with the ID
    monitored-project-1 to a metrics scope with project id metrics-scope-1:

        $ gcloud alpha monitoring metrics-scopes create \
            monitored-project-1 --project=metrics-scope-1
        $ gcloud alpha monitoring metrics-scopes create \
            locations/global/metricsScopes/metrics-scope-1/projects/\
        monitored-project-1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     MONITORED_PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER
        Monitored project ID or number for the project you want to create.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
