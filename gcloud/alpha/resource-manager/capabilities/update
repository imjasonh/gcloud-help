NAME
    gcloud alpha resource-manager capabilities update - update a folder
        capability

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha resource-manager capabilities update CAPABILITY_ID
        --[no-]enable [--update-mask=UPDATE_MASK] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Command to Update/Set the value field of the Folder capability.
    This can be done by using the --enable flag to set the value to True, and
    the --no-enable flag to set the value to False.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ There is no folder parenting the given capability name.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to update the given
        folder/capability.

EXAMPLES
    The following command updates a capability with the ID
    folders/123/capabilities/app-management to have the value True:

        $ gcloud alpha resource-manager capabilities update \
            "folders/123/capabilities/app-management" --enable

    In order to set the value to False, the following command can be used:

        $ gcloud alpha resource-manager capabilities update \
            "folders/123/capabilities/app-management" --no-enable

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CAPABILITY_ID
        ID for the capability you want to update.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --[no-]enable
        Enable the Capability. Use --enable to enable and --no-enable to
        disable.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --update-mask=UPDATE_MASK
        Update Mask. This is an optional field, and the only valid value this
        can be set to currently is "value".

    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud resource-manager capabilities update

        $ gcloud beta resource-manager capabilities update
