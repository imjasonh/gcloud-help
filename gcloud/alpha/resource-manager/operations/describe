NAME
    gcloud alpha resource-manager operations describe - show metadata for an
        operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha resource-manager operations describe OPERATION_ID
        [--location=LOCATION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Show metadata for an operation, given a valid operation ID.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The operation specified does not exist.
      ▪ You do not have permission to view the operation.

EXAMPLES
    The following command prints metadata for an operation with the ID
    fc.3589215982:

        $ gcloud alpha resource-manager operations describe fc.3589215982

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION_ID
        ID for the operation you want to describe.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        Region or zone of the Operation to get. This field is not required if
        the Operation is on a global resource such as a Project or TagKey.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
