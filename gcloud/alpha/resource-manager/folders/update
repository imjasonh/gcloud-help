        --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

    This command can fail for the following reasons:

      ▪ The active account does not have permission to update the given
        folder.
      ▪ The new display name is taken by another folder under this folder's
        parent.

EXAMPLES
    The following command updates a folder with the ID 123456789 to have the
    name "Foo Bar and Grill":

        $ gcloud alpha resource-manager folders update 123456789 \
            --display-name="Foo Bar and Grill"

    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud resource-manager folders update

        $ gcloud beta resource-manager folders update
