NAME
    gcloud alpha resource-manager folders describe - show metadata for a folder

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha resource-manager folders describe FOLDER_ID
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Shows metadata for a folder, given a valid folder ID.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The folder specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access the given
        folder.

EXAMPLES
    The following command prints metadata for a folder with the ID 3589215982:

        $ gcloud alpha resource-manager folders describe 3589215982

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FOLDER_ID
        ID for the folder you want to describe.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud resource-manager folders describe

        $ gcloud beta resource-manager folders describe
