SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha resource-manager folders get-iam-policy FOLDER

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha resource-manager folders get-iam-policy displays the
    IAM policy associated with a folder. If formatted as JSON, the output can
    be edited and used as a policy file for set-iam-policy. The output includes
    an "etag" field identifying the version emitted and allowing detection of
    concurrent policy updates; see $ {parent} set-iam-policy for additional
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To print the IAM policy for a given folder, run:

        $ gcloud alpha resource-manager folders get-iam-policy my-folder

     policy. This represents a Cloud resource.

          ID of the folder or fully qualified identifier for the folder.

          To set the folder attribute:
          â–¸ provide the argument folder on the command line.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
