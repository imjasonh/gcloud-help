NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud resource-manager folders set-iam-policy

        $ gcloud beta resource-manager folders set-iam-policy
