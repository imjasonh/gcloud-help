POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Firewall policy resource - The reCAPTCHA firewall policy to update. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument firewall_policy on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

          ID of the firewall_policy or fully qualified identifier for the

FLAGS
     --actions=ACTIONS
        The actions that the caller should take regarding the user. There
        should be at most 1 terminal action. A terminal action is any action
        that forces a response, such as Allow, Block or Substitute. If it makes
        sense for it to happen multple times, such as SetHeader, the action is
        non-terminal.

        Examples:
        ◆ Block and set the header with key foo to value bar
          ▸ --actions=block,set_header=foo=bar
        ◆ Substitute with path google.com and set two headers, one with key
          key1 to value value1 and one with key key2 to value value2
          ▸ --actions=substitute=google.com,set_header=key1=value1,set_header=key2=value2

     --condition=CONDITION
        A CEL (Common Expression Language) conditional expression that
        specifies if this policy applies to an incoming user request. If this
        condition evaluates to true and the requested path matched the path
        pattern, the associated actions should be executed by the caller. The
        condition string is checked for CEL syntax correctness on creation. For
        more information, see the CEL spec: https://github.com/google/cel-spec
        and its language definition:
        https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A description of what this policy aims to achieve, for convenience
        purposes. The description can at most include 256 UTF-8 characters.

     --path=PATH
        The path for which this policy applies, specified as a glob pattern.
        For more information on glob, see the manual page:
        https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html.
