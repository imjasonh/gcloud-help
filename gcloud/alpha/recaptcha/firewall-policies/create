NAME
    gcloud alpha recaptcha firewall-policies create - create a Firewall Policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha recaptcha firewall-policies create [--actions=ACTIONS]
        [--condition=CONDITION] [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--path=PATH]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a reCAPTCHA Firewall Policy.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new reCAPTCHA firewall policy covering the path "/login/" for
    all requests with a reCAPTCHA Lite score of >= 0.5 to allow the requests
    and set the header 'foo' to the value 'bar':

        $ gcloud alpha recaptcha firewall-policies create \
            --path='/login/*' \
            --condition='recaptcha.assessment_type == AssessmentType.LITE
        && recaptcha.score >= 0.5' --actions=allow,set_header=foo=bar

FLAGS
     --actions=ACTIONS
        The actions that the caller should take regarding the user. There
        should be at most 1 terminal action. A terminal action is any action
        that forces a response, such as Allow, Block or Substitute. If it makes
        sense for it to happen multple times, such as SetHeader, the action is
        non-terminal.

        Examples:
        ◆ Block and set the header with key foo to value bar
          ▸ --actions=block,set_header=foo=bar
        ◆ Substitute with path google.com and set two headers, one with key
          key1 to value value1 and one with key key2 to value value2
          ▸ --actions=substitute=google.com,set_header=key1=value1,set_header=key2=value2

     --condition=CONDITION
        A CEL (Common Expression Language) conditional expression that
        specifies if this policy applies to an incoming user request. If this
        condition evaluates to true and the requested path matched the path
        pattern, the associated actions should be executed by the caller. The
        condition string is checked for CEL syntax correctness on creation. For
        more information, see the CEL spec: https://github.com/google/cel-spec
        and its language definition:
        https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A description of what this policy aims to achieve, for convenience
        purposes. The description can at most include 256 UTF-8 characters.

     --path=PATH
        The path for which this policy applies, specified as a glob pattern.
        For more information on glob, see the manual page:
        https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html.
