NAME
    gcloud alpha auth login - authorize gcloud to access the Cloud Platform
        with Google user credentials

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth login [ACCOUNT] [--no-activate] [--brief] [--no-browser]
        [--cred-file=CRED_FILE] [--enable-gdrive-access] [--force]
        [--no-launch-browser] [--login-config=LOGIN_CONFIG] [--update-adc]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Obtains access credentials for your user account via a web-based
    authorization flow. When this command completes successfully, it sets the
    active account in the current configuration to the account specified. If no
    configuration exists, it creates a configuration named default.

    If valid credentials for an account are already available from a prior
    authorization, the account is set to active without rerunning the flow.

    Use gcloud auth list to view credentialed accounts.

    If you'd rather authorize without a web browser but still interact with the
    command line, use the --no-browser flag. To authorize without a web browser
    and non-interactively, create a service account with the appropriate scopes
    using the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com) and use
    gcloud auth activate-service-account with the corresponding JSON key file.

    In addition to Google user credentials, authorization using workload
    identity federation, workforce identity federation, or service account keys
    is also supported.

    For authorization with external accounts or service accounts, the
    --cred-file flag must be specified with the path to the workload identity
    credential configuration file or service account key file (JSON).

    Login with workload and workforce identity federation is also supported in
    both gsutil and bq. This command is the recommended way of using external
    accounts.

    For more information on workload identity federation, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation.

    For more information on workforce identity federation, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation.

    For more information on authorization and credential types, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing.

EXAMPLES
    To obtain access credentials for your user account, run:

        $ gcloud alpha auth login

    To obtain access credentials using workload or workforce identity
    federation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha auth login --cred-file=/path/to/configuration/file

    To obtain access credentials using a browser-based sign-in flow with
    workforce identity federation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha auth login --login-config=/path/to/configuration/file

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [ACCOUNT]
        User account used for authorization. When the account specified has
        valid credentials in the local credential store these credentials will
        be re-used, otherwise a new credential will be fetched. If you need to
        fetch a new credential for an account with valid credentials stored,
        run the command with the --force flag.

FLAGS
     --activate
        Set the new account to active. Enabled by default, use --no-activate to
        disable.

     --brief
        Minimal user output.

     --no-browser
        If you want to authorize the gcloud CLI on a machine that doesn't have
        a browser and you can install the gcloud CLI on another machine with a
        browser, use the --no-browser flag.

        1. To initiate authorization, enter the following command:

            gcloud auth login --no-browser

        2. Copy the long command that begins with gcloud auth login
        --remote-bootstrap=".

        3. Paste and run this command on the command line of a different,
        trusted machine that has local installations of both a web browser and
        the gcloud CLI tool version 372.0 or later.

        4. Copy the long URL output from the machine with the web browser.

        5. Paste the long URL back to the first machine under the prompt,
        "Enter the output of the above command", and press Enter to complete
        the authorization.

     --cred-file=CRED_FILE
        Path to the external account configuration file (workload identity
        pool, generated by the Cloud Console or gcloud iam
        workload-identity-pools create-cred-config) or service account
        credential key file (JSON).

     --enable-gdrive-access
        Enable Google Drive access.

     --force
        Re-run the web authorization flow even if the given account has valid
        credentials.

     --launch-browser
        Launch a browser for authorization. If not enabled or if it is not
        possible to launch a browser, prints a URL to standard output to be
        copied.

        If you want to authorize the gcloud CLI on a machine that doesn't have
        a browser and you cannot install the gcloud CLI on another machine with
        a browser, use the --no-launch-browser flag. The --no-launch-browser
        flag prevents the command from automatically opening a web browser.

        1. To initiate authorization, enter the following command:

            gcloud auth login --no-launch-browser

        2. Copy the long URL that begins with
        https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth...

        3. Paste this URL into the browser of a different, trusted machine that
        has a web browser.

        4. Copy the authorization code from the machine with the web browser.

        5. Paste the authorization code back to the first machine at the
        prompt, "Enter authorization code", and press Enter to complete the
        authorization.

        Enabled by default, use --no-launch-browser to disable.

     --login-config=LOGIN_CONFIG
        Path to the workforce identity federation login configuration file
        which can be generated using the gcloud iam workforce-pools
        create-login-config command. Overrides the default
        auth/login_config_file property value for this command invocation.

     --update-adc
        Write the obtained credentials to the well-known location for
        Application Default Credentials (ADC). Run $ gcloud auth
        application-default --help to learn more about ADC. Any credentials
        previously generated by gcloud auth application-default login will be
        overwritten.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud auth login

        $ gcloud beta auth login
