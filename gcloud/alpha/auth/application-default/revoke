NAME
    gcloud alpha auth application-default revoke - revoke previously generated
        Application Default Credentials

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth application-default revoke [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Revokes Application Default Credentials that have been previously
    generated by gcloud alpha auth application-default login and deletes the
    local credential file.

    This does not affect any credentials set up through other means, such as
    credentials referenced by the Application Default Credentials environment
    variable or service account credentials that are active on a Google Compute
    Engine virtual machine.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud auth application-default revoke

        $ gcloud beta auth application-default revoke
