NAME
    gcloud alpha auth - manage oauth2 credentials for the Google Cloud CLI

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The gcloud auth command group lets you grant and revoke
    authorization to Google Cloud CLI (gcloud CLI) to access Google Cloud.
    Typically, when scripting Google Cloud CLI tools for use on multiple
    machines, using gcloud auth activate-service-account is recommended.

    For information about authorization and credential types, see Authorizing
    the gcloud CLI (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing). For
    information about authorizing a service account, see Authorizing with a
    service account
    (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#authorizing_with_a_service_account).

    After running gcloud auth commands, you can run other commands with
    --account=ACCOUNT to authenticate the command with the credentials of the
    specified account. For information about --account and other gcloud CLI
    global flags, see the gcloud CLI overview
    (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference).

EXAMPLES
    To authenticate a user account with gcloud and minimal user output, run:

        $ gcloud auth login --brief

    To list all credentialed accounts and identify the current active account,
    run:

        $ gcloud auth list

    To revoke credentials for a user account (like logging out), run:

        $ gcloud auth revoke test@gmail.com

    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
