NAME
    gcloud alpha ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding - remove IAM
        policy binding for a model

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding MODEL
        --member=PRINCIPAL --role=ROLE [--region=REGION]
        [--all | --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Remove an IAM policy binding from the IAM policy of a ML model. One
    binding consists of a member, a role, and an optional condition. See $
    gcloud alpha ai-platform models get-iam-policy for examples of how to
    specify a model resource.

EXAMPLES
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' for the
    user 'test-user@gmail.com' on model with identifier 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my_model --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/ml.admin'

    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' from all
    authenticated users on model 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my_model --member='allAuthenticatedUsers' \
            --role='roles/ml.admin'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Model resource - The AI Platform model for which to remove IAM policy
     binding from. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are
     not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument model on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       MODEL
          ID of the model or fully qualified identifier for the model.

          To set the name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument model on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Deleted principals have an additional deleted: prefix and a ?uid=UID
        suffix, where UID is a unique identifier for the principal. Example:
        deleted:user:test-user@gmail.com?uid=123456789012345678901.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the principal from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Google Cloud region of the regional endpoint to use for this command.
        For the global endpoint, the region needs to be specified as global.

        Learn more about regional endpoints and see a list of available
        regions:
        https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs/regional-endpoints

        REGION must be one of: global, asia-east1, asia-northeast1,
        asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-west1, europe-west2,
        europe-west3, europe-west4, northamerica-northeast1, us-central1,
        us-east1, us-east4, us-west1.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and principal, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding that you want to remove. When the
          condition is explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a
          binding without a condition is removed. Otherwise, only a binding
          with a condition that exactly matches the specified condition
          (including the optional description) is removed. For more on
          conditions, refer to the conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding

        $ gcloud beta ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding
