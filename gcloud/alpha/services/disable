SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha services disable SERVICE [SERVICE ...] [--async]
        [--bypass-api-usage-check] [--force] [--validate-only]
        [--bypass-dependency-service-check | --disable-dependency-services]
        [--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command disables one or more previously-enabled services for
    consumption.

    To see a list of the enabled services for a project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha services list

    More information on listing services can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/list-services and on disabling
    a service at: https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable

EXAMPLES
    To disable a service called my-consumed-service for the current project,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha services disable my-consumed-service

    To disable a service called my-consumed-service for the project my-project,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha services disable my-consumed-service \
            --project=my-project

    To disable a service called my-consumed-service for the folder my-folder,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha services disable my-consumed-service \
            --folder=my-folder

    To disable a service called my-consumed-service for the organization
    my-organization, run:

        $ gcloud alpha services disable my-consumed-service \
            --organization=my-organization

    To run the same command asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud alpha services disable my-consumed-service --async

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE [SERVICE ...]
        The name of the service(s) to disable.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --bypass-api-usage-check
        If specified, the system will bypass usage checks for services that are
        being removed. Otherwise, the system will check if the service to be
        removed was used in the last 30 days or enabled in the last 3 days. If
        so, the system will return an error.

     --force
        If specified, the disable call will proceed even if there are enabled
        services which depend on the service to be disabled, or the service to
        be disabled was used in the last 30 days, or the service to be disabled
        was enabled in the last 3 days. Forcing the call means that the
        services which depend on the service to be disabled will also be
        disabled. (Note): If --bypass-api-usage-check,
        --bypass-dependency-service-check, or --disable-dependency-services
        flags are used, they will take precedence over --force.

     --validate-only
        Validate the disable action, but don't actually perform it

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --bypass-dependency-service-check
          If specified, the disable call will bypass the check for dependencies
          and the dependencies will remain enabled.

       --disable-dependency-services
          If specified, the disable call will proceed disabling the service and
          all the enabled services depend on the service to be disabled

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform folder ID to use for this invocation.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform organization ID to use for this invocation.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud services disable

        $ gcloud beta services disable
