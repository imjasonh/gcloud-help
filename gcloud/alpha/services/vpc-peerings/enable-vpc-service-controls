NAME
    gcloud alpha services vpc-peerings enable-vpc-service-controls - enable VPC
        Service Controls for the peering connection

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha services vpc-peerings enable-vpc-service-controls
        --network=NETWORK [--async]
        [--service=SERVICE; default="servicenetworking.googleapis.com"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command enables VPC Service Controls for the peering
    connection.

    The local default route (destination 0.0.0.0/0, next hop default internet
    gateway) is deleted in the service producer VPC network. After deletion,
    the service producer VPC network can import a custom default route from the
    peering connection to the customer VPC network. This requires that the
    customer VPC network be configured to export custom routes. The custom
    default route cannot have an associated network tag.

EXAMPLES
    To enable VPC Service Controls for a connection peering a network called
    my-network on the current project to a service called your-service, run:

        $ gcloud alpha services vpc-peerings enable-vpc-service-controls \
            --network=my-network --service=your-service

    To run the same command asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud alpha services vpc-peerings enable-vpc-service-controls \
            --network=my-network --service=your-service --async

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The network in the current project that is peered with the service.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --service=SERVICE; default="servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
        The service to enable VPC service controls for.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud services vpc-peerings enable-vpc-service-controls

        $ gcloud beta services vpc-peerings enable-vpc-service-controls
