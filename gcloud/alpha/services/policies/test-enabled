NAME
    gcloud alpha services policies test-enabled - test a value against the
        result of merging consumer policies in the resource hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha services policies test-enabled SERVICE
        [--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Test a value against the result of merging consumer policies in the
    resource hierarchy.

EXAMPLES
    Test for service my-service for current project:

        $ gcloud alpha services policies test-enabled my-service

    Test for service my-service for project my-project:

        $ gcloud alpha services policies test-enabled my-service \
            --project=my-project

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE
        Name of the service.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform folder ID to use for this invocation.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform organization ID to use for this invocation.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
