NAME
    gcloud alpha pubsub lite-subscriptions seek - seek a Pub/Sub Lite
        subscription

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha pubsub lite-subscriptions seek
        (SUBSCRIPTION : --location=LOCATION)
        (--event-time=EVENT_TIME | --publish-time=PUBLISH_TIME
          | --starting-offset=STARTING_OFFSET) [--async] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Initiate an out-of-band seek operation for a Pub/Sub Lite
    subscription to a specified target, which may be timestamps or named
    locations within the message backlog.

    The seek operation will complete once subscriber clients react to the seek
    for all partitions of the topic. Note that the seek operation will not
    complete until subscribers are online. It may take some time (usually
    within 30 seconds) for the seek to propagate if subscribers are online. Use
    the --async flag if it's not necessary to wait for completion.

EXAMPLES
    To seek a Pub/Sub Lite subscription to the beginning of the message
    backlog, run:

        $ gcloud alpha pubsub lite-subscriptions seek mysubscription \
            --location=us-central1-a \
            --starting-offset=beginning

    To seek a Pub/Sub Lite subscription to a publish time without waiting for
    the operation to complete, run:

        $ gcloud alpha pubsub lite-subscriptions seek mysubscription \
            --location=us-central1-a \
            --publish-time="2021-01-01T12:00:00Z"
            --async

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - Subscription to seek. The arguments in this group
     can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument subscription on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          ID of the subscription or fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription. To set the subscription attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument subscription on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location of the Pub/Sub Lite resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument subscription on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --event-time=EVENT_TIME
          The event time to seek a subscription to. Seeks to the first message
          with event time greater than or equal to the specified event time. As
          event times are user supplied, subsequent messages may have event
          times less than the specified event time and should be filtered by
          the client, if necessary. Messages missing an event time use publish
          time as a fallback. Run $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
          time formats.

       --publish-time=PUBLISH_TIME
          The publish time to seek a subscription to. Messages with publish
          time greater than or equal to this time will be delivered post-seek.
          Run $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time formats.

       --starting-offset=STARTING_OFFSET
          The offset at which a newly created or seeked subscription will start
          receiving messages. A subscription can be initialized at the offset
          of the oldest retained message (beginning), or at the current HEAD
          offset (end). STARTING_OFFSET must be one of: beginning, end.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
