POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Topic resource - One or more topics to create. This represents a Cloud
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument topic on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       TOPIC [TOPIC ...]
          IDs of the topics or fully qualified identifiers for the topics. To
          set the topic attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument topic on the command line.

FLAGS
     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must

     --message-retention-duration=MESSAGE_RETENTION_DURATION
        Indicates the minimum duration to retain a message after it is

        subscribers. For instance, it allows any attached subscription to seek
        to a timestamp that is up to MESSAGE_RETENTION_DURATION in the past. If
        this field is not set, message retention is controlled by settings on
        individual subscriptions. The minimum is 10 minutes and the maximum is
        31 days. Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT
        is one of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days,
        respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed.
