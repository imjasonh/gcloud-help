NAME
    gcloud alpha pubsub subscriptions pull - pulls one or more Cloud Pub/Sub
        messages from a subscription

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha pubsub subscriptions pull SUBSCRIPTION [--auto-ack]
        [--max-messages=MAX_MESSAGES; default=1]
        [--return-immediately | --no-wait] [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Returns one or more messages from the specified Cloud Pub/Sub
    subscription, if there are any messages enqueued.

    By default, this command returns only one message from the subscription.
    Use the --limit flag to specify the max messages to return.

    Please note that this command is not guaranteed to return all the messages
    in your backlog or the maximum specified in the --limit argument. Receiving
    fewer messages than available occasionally is normal.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - Name of the subscription to pull messages from.
     This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument subscription on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          ID of the subscription or fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription.

          To set the subscription attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument subscription on the command line.

FLAGS
     --auto-ack
        Automatically ACK every message pulled from this subscription. Use
        --no-auto-ack to disable this flag.

     --max-messages=MAX_MESSAGES; default=1
        (DEPRECATED) The maximum number of messages that Cloud Pub/Sub can
        return in this response.

        --max-messages is deprecated. Please use --limit instead.

     Pull timeout behavior.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --return-immediately
          If this flag is set, the system responds immediately with any
          messages readily available in memory buffers. If no messages are
          available in the buffers, returns an empty list of messages as
          response, even if having messages in the backlog. Do not set this
          flag as it adversely impacts the performance of pull. Use
          --no-return-immediately to disable this flag.

       --wait
          (DEPRECATED) Wait (for a bounded amount of time) for new messages
          from the subscription, if there are none.

          --wait is deprecated. This flag is non-operational, as the wait
          behavior is now the default. Enabled by default, use --no-wait to
          disable.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull

        $ gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions pull
