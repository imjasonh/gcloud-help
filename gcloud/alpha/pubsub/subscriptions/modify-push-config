DESCRIPTION

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - Name of the subscription to modify. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument subscription on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          ID of the subscription or fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription.

          To set the subscription attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument subscription on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --push-endpoint=PUSH_ENDPOINT
        A URL to use as the endpoint for this subscription. This will also
        automatically set the subscription type to PUSH.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --push-auth-service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
        Service account email used as the identity for the generated Open ID
        Connect token for authenticated push.

     --push-auth-token-audience=OPTIONAL_AUDIENCE_OVERRIDE
        Audience used in the generated Open ID Connect token for authenticated
        push. If not specified, it will be set to the push-endpoint.

     NoWrapper Config Options.

     --push-no-wrapper
        When set, the message data is delivered directly as the HTTP body. Use
        --no-push-no-wrapper to disable this flag.

        This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
        this group are specified.

     --push-no-wrapper-write-metadata
        When true, writes the Pub/Sub message metadata to
        x-goog-pubsub-<KEY>:<VAL> headers of the HTTP request. Writes the
        Pub/Sub message attributes to <KEY>:<VAL> headers of the HTTP request.
        Use --no-push-no-wrapper-write-metadata to disable this flag.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud pubsub subscriptions modify-push-config

        $ gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions modify-push-config
