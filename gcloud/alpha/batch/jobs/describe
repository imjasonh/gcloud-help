NAME
    gcloud alpha batch jobs describe - show details of a job

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha batch jobs describe (JOB : --location=LOCATION)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The job specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access the given job.

EXAMPLES
    To print details of the job with name
    projects/foo/locations/us-central1/jobs/bar, run:

        $ gcloud alpha batch jobs describe \
            projects/foo/locations/us-central1/jobs/bar

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Job resource - The Batch job resource. The arguments in this group can be
     used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument JOB on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       JOB
          ID of the job or fully qualified identifier for the job. To set the
          job attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument JOB on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location for the job. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument JOB on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta batch jobs describe
