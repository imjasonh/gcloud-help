SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha batch resource-allowances describe
        (RESOURCE_ALLOWANCE : --location=LOCATION) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The resource allowance specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access the given
        resource allowance.

EXAMPLES
    To print details of the resource allowance with name
    projects/foo/locations/us-central1/resourceAllowances/bar, run:

        $ gcloud alpha batch resource-allowances describe \
            projects/foo/locations/us-central1/resourceAllowances/bar

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ResourceAllowance resource - The Batch resource allowance resource. If
     --location not specified,the current batch/location is used. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.
     (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
     set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument RESOURCE_ALLOWANCE on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       RESOURCE_ALLOWANCE

          resourceAllowance.

          To set the resource_allowance attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument RESOURCE_ALLOWANCE on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location for the resourceAllowance.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument RESOURCE_ALLOWANCE on the command line with

NOTES
