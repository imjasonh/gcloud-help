NAME
    gcloud alpha network-services service-lb-policies create - create a service
        LB policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha network-services service-lb-policies create
        (SERVICE_LB_POLICY : --location=LOCATION) [--async]
        [--auto-capacity-drain] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--failover-health-threshold=FAILOVER_HEALTH_THRESHOLD]
        [--load-balancing-algorithm=LOAD_BALANCING_ALGORITHM;
          default="waterfall-by-region"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a new service LB policy with the given name.

EXAMPLES
    Create a service LB policy with the name 'my-service-lb-policy', load
    balancing algorithm 'waterfall-by-region', and location 'global'.

        $ gcloud alpha network-services service-lb-policies create \
            my-service-lb-policy \
            --load-balancing-algorithm=waterfall-by-region \
            --location="global"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service lb policy resource - Name of the service LB policy to be created.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument service_lb_policy on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       SERVICE_LB_POLICY
          ID of the service lb policy or fully qualified identifier for the
          service lb policy.

          To set the service_lb_policy attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument service_lb_policy on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location Id.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument service_lb_policy on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --auto-capacity-drain
        If specified, an unhealthy MIG/NEG will be removed from Global load
        balancing and traffic routing for the service. A MIG/NEG is considered
        to be unhealthy if less than 25% of the instance/endpoints in the
        MIG/NEG are healthy. autoCapacityDrain will never drain more than 50%
        of the configured MIGs/NEGs of a Backend Service.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        The description for the service LB policy.

     --failover-health-threshold=FAILOVER_HEALTH_THRESHOLD
        The percentage threshold that a load balancer will begin to send
        traffic to failover backends. If the percentage of endpoints in a
        MIG/NEG is smaller than this value, traffic would be sent to failover
        backends if possible. This field should be set to a value between 1 and
        99. The default value is 50 for Global external HTTP(S) load balancer
        (classic) and Proxyless service mesh, and 70 for others.

     --load-balancing-algorithm=LOAD_BALANCING_ALGORITHM; default="waterfall-by-region"
        The global load balancing algorithm to be used.
        LOAD_BALANCING_ALGORITHM must be one of:

         spray-to-region
            Spread the traffic from each client to all the MIGs/NEGs in a
            region.

         spray-to-world
            Balance traffic across all backends across the world proportionally
            based on capacity.

         waterfall-by-region
            Direct traffic to the nearest region with endpoints and capacity
            before spilling over to other regions.

         waterfall-by-zone
            Attempt to keep traffic in a single zone closest to the client,
            before spilling over to other zones.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the networkservices/v1alpha1 API. The full documentation
    for this API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/networking

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:
