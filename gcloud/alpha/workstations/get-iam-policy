NAME
    gcloud alpha workstations get-iam-policy - get the IAM policy for a
        workstation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha workstations get-iam-policy
        (WORKSTATION : --cluster=CLUSTER --config=CONFIG --region=REGION)
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha workstations get-iam-policy displays the IAM policy
    associated with a given workstation. If formatted as JSON, the output can
    be edited and used as a policy file for set-iam-policy. The output includes
    an "etag" field identifying the version emitted and allowing detection of
    concurrent policy updates; see $ {parent} set-iam-policy for additional
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To get the IAM policy for a given workstation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha workstations get-iam-policy WORKSTATION

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Workstation resource - The workstation for which to display the IAM
     policy. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument workstation on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       WORKSTATION
          ID of the workstation or fully qualified identifier for the
          workstation.

          To set the workstation attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workstation on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --cluster=CLUSTER
          The name of the cluster containing the workstation.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workstation on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --cluster on the command line.

       --config=CONFIG
          The name of the config containing the workstation.

          To set the config attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workstation on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --config on the command line.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the region of the workstation.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workstation on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud workstations get-iam-policy

        $ gcloud beta workstations get-iam-policy
