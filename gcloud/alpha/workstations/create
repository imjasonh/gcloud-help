     --source-workstation=SOURCE_WORKSTATION
        Source workstation from which this workstations persistent directories
        are cloned on creation. When specified, the workstations service agent
        must have compute.disks.createSnapshot and
        compute.snapshots.useReadOnly permissions on the source workstation's
        host project.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the workstations/v1beta API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/workstations

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud workstations create

        $ gcloud beta workstations create
