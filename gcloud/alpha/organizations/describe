NAME
    gcloud alpha organizations describe - show metadata for an organization

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha organizations describe ORGANIZATION_ID [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Shows metadata for an organization, given a valid organization ID.
    If an organization domain is supplied instead, this command will attempt to
    find the organization by domain name.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The organization specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access the given
        organization.
      ▪ The domain name supplied does not correspond to a unique organization
        ID.

EXAMPLES
    The following command prints metadata for an organization with the ID
    3589215982:

        $ gcloud alpha organizations describe 3589215982

    The following command prints metadata for an organization associated with
    the domain example.com:

        $ gcloud alpha organizations describe example.com

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ORGANIZATION_ID
        ID or domain for the organization you want to describe.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud organizations describe

        $ gcloud beta organizations describe
