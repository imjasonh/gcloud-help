DESCRIPTION

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          Folder number. Only one of --project, --folder, or --organization can
          be provided. If none are provided then it uses config property
          [core/project].

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          Organization number. Either --project, --folder, or --organization
          must be provided. If none are provided then it uses config property
          [core/project].

       --project=PROJECT
          Project number or id. Only one of --project, --folder, or
          --organization can be provided. If none are provided then it uses
          config property [core/project].

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud access-approval settings delete

        $ gcloud beta access-approval settings delete
