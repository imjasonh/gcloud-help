NAME
    gcloud alpha access-approval requests dismiss - dismiss an Access Approval
        request

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha access-approval requests dismiss NAME [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Dismiss an Access Approval request. Note: this does not deny access
    to the resource if another request has been made and approved for the same
    resource. This will raise an error if the request does not exist.

EXAMPLES
    To dismiss an approval request using its name (e.g.
    projects/12345/approvalRequests/abc123), run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-approval requests dismiss \
            projects/12345/approvalRequests/abc123

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the Access Approval request to invalidate

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud access-approval requests dismiss

        $ gcloud beta access-approval requests dismiss
