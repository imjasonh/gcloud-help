SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The gcloud netapp command group lets you create, configure and

    etc.

    scale, performance and value to manage and run on-prem NetApp Files
    solutions on Google infrastructure, so you don't have to modernize your
    file workloads, and allow for legacy feature support.
