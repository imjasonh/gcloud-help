NAME
    gcloud alpha iam roles undelete - undelete a custom role from an
        organization or a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iam roles undelete ROLE_ID
        (--organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT_ID)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command undeletes a role. Roles that have been deleted for
    certain long time can't be undeleted.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The role specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active user does not have permission to access the given role.

EXAMPLES
    To undelete the role ProjectUpdater of the organization 1234567, run:

        $ gcloud alpha iam roles undelete roles/ProjectUpdater \
            --organization=1234567

    To undelete the role ProjectUpdater of the project myproject, run:

        $ gcloud alpha iam roles undelete roles/ProjectUpdater \
            --project=myproject

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ROLE_ID
        The id of the custom role to undelete. For example: CustomRole. You
        must also specify the --organization or --project flag.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization of the role you want to undelete.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The project of the role you want to undelete.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud iam roles undelete

        $ gcloud beta iam roles undelete
