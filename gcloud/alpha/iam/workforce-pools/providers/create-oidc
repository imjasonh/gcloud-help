POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Workforce pool provider resource - The workforce pool provider to create.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource.

     This must be specified.

       PROVIDER
          ID of the workforce pool provider or fully qualified identifier for
          the workforce pool provider. To set the provider attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument provider on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location for the workforce pool. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument provider on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

       --workforce-pool=WORKFORCE_POOL
          The ID to use for the workforce pool, which becomes the final
          component of the resource name. This value must be a globally unique
          string of 6 to 63 lowercase letters, digits, or hyphens. It must
          start with a letter, and cannot have a trailing hyphen. The prefix
          gcp- is reserved for use by Google, and may not be specified.

          To set the workforce-pool attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument provider on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --workforce-pool on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --attribute-mapping=[ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING,...]
        Maps claims from the authentication credentials issued by the Identity
        Provider into Google Cloud IAM attributes, e.g. subject, segment.

        Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to
        be produced.

        The following predefined keys are currently supported:

        ◆ google.subject: required field that indicates the principal that is
          being authenticated to IAM, and will be logged in all API accesses
          for which Cloud Audit Logging is configured.

        ◆ google.groups: optional field that indicates asserted groups that
          the user should be considered to belong to. You can create IAM
          bindings using the groups attribute and access to a resource will be
          granted if any of the groups asserted here match a group in the
          respective binding.

        ◆ google.display_name: optional field that overrides the name of the
          user. If not set, google.subject will be displayed instead. This
          attribute cannot be used in IAM policies. The maximum length of this
          field is 100 characters.

        ◆ google.profile_photo: optional fields that may be set to a valid
          URL specifying the user's thumbnail photo. When set, the image will
          be visible as the user's profile picture. If not set, a generic user
          icon will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be used in IAM
          policies.

        Custom attributes can also be mapped by specifying
        attribute.{custom_attribute}, replacing {custom_attribute} with the
        name of the custom attribute to be mapped. A maximum of 50 custom
        attribute mappings can be defined. The maximum length of a mapped
        attribute key is 2048 characters and may only contain the characters
        [a-z0-9].

        These attributes can then be referenced in IAM policies to define
        fine-grained access for the workforce pool to Google Cloud resources by
        specifying:

        ◆ google.subject:
          principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/subject/{value}

        ◆ google.groups:
          principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/group/{value}

        ◆ attribute.{custom_attribute}:
          principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}

        Each value must be a Common Expression Language
        (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function that maps an Identity
        Provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the
        corresponding map key.

        The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions:

        ◆ assertion: JSON representing the authentication credential issued
          by the Identity Provider.

        The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048
        characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes
        must not exceed 8KB.

        Example: Map the sub claim of the incoming credential to the subject
        Google Cloud IAM attribute.

            {"google.subject": "assertion.sub"}

     --client-id=CLIENT_ID
        The OIDC client ID. This must match the audience claim of the JWT
        issued by the identity provider.

     --issuer-uri=ISSUER_URI
        The OIDC issuer URI. Must be a valid URI using the 'https' scheme.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --attribute-condition=ATTRIBUTE_CONDITION
        A Common Expression Language (https://opensource.google/projects/cel)
        expression, in plain text, to restrict which otherwise valid
        authentication credentials issued by the provider should be accepted.

        The expression must output a boolean representing whether to allow the
        federation.

        The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions:

        ◆ assertion: JSON representing the authentication credential issued
          by the Provider.
        ◆ google: The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the
          attribute_mappings. google.profile_photo and google.display_name are
          not supported.
        ◆ attribute: The custom attributes mapped from the assertion in the
          attribute_mappings.

        The maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096
        characters. If unspecified, all valid authentication credential will be
        accepted.

        Example: Only allow credentials with a mapped google.groups value of
        admins.

            "'admins' in google.groups"

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A description for the workforce pool provider. Cannot exceed 256
        characters in length.

     --disabled
        Whether the workforce pool provider is disabled. You cannot use a
        disabled provider to perform new token exchanges or sign-ins. However,
        existing tokens still grant access.

     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
        A display name for the workforce pool provider. Cannot exceed 32
        characters in length.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the iam/v1 API. The full documentation for this API can
    be found at: https://cloud.google.com/iam/

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud iam workforce-pools providers create-oidc

        $ gcloud beta iam workforce-pools providers create-oidc
