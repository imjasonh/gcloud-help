NAME
    gcloud alpha iam service-accounts delete - delete a service account from a
        project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iam service-accounts delete SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) If the service account does not exist, this command returns a
    PERMISSION_DENIED error.

EXAMPLES
    To delete an service account from your project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha iam service-accounts delete \
            my-iam-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        The service account to delete. The account should be formatted either
        as a numeric service account ID or as an email, like this:
        123456789876543212345 or my-iam-account@somedomain.com.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud iam service-accounts delete

        $ gcloud beta iam service-accounts delete
