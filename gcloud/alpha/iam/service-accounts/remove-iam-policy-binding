NAME
    gcloud alpha iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding - remove IAM
        policy binding from a service account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        --member=PRINCIPAL --role=ROLE
        [--all | --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Remove an IAM policy binding from the IAM policy of a service
    account. A binding consists of at least one member, a role, and an optional
    condition.

    When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a
    resource or as an identity. This command is to remove a policy binding from
    a service account resource. There are other gcloud commands to manage IAM
    policies for other types of resources. For example, to manage IAM policies
    on a project, use the $ gcloud projects commands.

    If the service account does not exist, this command returns a
    PERMISSION_DENIED error.

EXAMPLES
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/editor' for the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' on a service account with identifier
    'my-iam-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com', run:

        $ gcloud alpha iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my-iam-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/editor'

    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/editor' from all
    authenticated users on service account
    'my-iam-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com', run:

        $ gcloud alpha iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my-iam-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
            --member='allAuthenticatedUsers' --role='roles/editor'

    To remove an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018
    for the role of 'roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin' and the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' on a service account with identifier
    'my-iam-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com', run:

        $ gcloud alpha iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my-iam-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ServiceAccount resource - The service account to remove the IAM policy
     binding from. Note that the user, group or service account in the --member
     flag is having its access revoked. This represents a Cloud resource.
     (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
     set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument service_account on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          ID of the serviceAccount or fully qualified identifier for the
          serviceAccount.

          To set the service_account attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument service_account on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Deleted principals have an additional deleted: prefix and a ?uid=UID
        suffix, where UID is a unique identifier for the principal. Example:
        deleted:user:test-user@gmail.com?uid=123456789012345678901.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the principal from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and principal, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding that you want to remove. When the
          condition is explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a
          binding without a condition is removed. Otherwise, only a binding
          with a condition that exactly matches the specified condition
          (including the optional description) is removed. For more on
          conditions, refer to the conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition. Use a full or
          relative path to a local file containing the value of condition.
