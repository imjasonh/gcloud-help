        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a Filestore backup.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The backup specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to delete the given
        backup.

EXAMPLES
    The following command deletes a backup with the name 'my-backup' in the
    region us-central1:

        $ gcloud alpha filestore backups delete my-backup \
            --region=us-central1

        delete.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the backup.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
