         name
            The desired logical name of the volume.

         nfs-export-options
            The NfsExportOptions for the Cloud Filestore instance file share.
            Configuring NfsExportOptions is optional and can only be set using
            flags-file. Use the --flags-file flag to specify the path to a JSON
            or YAML configuration file that contains the required
            NfsExportOptions flags.

         ip-ranges
            A list of IPv4 addresses or CIDR ranges that are allowed to mount
            the file share. IPv4 addresses format: {octet 1}.{octet 2}.{octet
            3}.{octet 4}. CIDR range format: {octet 1}.{octet 2}.{octet
            3}.{octet 4}/{mask size}. Overlapping IP ranges are allowed for all
            tiers other than BASIC_HDD and BASIC_SSD. The limit of IP
            ranges/addresses for each FileShareConfig among all
            NfsExportOptions is 64 per instance.

         access-mode
            The type of access allowed for the specified IP-addresses or CIDR
            ranges. READ_ONLY: Allows only read requests on the exported file
            share. READ_WRITE: Allows both read and write requests on the
            exported file share. The default setting is READ_WRITE.

         squash-mode
            Enables or disables root squash for the specified IP addresses or
            CIDR ranges. NO_ROOT_SQUASH: Disables root squash to allow root
            access on the exported file share. ROOT_SQUASH. Enables root squash
            to remove root access on the exported file share. The default
            setting is NO_ROOT_SQUASH.

         anon_uid
            An integer that represents the user ID of anonymous users. Anon_uid
            may only be set when squash_mode is set to ROOT_SQUASH. If
            NO_ROOT_SQUASH is specified, an error will be returned. The default
            value is 65534.

         anon_gid
            An integer that represents the group ID of anonymous groups.
            Anon_gid may only be set when squash_mode is set to ROOT_SQUASH. If
            NO_ROOT_SQUASH is specified, an error will be returned. The default
            value is 65534.

         security-flavors
            A list of security flavors that are allowed to be used during mount
            command in NFSv4.1 filestore instances. The security flavors
            supported are:
              ▫ SECURITY_FLAVOR_UNSPECIFIED: SecurityFlavor not set. Defaults
                to AUTH_SYS.
              ▫ AUTH_SYS: The user's UNIX user-id and group-ids are passed in
                the clear.
              ▫ KRB5: The end-user authentication is done using Kerberos V5.
              ▫ KRB5I: KRB5 plus integrity protection (data packets are
                tamper proof).
              ▫ KRB5P: KRB5I plus privacy protection (data packets are tamper
                proof and encrypted).

         source-snapshot
            The name of the snapshot to restore from. Supported for BASIC
            instances only.

         source-snapshot-region
            The region of the source snapshot. If unspecified, it is assumed
            that the Filestore snapshot is local and instance-zone will be
            used.

         source-backup
            The name of the backup to restore from.

         source-backup-region
            The region of the source backup.

     --network=[connect-mode=CONNECT-MODE],[name=NAME],[reserved-ip-range=RESERVED-IP-RANGE]
        Network configuration for a Cloud Filestore instance. Specifying
        reserved-ip-range and connect-mode is optional.
         name
            The name of the Google Compute Engine VPC network to which the
            instance is connected.
         reserved-ip-range
            The reserved-ip-range can have one of the following two types of
            values: a CIDR range value when using DIRECT_PEERING connect mode
            or an allocated IP address range
            (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-internal-ip-address)
            when using PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS connect mode. When the name of an
            allocated IP address range is specified, it must be one of the
            ranges associated with the private service access connection. When
            specified as a direct CIDR value, it must be a /29 CIDR block for
            Basic tier or a /24 CIDR block for High Scale, Zonal, Enterprise or
            Regional tier in one of the internal IP address ranges
            (https://www.arin.net/knowledge/address_filters.html) that
            identifies the range of IP addresses reserved for this instance.
            For example, 10.0.0.0/29 or 192.168.0.0/24. The range you specify
            can't overlap with either existing subnets or assigned IP address
            ranges for other Cloud Filestore instances in the selected VPC
            network.
         connect-mode
            Network connection mode used by instances. CONNECT_MODE must be one
            of: DIRECT_PEERING or PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS.

OPTIONAL FLAGS

        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.
