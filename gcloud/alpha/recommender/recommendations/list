            --recommender=google.compute.instance.MachineTypeRecommender

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        Location

     Resource that is associated with cloud entity type. Currently four
     mutually exclusive flags are supported, --project, --billing-account,
     --folder, --organization.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT
          The Google Cloud Platform billing account ID to use for this
          invocation.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform folder ID to use for this invocation.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform organization ID to use for this invocation.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform project ID. Overrides the default
          core/project property value for this command invocation.

FLAGS
     --recommender=RECOMMENDER
        Recommender to list recommendations for. If no recommender is
        specified, recommendations for all supported recommenders is listed.
        Supported recommenders can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/recommenders

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud recommender recommendations list

        $ gcloud beta recommender recommendations list
