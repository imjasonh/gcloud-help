NAME
    gcloud alpha recommender - manage Cloud recommendations and recommendation
        rules

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha recommender GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Recommender allows you to retrieve recommendations for Cloud
    resources, helping you to improve security, save costs, and more. Each
    recommendation includes a suggested action, its justification, and its
    impact. Recommendations are grouped into a per-resource collection. To
    apply a recommendation, you must use the desired service's API, not the
    Recommender. Interact with and manage resources in Cloud Recommender.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

GROUPS
    GROUP is one of the following:

     insights
        (ALPHA) Manage Cloud resource insights.

     recommendations
        (ALPHA) Manage Cloud resource recommendations.

     recommender-configs
        (ALPHA) Manage Cloud resource recommender configs.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud recommender

        $ gcloud beta recommender
