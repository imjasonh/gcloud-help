NAME
    gcloud alpha network-connectivity internal-ranges create - create a new
        internal range

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha network-connectivity internal-ranges create
        (INTERNAL_RANGE : --region=REGION) --network=NETWORK
        (--ip-cidr-range=IP_CIDR_RANGE | [--prefix-length=PREFIX_LENGTH
          : --target-cidr-range=[TARGET_CIDR_RANGE,...]]) [--async]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--labels=KEY=VALUE]
        [--overlaps=[OVERLAPS,...]] [--peering=PEERING; default="for-self"]
        [--usage=USAGE; default="for-vpc"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a new internal range with the given name.

EXAMPLES
    Create an internal range with name my-range and ip-cidr-range
    192.168.0.0/25 in network
    https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/locations/global/networks/my-network:

        $ gcloud alpha network-connectivity internal-ranges create \
            my-range --ip-cidr-range="192.168.0.0/25" \
            --network="https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-pro\
        ject/locations/global/networks/my-network" --project=my-project

    Create an internal range with name my-range and auto-allocated /25 block
    (prefix-length 25) in network my-network:

        $ gcloud alpha network-connectivity internal-ranges create \
            my-range --prefix-length=25 --network="my-network" \
            --project=my-project

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Internal range resource - Name of the internal range to be created. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument internal_range on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       INTERNAL_RANGE
          ID of the internal range or fully qualified identifier for the
          internal range. To set the internal_range attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument internal_range on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The location ID.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument internal_range on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ use default global location .

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The URL or resource ID of the network in which to reserve the internal
        range. Legacy network is not supported. This can only be specified for
        a global internal address.

        For example:
        ◆ https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/locations/global/networks/my-network
        ◆ /projects/my-project/locations/global/networks/my-network
        ◆ my-network

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --ip-cidr-range=IP_CIDR_RANGE
          IP range that this internal range defines.

       --prefix-length=PREFIX_LENGTH
          An alternative to ip-cidr-range. Can be set when trying to create a
          reservation that automatically finds a free range of the given size.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --target-cidr-range=[TARGET_CIDR_RANGE,...]
          Can be set to narrow down or pick a different address space while
          searching for a free range. If not set, defaults to the "10.0.0.0/8"
          address space. This can be used to search in other rfc-1918 address
          spaces like "172.16.0.0/12" and "192.168.0.0/16" or non-rfc-1918
          address spaces used in the VPC.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the internal range to be created.

     --labels=KEY=VALUE
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

     --overlaps=[OVERLAPS,...]
        Overlap specifications for the range being created. OVERLAPS must be
        (only one value is supported):

         overlap-route-range
            Allows for creation or existence of routes that have a more
            specific destination than the created range.

     --peering=PEERING; default="for-self"
        The type of peering set for the internal range. PEERING must be one of:

         for-peer
            This behavior can be set when the internal range is being reserved
            for usage by the peers. This means that no resource within the VPC
            in which it is being created can use this to associate with a cloud
            resource, but one of the peers can. This represents "donating" a
            range for peers to use.

         for-self
            This beharior represents the case that the internal range is
            intended to be used in the VPC on which it is created and is
            accessible from its peers. This implies that peers or peer-of-peers
            cannot use this range.

         not-shared
            This behavior can be set when the internal range is being reserved
            for usage by the VPC on which it is created but not shared with the
            peers. In a sense it is local to the VPC. This can be used to
            create internal ranges for various purposes like
            HTTP_INTERNAL_LOAD_BALANCER or for interconnect routes that are not
            shared with peers. This also implies that peers cannot use this
            range in a way that is visible to this VPC, but can re-use this
            range as long as it is NOT_SHARED from the peer VPC too.

     --usage=USAGE; default="for-vpc"
        The type of usage set for the internal range. USAGE must be one of:

         external-to-vpc
            Ranges created with EXTERNAL_TO_VPC cannot be associated with cloud
            resources and are meant to block out address ranges for various use
            cases, like for example, usage on-prem, with dynamic route
            announcements via interconnect.

         for-vpc
            A cloud resource can use the reserved CIDR block by associating it
            with the internal range resource if usage is set to FOR_VPC.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the networkconnectivity/v1alpha1 API. The full
    documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/reference/networkconnectivity/rest

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud network-connectivity internal-ranges create
