NAME
    gcloud alpha network-connectivity internal-ranges update - update an
        internal range

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha network-connectivity internal-ranges update
        (INTERNAL_RANGE : --region=REGION) [--async]
        [--clear-labels | --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--clear-overlaps | --overlaps=[OVERLAPS,...]]
        [--ip-cidr-range=IP_CIDR_RANGE | --prefix-length=PREFIX_LENGTH]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update the details of an internal range.

EXAMPLES
    Update ip-cidr-range of an internal range named my-range:

        $ gcloud alpha network-connectivity internal-ranges update \
            my-range --ip-cidr-range="192.168.0.0/24"

    Extend an internal range named my-range to an address block of /24:

        $ gcloud alpha network-connectivity internal-ranges update \
            my-range --prefix-length=24

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Internal range resource - Name of the internal range to be created. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument internal_range on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       INTERNAL_RANGE
          ID of the internal range or fully qualified identifier for the
          internal range.

          To set the internal_range attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument internal_range on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The location ID.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument internal_range on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ use default global location .

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Clear existing labels for the range.

       --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          List of label KEY=VALUE pairs for the range being updated.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-overlaps
          Clear existing overlap fields for the range.

       --overlaps=[OVERLAPS,...]
          Overlap specifications for the range being updated. OVERLAPS must be
          one of:

           overlap-existing-subnet-range
              Allows for creation of internal ranges that overlap with existing
              subnets.

           overlap-route-range
              Allows for creation or existence of routes that have a more
              specific destination than the created range.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --ip-cidr-range=IP_CIDR_RANGE
          IP range that this internal range defines.

       --prefix-length=PREFIX_LENGTH
          An alternative to ip-cidr-range. Can be set when trying to create a
          reservation that automatically finds a free range of the given size.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the networkconnectivity/v1alpha1 API. The full
    documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/reference/networkconnectivity/rest

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud network-connectivity internal-ranges update
