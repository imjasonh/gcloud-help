REQUIRED FLAGS
     Location resource - The project/organization/folder location for which the
     settings needs to be exported. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project. This resource can be one of the
        following types: [privilegedaccessmanager.projects.locations,
        privilegedaccessmanager.folders.locations,
        privilegedaccessmanager.organizations.locations].

     This must be specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location or fully qualified identifier for the location.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --folder=FOLDER
          The name of the folder

          To set the folder attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --folder on the command line. Must be
            specified for resource of type
            [privilegedaccessmanager.folders.locations].

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The name of the organization

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --organization on the command line. Must be
            specified for resource of type
            [privilegedaccessmanager.organizations.locations].

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --destination=DESTINATION
        Path to a YAML file where the configuration will be exported. The
        exported data will not contain any output-only fields. Alternatively,
        you may omit this flag to write to standard output. For a schema
        describing the export/import format, see
        $CLOUDSDKROOT/lib/googlecloudsdk/schemas/...

    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the privilegedaccessmanager/v1alpha API. The full
    documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-overview

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:
