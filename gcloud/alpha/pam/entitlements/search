        $ gcloud alpha pam entitlements search --project=sample-project \
            --location=global --caller-access-type=grant-requester

    The following command searches for and lists all entitlements for which you

        $ gcloud alpha pam entitlements search --folder=FOLDER_ID \
            --location=global --caller-access-type=grant-requester

    The following command searches for and lists all entitlements for which you
    are an approver, in a folder with ID FOLDER_ID, and in location global:

        $ gcloud alpha pam entitlements search --folder=FOLDER_ID \
            --location=global --caller-access-type=grant-approver

    The following command searches for and lists all entitlements for which you
    are a requester, in an organization with ID ORGANIZATION_ID, and in

            --caller-access-type=grant-approver

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --caller-access-type=CALLER_ACCESS_TYPE
        Search for entitlements based on whether you are a requester or
        approver. CALLER_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of: grant-approver,
        grant-requester.

     Location resource - Location of the entitlements. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project. This resource can be one of the
        following types: [privilegedaccessmanager.projects.locations,
        privilegedaccessmanager.folders.locations,
        privilegedaccessmanager.organizations.locations].

     This must be specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location or fully qualified identifier for the location.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --folder=FOLDER
          The name of the folder

          To set the folder attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --folder on the command line. Must be
            specified for resource of type
            [privilegedaccessmanager.folders.locations].

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The name of the organization

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --organization on the command line. Must be
            specified for resource of type
            [privilegedaccessmanager.organizations.locations].

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the privilegedaccessmanager/v1alpha API. The full
    documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-overview

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud pam entitlements search

        $ gcloud beta pam entitlements search
