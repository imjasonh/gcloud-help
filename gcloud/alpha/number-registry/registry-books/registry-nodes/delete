POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RegistryNode resource - Name of the resource The arguments in this group
     can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument registry_node on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       REGISTRY_NODE
          ID of the registryNode or fully qualified identifier for the
          registryNode.

          To set the registry_node attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument registry_node on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          locations TBD

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument registry_node on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

       --registry-book=REGISTRY_BOOK
          registryBooks TBD

          To set the registry-book attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument registry_node on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --registry-book on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --request-id=REQUEST_ID
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request
        ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
        ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
        guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
        the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
        request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
        request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.
        This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID
        is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
