NAME
    gcloud alpha run jobs execute - execute a job

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha run jobs execute [JOB] [--region=REGION] [--async | --wait]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Execute a job.

EXAMPLES
    To execute a job:

        $ gcloud alpha run jobs execute my-job

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Job resource - Job to execute. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument JOB on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ specify the job name from an interactive prompt with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       [JOB]
          ID of the Job or fully qualified identifier for the Job. To set the
          jobs attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument JOB on the command line;
          ▸ specify the job name from an interactive prompt.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region in which the resource can be found. Alternatively, set the
        property [run/region].

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --async
          Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
          complete.

       --wait
          Wait until the execution has completed running before exiting. If not
          set, gcloud exits successfully when the execution has started.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
