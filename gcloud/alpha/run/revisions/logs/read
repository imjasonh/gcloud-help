SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha run revisions logs read REVISION
        [--freshness=FRESHNESS; default="1d"] [--log-filter=LOG_FILTER]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha run revisions logs read reads log entries. Log entries
    matching --log-filter are returned in order of decreasing timestamps,
    most-recent entries first. If the log entries come from multiple logs, then
    entries from different logs might be intermingled in the results.

EXAMPLES
    To read log entries from for a Cloud Run revision, run:

        $ gcloud alpha run revisions logs read my-revision

    To read log entries with severity ERROR or higher, run:

        $ gcloud alpha run revisions logs read my-revision \
            --log-filter="severity>=ERROR"

    To read log entries written in a specific time window, run:

        $ gcloud alpha run revisions logs read my-revision \
            --log-filter='timestamp<="2015-05-31T23:59:59Z" AND
         timestamp>="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z"'

    To read up to 10 log entries in your revision payloads that include the
    word SearchText and format the output in JSON format, run:

        $ gcloud alpha run revisions logs read my-revision \
            --log-filter="textPayload:SearchText" --limit=10 --format=json
