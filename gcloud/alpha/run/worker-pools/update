DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update Cloud Run environment variables and other configuration
    settings.

EXAMPLES
    To update one or more env vars:

        $ gcloud alpha run worker-pools update myworkerpool \
          --update-env-vars=KEY1=VALUE1,KEY2=VALUE2

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     WorkerPool resource - WorkerPool to update the configuration of. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument WORKER_POOL on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ specify the workerpool name from an interactive prompt with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       [WORKER_POOL]
          ID of the WorkerPool or fully qualified identifier for the
          WorkerPool.

          To set the worker-pool attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument WORKER_POOL on the command line;
          ▸ specify the workerpool name from an interactive prompt.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud region for the WorkerPool. Overrides the default run/region
          property value for this command invocation.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument WORKER_POOL on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ specify the workerpool name from an interactive prompt with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property run/region;
          ▸ specify the region from an interactive prompt.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --breakglass=JUSTIFICATION
        Justification to bypass Binary Authorization policy constraints and
        allow the operation. See
        https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization/docs/using-breakglass for
        more information. Next update or deploy command will automatically
        clear existing breakglass justification.

     --container=CONTAINER
        Specifies a container by name. Flags following --container will apply
        to the specified container.

        Flags that are not container-specific must be specified before
        --container.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Provides an optional, human-readable description of the service.

     --gpu-type=GPU_TYPE
        The GPU type to use.

     --[no-]gpu-zonal-redundancy
        Set GPU zonal redundancy. Use --gpu-zonal-redundancy to enable and
        --no-gpu-zonal-redundancy to disable.

     --max=MAX
        The maximum number of container instances to run for this WorkerPool or
        'default' to use system default of 100. This instance limit will be
        divided among all Revisions receiving a percentage of instance
        assignments and can be modified without deploying a new Revision.

     --min=MIN
        The minimum number of container instances to run for this WorkerPool or
        'default' to use system default of 1. These instances will be divided
        among all Revisions receiving a percentage of instance assignments and
        can be modified without deploying a new Revision.

     --no-promote
        True to avoid assign instances to the worker revision being deployed.
        Setting this flag assigns any instances assigned to the LATEST revision
        to the specific revision bound to LATEST before the deployment. The
        effect is that the revision being deployed will not receive instance
        split.

        After a deployment with this flag the LATEST revision will not receive
        instances on future deployments. To restore assinging instances to the
        LATEST revision by default, run the gcloud run workers
        update-instance-split command with --to-latest.

     --remove-containers=[CONTAINER,...]
        List of containers to remove.

     --revision-suffix=REVISION_SUFFIX
        Specify the suffix of the revision name. Revision names always start
        with the service name automatically. For example, specifying
        [--revision-suffix=v1] for a service named 'helloworld', would lead to
        a revision named 'helloworld-v1'. Set empty string to clear the suffix
        and resume server-assigned naming.

     --scaling=SCALING
        The scaling mode to use for this resource. Flag value could be either
        "auto" for automatic scaling, or a positive integer to configure manual
        scaling with the given integer as a fixed instance count.

     --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        the email address of an IAM service account associated with the
        revision of the service. The service account represents the identity of
        the running revision, and determines what permissions the revision has.

     --vpc-egress=VPC_EGRESS
        Specify which of the outbound traffic to send through Direct VPC egress
        or the VPC connector for this resource. This resource must have Direct
        VPC egress enabled or a VPC connector to set this flag. VPC_EGRESS must
        be one of:

         all
            (DEPRECATED) Sends all outbound traffic through Direct VPC egress
            or the VPC connector. Provides the same functionality as
            'all-traffic'. Prefer to use 'all-traffic' instead.
         all-traffic
            Sends all outbound traffic through Direct VPC egress or the VPC
            connector.
         private-ranges-only
            Default option. Sends outbound traffic to private IP addresses (RFC
            1918 and Private Google Access IPs) through Direct VPC egress or
            the VPC connector.

            Traffic to other Cloud Run services might require additional
            configuration. See
            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/private-networking#send_requests_to_other_services_and_services
            for more information.

     These flags modify the Cloud SQL instances this WorkerPool connects to.
     You can specify a name of a Cloud SQL instance if it's in the same project
     and region as your Cloud Run worker pool; otherwise specify
     <project>:<region>:<instance> for the instance.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --add-cloudsql-instances=[CLOUDSQL-INSTANCES,...]
          Append the given values to the current Cloud SQL instances.

       --clear-cloudsql-instances
          Empty the current Cloud SQL instances.

       --remove-cloudsql-instances=[CLOUDSQL-INSTANCES,...]
          Remove the given values from the current Cloud SQL instances.

       --set-cloudsql-instances=[CLOUDSQL-INSTANCES,...]
          Completely replace the current Cloud SQL instances with the given
          values.

     --add-volume=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a volume to the Cloud Run resource. To add more than one volume,
        specify this flag multiple times. Volumes must have a type key. Volumes
        must have a name key if mount-path is not specified. A name key is
        optional if mount-path is specified.Only certain values are supported
        for type. Depending on the provided type, other keys will be required.
        The following types are supported with the specified additional keys:

        cloud-storage: A volume representing a Cloud Storage bucket. This
        volume type is mounted using Cloud Storage FUSE. See
        https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcs-fuse for the details and
        limitations of this filesystem. Additional keys:
        ◆ readonly: (optional) A boolean. If true, this volume will be
          read-only from all mounts.
        ◆ mount-options: (optional) A list of flags to pass to GCSFuse. Flags
          should be specified without leading dashes and separated by
          semicolons.
        ◆ bucket: (optional) the name of the bucket to use as the source of
          this volume.
        ◆ dynamic-mounting: (optional) A boolean. If true, the volume will be
          mounted dynamically. Note: You will either need to specify a bucket
          or set dynamic-mounting to true, but not both.
        ◆ mount-path: (optional) The path at which the volume should be
          mounted. The mount-path parameter is only supported for single
          container services which do not make use of the --container flag. For
          multi-container services, specify the mount-path parameter under the
          --add-volume-mount flag.

        cloudsql: Represents a Cloud SQL instance as a volume. Additional keys:
        ◆ instances: (required) The name of the Cloud SQL instances to mount.
          Must be in the form project_id:region:instance_id and separated by
          semicolons.
        ◆ mount-path: (optional) The path at which the volume should be
          mounted. The mount-path parameter is only supported for single
          container services which do not make use of the --container flag. For
          multi-container services, specify the mount-path parameter under the
          --add-volume-mount flag.

        ephemeral-disk: A volume that stores data on a temporary disk. With
        this type of volume, data is not shared between instances and all data
        will be lost when the instance it is on is terminated. Additional keys:
        ◆ mount-path: (optional) The path at which the volume should be
          mounted. The mount-path parameter is only supported for single
          container services which do not make use of the --container flag. For
          multi-container services, specify the mount-path parameter under the
          --add-volume-mount flag.
        ◆ size: (optional) A quantity representing the amount of disk space
          allocated to this volume, such as "512Mi" or "3G".

        in-memory: An ephemeral volume that stores data in the instance's
        memory. With this type of volume, data is not shared between instances
        and all data will be lost when the instance it is on is terminated.
        Additional keys:
        ◆ mount-path: (optional) The path at which the volume should be
          mounted. The mount-path parameter is only supported for single

          --add-volume-mount flag.
        ◆ size-limit: (optional) A quantity representing the maximum amount
          of memory allocated to this volume, such as "512Mi" or "3G". Data
          stored in an in-memory volume consumes the memory allocation of the
          container that wrote the data. If size-limit is not specified, the
          maximum size will be half the total memory limit of all containers.

        nfs: Represents a volume backed by an NFS server. Additional keys:
        ◆ location: (required) The location of the NFS Server, in the form
          SERVER:/PATH
        ◆ mount-path: (optional) The path at which the volume should be
          mounted. The mount-path parameter is only supported for single
          container services which do not make use of the --container flag. For
          multi-container services, specify the mount-path parameter under the
          --add-volume-mount flag.
        ◆ readonly: (optional) A boolean. If true, this volume will be
          read-only from all mounts.

        secret: Represents a secret stored in Secret Manager as a volume.
        Additional keys:
        ◆ secret: (required) The name of the secret in Secret Manager. Must
          be a secret in the same project being deployed or be an alias mapped
          in the run.googleapis.com/secrets annotation.
        ◆ version: (required) The version of the secret to make available in
          the volume.
        ◆ path: (required) The relative path within the volume to mount that
          version.
        ◆ mount-path: (optional) The path at which the volume should be
          mounted. The mount-path parameter is only supported for single
          container services which do not make use of the --container flag. For
          multi-container services, specify the mount-path parameter under the
          --add-volume-mount flag.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct

    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta run worker-pools update
