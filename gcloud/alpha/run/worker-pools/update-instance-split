NAME
    gcloud alpha run worker-pools update-instance-split - adjust the instance
        assignments for a Cloud Run worker-pool

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha run worker-pools update-instance-split
        [[WORKER_POOL] --region=REGION] [--async] [--breakglass=JUSTIFICATION]
        [--to-latest | --to-revisions=[REVISION-NAME=PERCENTAGE,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Adjust the instance assignments for a Cloud Run worker-pool.

EXAMPLES
    To assign 10% of instances to revision my-worker-pool-s5sxn and 90% of
    instances to revision my-worker-pool-cp9kw run:

        $ gcloud alpha run worker-pools update-instance-split \
          my-worker-pool \
          --to-revisions=my-worker-pool-s5sxn=10,my-worker-pool-cp9kw=90

    To increase the instances to revision my-worker-pool-s5sxn to 20% and by
    reducing the instances to revision my-worker-pool-cp9kw to 80% run:

        $ gcloud alpha run worker-pools update-instance-split \
          my-worker-pool --to-revisions=my-worker-pool-s5sxn=20

    To rollback to revision my-worker-pool-cp9kw run:

        $ gcloud alpha run worker-pools update-instance-split \
          my-worker-pool --to-revisions=my-worker-pool-cp9kw=100

    To assign 100% of instances to the current or future LATEST revision run:

        $ gcloud alpha run worker-pools update-instance-split \
          my-worker-pool --to-latest

    You can also refer to the current or future LATEST revision in
    --to-revisions by the string "LATEST". For example, to set 10% of instances
    to always float to the latest revision:

        $ gcloud alpha run worker-pools update-instance-split \
          my-worker-pool --to-revisions=LATEST=10

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     WorkerPool resource - WorkerPool to update instance split of. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument WORKER_POOL on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ specify the workerpool name from an interactive prompt with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       [WORKER_POOL]
          ID of the WorkerPool or fully qualified identifier for the
          WorkerPool.

          To set the worker-pool attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument WORKER_POOL on the command line;
          ▸ specify the workerpool name from an interactive prompt.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud region for the WorkerPool. Overrides the default run/region
          property value for this command invocation.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument WORKER_POOL on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ specify the workerpool name from an interactive prompt with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property run/region;
          ▸ specify the region from an interactive prompt.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --breakglass=JUSTIFICATION
        Justification to bypass Binary Authorization policy constraints and
        allow the operation. See
        https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization/docs/using-breakglass for
        more information. Next update or deploy command will automatically
        clear existing breakglass justification.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --to-latest
          True to assign 100 percent of instances to the 'latest' revision of
          this service. Note that when a new revision is created, it will
          become the 'latest' and instances will be fully assigned to it unless
          configured otherwise using --[no-]promote flag. Defaults to False.
          Synonymous with '--to-revisions=LATEST=100'.

       --to-revisions=[REVISION-NAME=PERCENTAGE,...]
          Comma separated list of instance assignments in the form
          REVISION-NAME=PERCENTAGE. REVISION-NAME must be the name for a
          revision for the worker as returned by 'gcloud run workers revisions
          list --worker=WORKER' . PERCENTAGE must be an integer percentage
          between 0 and 100 inclusive. Ex worker-nw9hs=10,worker-nw9hs=20 Up to
          100 percent of instances may be assigned. If the total of 100 percent
          of instances is assigned, the Worker instance split is updated as
          specified. If under 100 percent of instance split is assigned, the
          Worker instance split is updated as specified for revisions with
          assignments and instance split is scaled up or down proportionally as
          needed for revision that are currently serving workload but that do
          not have new assignments. For example assume revision-1 is serving 40
          percent of workload and revision-2 is serving 60 percent. If
          revision-1 is assigned 45 percent of instances and no assignment is
          made for revision-2, the worker is updated with revsion-1 assigned 45
          percent of instances and revision-2 scaled down to 55 percent. You
          can use "LATEST" as a special revision name to always put the given
          percentage of instance split on the latest ready revision.

NOTES

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
