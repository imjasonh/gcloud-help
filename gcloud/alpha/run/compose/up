NAME
    gcloud alpha run compose up - deploy to Cloud Run from compose
        specification

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha run compose up [COMPOSE_FILE] [--[no-]allow-unauthenticated]

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deploy to Cloud Run from compose specification.

EXAMPLES
    To deploy a container from the source Compose file on Cloud Run:

        $ gcloud alpha run compose up compose.yaml

    To deploy to Cloud Run with unauthenticated access:

        $ gcloud alpha run compose up compose.yaml --allow-unauthenticated

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [COMPOSE_FILE]
        The compose yaml file to deploy from a Compose directory to Cloud Run.

FLAGS
     --[no-]allow-unauthenticated
        Whether to enable allowing unauthenticated access to the service. This
        may take a few moments to take effect. Use --allow-unauthenticated to
        enable and --no-allow-unauthenticated to disable.

     --dry-run
        If set to true, only validates the configuration. The configuration
        will not be applied.

     --region=REGION
        Region in which the resource can be found. Alternatively, set the
        property [run/region].

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --build
          Force build of images.

       --no-build
          Skip building from source if applicable.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in alpha and might change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the correct
    project, you might be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta run compose up
