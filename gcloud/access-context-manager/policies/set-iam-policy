    gcloud access-context-manager policies set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for
        an access policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud access-context-manager policies set-iam-policy [POLICY] POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Sets the IAM policy for a access policy, given access policy ID and a file
    encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy.

EXAMPLES
    The following command reads an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    policy.json and sets it for the access policy with the ID
    accessPolicies/1234:

        $ gcloud access-context-manager policies set-iam-policy \
            accessPolicies/1234 policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Policy resource - The access policy to set the IAM policy for. This
     represents a Cloud resource.

       [POLICY]
          ID of the policy or fully qualified identifier for the policy. To set
          the policy attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument policy on the command line;
          ▸ set the property access_context_manager/policy;
          ▸ automatically, if the current account belongs to an organization
            with exactly one access policy..

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
