    accessPolicies/1234:

        $ gcloud access-context-manager policies set-iam-policy \

        ◆ provide the argument policy on the command line;
        ◆ set the property access_context_manager/policy;
        ◆ automatically, if the current account belongs to an organization
          with exactly one access policy..
