DESCRIPTION
    When a Service Perimeter with the specified name does not exist, a new
    Service Perimeter will be created. In this case, the newly created Service
    Perimeter will not have any enforcement mode configuration, and, therefore,
    all policy violations will be logged.

    When a perimeter with the specified name does exist, a dry-run mode
    configuration will be created for it. The behavior of the enforcement mode
    configuration, if present, will not be impacted in this case. Requests that
    violate the existing enforcement mode configuration of the Service
    Perimeter will continue being denied. Requests that only violate the policy
    in the dry-run mode configuration will be logged but will not be denied.

EXAMPLES
    To create a dry-run configuration for an existing Service Perimeter:

        $ gcloud access-context-manager perimeters dry-run create \
            my-perimeter --resources="projects/0123456789" \
            --access-levels="accessPolicies/a_policy/accessLevels/a_level" \
            --restricted-services="storage.googleapis.com"

    To create a dry-run configuration for a new Service Perimeter:

        $ gcloud access-context-manager perimeters dry-run create \
            my-perimeter --perimeter-title="My New Perimeter" \
            --perimeter-description="Perimeter description" \
            --perimeter-type="regular" \
            --perimeter-resources="projects/0123456789" \
            --perimeter-access-levels="accessPolicies/a_policy/accessLevels/\
        a_level" --perimeter-restricted-services="storage.googleapis.com"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Perimeter resource - The service perimeter to update. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.

     This must be specified.

       PERIMETER
          ID of the perimeter or fully qualified identifier for the perimeter.
          To set the perimeter attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument perimeter on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --policy=POLICY
          The ID of the access policy. To set the policy attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument perimeter on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --policy on the command line;
          ▸ set the property access_context_manager/policy.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       Arguments for creating dry-run spec for an **existing** Service
       Perimeter.

         --access-levels=[access_levels,...]
            Comma-separated list of IDs for access levels (in the same policy)
            that an intra-perimeter request must satisfy to be allowed.

         --egress-policies=YAML_FILE
            Path to a file containing a list of Egress Policies. This file
            contains a list of YAML-compliant objects representing Egress
            Policies described in the API reference. For more information about
            the alpha version, see:

         --ingress-policies=YAML_FILE
            Path to a file containing a list of Ingress Policies. This file
            contains a list of YAML-compliant objects representing Ingress
            Policies described in the API reference. For more information about
            the alpha version, see:

         --resources=[resources,...]
            Comma-separated list of resources (currently only projects, in the
            form projects/<projectnumber>) in this perimeter.

         --restricted-services=[restricted_services,...]
            Comma-separated list of services to which the perimeter boundary
            does apply (for example, storage.googleapis.com).

         --enable-vpc-accessible-services
            Whether to restrict API calls within the perimeter to those in the
            vpc-allowed-services list.

         --vpc-allowed-services=[vpc_allowed_services,...]
            Comma-separated list of APIs accessible from within the Service
            Perimeter. In order to include all restricted services, use
            reference "RESTRICTED-SERVICES". Requires vpc-accessible-services
            be enabled.

       Arguments for creating a dry-run spec for a new Service Perimeter.

         --perimeter-title=PERIMETER_TITLE
            Short human-readable title for the Service Perimeter.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --perimeter-type=PERIMETER_TYPE
            Type of the perimeter.

                A *regular* perimeter allows resources within this service perimeter
                to import and export data amongst themselves. A project may belong
                to at most one regular service perimeter.

                A *bridge* perimeter allows resources in different regular service
                perimeters to import and export data between each other. A project
                may belong to multiple bridge service perimeters (only if it also
                belongs to a regular service perimeter). Both restricted and
                unrestricted service lists, as well as access level lists, must be
                empty.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.
