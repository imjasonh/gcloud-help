            --binding=my-binding-id \
            --level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-abc

            --binding=my-binding-id --binding-file='binding.yaml'

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Cloud access binding resource - The cloud access binding you want to
     update. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource.

     This must be specified.

       --binding=BINDING
          ID of the cloud-access-binding or fully qualified identifier for the
          cloud-access-binding.

          To set the binding attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --binding on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The ID of the organization.

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --binding on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --organization on the command line;

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --binding-file=YAML_FILE
        Path to the file that contains a Google Cloud Platform user access
        binding.

        This file contains a YAML-compliant object representing a
        GcpUserAccessBinding (as described in the API reference) containing
        ScopedAccessSettings only. No other binding fields are allowed.

        The file content replaces the corresponding fields in the existing
        binding.

     --dry-run-level=[DRY_RUN_LEVEL,...]
        The dry run access level that replaces the existing dry run level for
        the given binding. The input must be the full identifier of an access
        level, such as accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-def.

     --level=[LEVEL,...]
        The access level that replaces the existing level for the given
        binding. The input must be the full identifier of an access level, such
        as accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-abc.
