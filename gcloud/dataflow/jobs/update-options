NAME
    gcloud dataflow jobs update-options - update pipeline options on-the-fly
        for running Dataflow jobs

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud dataflow jobs update-options JOB_ID
        [--max-num-workers=MAX_NUM_WORKERS] [--min-num-workers=MIN_NUM_WORKERS]
        [--region=REGION_ID] [--unset-worker-utilization-hint]
        [--worker-utilization-hint=WORKER_UTILIZATION_HINT]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command can modify properties of running Dataflow jobs. Currently,
    only updating autoscaling settings for Streaming Engine jobs is supported.

    Adjust the autoscaling settings for Streaming Engine Dataflow jobs by
    providing at-least one of --min-num-workers or --max-num-workers or
    --worker-utilization-hint (or all 3), or --unset-worker-utilization-hint
    (which cannot be run at the same time as --worker-utilization-hint but
    works with the others). Allow a few minutes for the changes to take effect.

    Note that autoscaling settings can only be modified on-the-fly for
    Streaming Engine jobs. Attempts to modify batch job or Streaming Appliance
    jobs will fail.

EXAMPLES
    Modify autoscaling settings to scale between 5-10 workers:

        $ gcloud dataflow jobs update-options --min-num-workers=5 \
            --max-num-workers=10

    Require a job to use at least 2 workers:

        $ gcloud dataflow jobs update-options --min-num-workers=2

    Require a job to use at most 20 workers:

        $ gcloud dataflow jobs update-options --max-num-workers=20

    Adjust the hint of target worker utilization to 70% for horizontal
    autoscaling:

        $ gcloud dataflow jobs update-options --worker-utilization-hint=0.7

    "Unset" worker utilization hint so that horizontal scaling will rely on its
    default CPU utilization target:

        $ gcloud dataflow jobs update-options --unset-worker-utilization-hint

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     JOB_ID
        Job ID to operate on.

FLAGS
     --max-num-workers=MAX_NUM_WORKERS
        Upper-bound for autoscaling, between 1-1000. Only supported for
        streaming-engine jobs.

     --min-num-workers=MIN_NUM_WORKERS
        Lower-bound for autoscaling, between 1-1000. Only supported for
        streaming-engine jobs.

     --region=REGION_ID
        Region ID of the job's regional endpoint. Defaults to 'us-central1'.

     --unset-worker-utilization-hint
        Unset --worker-utilization-hint. This causes the job autoscaling to
        fall back to internal tunings if they exist, or otherwise use the
        default hint value.

     --worker-utilization-hint=WORKER_UTILIZATION_HINT
        Target CPU utilization for autoscaling, ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. Only
        supported for streaming-engine jobs with autoscaling enabled.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
