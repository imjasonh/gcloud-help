DESCRIPTION
    Create PolicyBinding instance.

EXAMPLES
    To create a policy binding instance called my-binding that references a
    principal access boundary policy run:

        $ gcloud iam policy-bindings create my-binding --organization=123 \
            --location=global \
            --policy=organizations/123/locations/global/\
        principalAccessBoundaryPolicies/my-policy \
            --target-principal-set=//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/\
        organizations/123

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PolicyBinding resource - Identifier. The name of the policy binding, in
     the format
     {binding_parent/locations/{location}/policyBindings/{policy_binding_id}.
     The binding parent is the closest Resource Manager resource (project,
     folder, or organization) to the binding target.

     Format:

      ◆ projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/policyBindings/{policy_binding_id}
      ◆ projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}/policyBindings/{policy_binding_id}
      ◆ folders/{folder_id}/locations/{location}/policyBindings/{policy_binding_id}
      ◆ organizations/{organization_id}/locations/{location}/policyBindings/{policy_binding_id}
        The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of
        this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
        group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument policy_binding on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project. This resource can be one of the
        following types: [iam.folders.locations.policyBindings,
        iam.organizations.locations.policyBindings,
        iam.projects.locations.policyBindings].

     This must be specified.

       POLICY_BINDING
          ID of the policyBinding or fully qualified identifier for the
          policyBinding.

          To set the policy_binding attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument policy_binding on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --folder=FOLDER
          The folder id of the policyBinding resource.

          To set the folder attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument policy_binding on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --folder on the command line. Must be
            specified for resource of type
            [iam.folders.locations.policyBindings].

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the policyBinding resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument policy_binding on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization id of the policyBinding resource.

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument policy_binding on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --organization on the command line. Must be
            specified for resource of type
            [iam.organizations.locations.policyBindings].

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --policy=POLICY
        The resource name of the policy to be bound. The binding parent and
        policy must belong to the same organization.

     The full resource name of the resource to which the policy will be bound.
     Immutable once set.

     This must be specified.

       Arguments for the target.

         --target-principal-set=TARGET_PRINCIPAL_SET
            The full resource name that's used for principal access boundary
            policy bindings. The principal set must be directly parented by the
            policy binding's parent or same as the parent if the target is a
            project, folder, or organization.

            Examples:

            ▫ For bindings parented by an organization:
              ◇ Organization:
                //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID
              ◇ Workforce Identity:
                //iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID
              ◇ Workspace Identity:
                //iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workspace/WORKSPACE_ID
            ▫ For bindings parented by a folder:
              ◇ Folder:
                //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/folders/FOLDER_ID

     --policy-kind=POLICY_KIND
        The kind of the policy to attach in this binding. This field must be

     Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL)
     syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of
     CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec.

     Example (Comparison):

         title: "Summary size limit"
         description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars"
         expression: "document.summary.size() < 100"

     Example (Equality):

         title: "Requestor is owner"
         description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner"
         expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email"

     Example (Logic):

         title: "Public documents"
         description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible"
         expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'"

     Example (Data Manipulation):

         title: "Notification string"
         description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp."
         expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)"

     The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an
     expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the
     service documentation for additional information.

       --condition-description=CONDITION_DESCRIPTION
          Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes
          the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.

       --condition-expression=CONDITION_EXPRESSION
          Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language
          syntax.

       --condition-location=CONDITION_LOCATION
          String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting,
          e.g. a file name and a position in the file.

       --condition-title=CONDITION_TITLE
          Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose.
          This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.
