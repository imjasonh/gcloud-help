NAME
    gcloud iam - manage IAM service accounts and keys

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud iam GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The gcloud iam command group lets you manage Google Cloud Identity & Access
    Management (IAM) service accounts and keys.

    Cloud IAM authorizes who can take action on specific resources, giving you
    full control and visibility to manage cloud resources centrally. For
    established enterprises with complex organizational structures, hundreds of
    workgroups and potentially many more projects, Cloud IAM provides a unified
    view into security policy across your entire organization, with built-in
    auditing to ease compliance processes.
