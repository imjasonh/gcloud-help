NAME
    gcloud iam service-accounts - create and manipulate service accounts

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud iam service-accounts GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create and manipulate IAM service accounts. A service account is a special
    Google account that belongs to your application or a VM, instead of to an
    individual end user. Your application uses the service account to call the
    Google API of a service, so that the users aren't directly involved.

    Note: Service accounts use client quotas for tracking usage.

    More information on service accounts can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts
