NAME
    gcloud ai endpoints - manage Vertex AI endpoints

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud ai endpoints COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    An endpoint contains one or more deployed models, all of which must have
    the same interface but may come from different models. An endpoint is to
    obtain online prediction and explanation from one of its deployed models.

    When you communicate with Vertex AI services, you identify a specific
    endpoint that is deployed in the cloud using a combination of the current
    project, the region, and the endpoint.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
