DESCRIPTION
    Create a new Memorystore for Redis Cluster instance, and uses Private
    Service Connect service connectivity automation to automate connectivity
    for instances.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ A cluster with the same name already exists.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to create clusters.
      ▪ Some required APIs not enabled yet.
      ▪ No connection policy defined yet on the network and in the region a
        cluster will be created.
      ▪ Miss the steps for creating and configuring a service account (to
        grant permissions) in both host project and service project, if a
        shared VPC network is used.

    Refer to
    https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/cluster/networking#prerequisites_required_before_creating_a_cluster
    for prerequisites.

EXAMPLES
    To create a cluster with name my-redis-cluster in region us-central1 with 3
    shards and with a discovery endpoint created on network "default", run:

        $ gcloud redis clusters create my-redis-cluster \
            --region=us-central1 --shard-count=3 \
            --network=projects/NETWORK_PROJECT_ID/global/networks/default

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - Arguments and flags that specify the cluster you want
     to create. Your cluster ID must be 1 to 63 characters and use only
     lowercase letters, numbers, or hyphens. It must start with a lowercase
     letter and end with a lowercase letter or number. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Redis region of the cluster. Overrides the default
          redis/region property value for this command invocation.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property redis/region.

         no
            Redis will not explicitly call fsync.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --auth-mode=AUTH_MODE
        Available authorization mode of a Redis cluster. AUTH_MODE must be one
        of:

     --automated-backup-ttl=AUTOMATED_BACKUP_TTL
        Time to live for automated backups. A backup will be deleted
        automatically after the TTL is reached. It ranges from 1 day to 365
        days. For example, "10d" for 10 days. If not specified, the default
        value is 35 days.
