DESCRIPTION
    Create a new Redis instance.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ An instance with the same name already exists.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to create instances.

EXAMPLES
    To create a basic tier instance with the name my-redis-instance in region
    us-central-1 with memory size of 5 GiB, run:

        $ gcloud redis instances create my-redis-instance \
            --region=us-central1 --size=5

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - Arguments and flags that specify the Memorystore Redis
     instance you want to create. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance.

          To set the instance attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Redis region of the instance. Overrides the default
          redis/region property value for this command invocation.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property redis/region.

FLAGS
     --alternative-zone=ALTERNATIVE_ZONE

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the Redis instance. If not provided the service will pick a
        random zone in the region. For the standard tier, instances will be
        created across two zones for protection against zonal failures. So if
        --alternative-zone is also provided, it must be different from --zone.
