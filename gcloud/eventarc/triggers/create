DESCRIPTION
    Create an Eventarc trigger.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new trigger my-trigger for events of type
    google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished with destination Cloud Run
    service my-service, run:

        $ gcloud eventarc triggers create my-trigger \
             --event-filters="type=google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublis\
         hed" --destination-run-service=my-service

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Trigger resource - The trigger to create. The arguments in this group can
     be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument trigger on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       TRIGGER
          ID of the trigger or fully qualified identifier for the trigger.

          To set the trigger attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument trigger on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location for the Eventarc trigger, which should be either global
          or one of the supported regions. Alternatively, set the
          [eventarc/location] property.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument trigger on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property eventarc/location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --event-filters=[ATTRIBUTE=VALUE,...]
        The trigger's list of filters that apply to CloudEvents attributes.
        This flag can be repeated to add more filters to the list. Only events
        that match all these filters will be sent to the destination. The
        filters must include the type attribute, as well as any other
        attributes that are expected for the chosen type.

         --destination-gke-namespace=DESTINATION_GKE_NAMESPACE
            Namespace that the destination GKE service is running in. If not
            specified, the default namespace is used.

         --destination-gke-path=DESTINATION_GKE_PATH
            Relative path on the destination GKE service to which the events

       Flags for specifying a Cloud Run fully-managed resource destination.

         --destination-run-service=DESTINATION_RUN_SERVICE
            Name of the Cloud Run fully-managed service that receives the
            events for the trigger. The service must be in the same project as
            the trigger.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --destination-run-path=DESTINATION_RUN_PATH

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     Channel resource - The channel to use in the trigger. The channel is
     needed only if trigger is created for a third-party provider. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --channel on the command line with a fully

     --event-data-content-type=EVENT_DATA_CONTENT_TYPE
        Depending on the event provider, you can specify the encoding of the

        either be encoded in application/json or application/protobuf. The
        default encoding is application/json. Note that for custom sources or
        third-party providers, or for direct events from Cloud Pub/Sub, this
        formatting option is not supported.

     --event-filters-path-pattern=[ATTRIBUTE=PATH_PATTERN,...]
        The trigger's list of filters in path pattern format that apply to
        CloudEvent attributes. This flag can be repeated to add more filters to
        the list. Only events that match all these filters will be sent to the
        destination. Currently, path pattern format is only available for the
        resourceName attribute for Cloud Audit Log events.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     Pub/Sub topic resource - The Cloud Pub/Sub topic to use for the trigger's
     transport intermediary. This feature is currently only available for
     triggers of event type google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished. The
     topic must be in the same project as the trigger. If not specified, a
     transport topic will be created. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --transport-topic on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       --transport-topic=TRANSPORT_TOPIC
          ID of the Pub/Sub topic or fully qualified identifier for the Pub/Sub
          topic.

          To set the transport-topic attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --transport-topic on the command line.
