DESCRIPTION
    Update an Eventarc trigger.

EXAMPLES
    To update the trigger my-trigger by setting its destination Cloud Run
    service to my-service, run:

        $ gcloud eventarc triggers update my-trigger \
             --destination-run-service=my-service

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Trigger resource - The trigger to update. The arguments in this group can
     be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument trigger on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       TRIGGER
          ID of the trigger or fully qualified identifier for the trigger.

          To set the trigger attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument trigger on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location for the Eventarc trigger, which should be either global
          or one of the supported regions. Alternatively, set the
          [eventarc/location] property.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument trigger on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property eventarc/location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --event-data-content-type=EVENT_DATA_CONTENT_TYPE
        Depending on the event provider, you can specify the encoding of the
        event data payload that will be delivered to your destination, to
        either be encoded in application/json or application/protobuf. The
        default encoding is application/json. Note that for custom sources or
        third-party providers, or for direct events from Cloud Pub/Sub, this
        formatting option is not supported.

     --event-filters=[ATTRIBUTE=VALUE,...]
        The trigger's list of filters that apply to CloudEvents attributes.
        This flag can be repeated to add more filters to the list. Only events
        that match all these filters will be sent to the destination. The
        filters must include the type attribute, as well as any other
        attributes that are expected for the chosen type.

     --event-filters-path-pattern=[ATTRIBUTE=PATH_PATTERN,...]
        The trigger's list of filters in path pattern format that apply to
        CloudEvent attributes. This flag can be repeated to add more filters to
        the list. Only events that match all these filters will be sent to the
        destination. Currently, path pattern format is only available for the
        resourceName attribute for Cloud Audit Log events.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Labels to apply to the trigger.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-service-account
          Clear the IAM service account associated with the trigger.

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          The IAM service account email associated with the trigger.

     Flags for updating the destination to which events should be sent.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       Flags for updating a GKE service destination.

         --destination-gke-namespace=DESTINATION_GKE_NAMESPACE
            Namespace that the destination GKE service is running in. If not
            specified, the default namespace is used.

         --destination-gke-service=DESTINATION_GKE_SERVICE
            Name of the destination GKE service that receives the events for
            the trigger.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --clear-destination-gke-path
              Clear the relative path on the destination GKE service to which
              the events for the trigger should be sent.

           --destination-gke-path=DESTINATION_GKE_PATH
              Relative path on the destination GKE service to which the events
              for the trigger should be sent. Examples: /route, route,
              route/subroute.

       Flags for updating a Cloud Run fully-managed resource destination.

         --destination-run-region=DESTINATION_RUN_REGION
            Region in which the destination Cloud Run service can be found. If
            not specified, it is assumed that the service is in the same region
            as the trigger.

         --destination-run-service=DESTINATION_RUN_SERVICE
            Name of the Cloud Run fully-managed service that receives the
            events for the trigger. The service must be in the same project as
            the trigger.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --clear-destination-run-path
              Clear the relative path on the destination Cloud Run service to
              which the events for the trigger should be sent.

           --destination-run-path=DESTINATION_RUN_PATH
              Relative path on the destination Cloud Run service to which the
              events for the trigger should be sent. Examples: /route, route,
              route/subroute.
