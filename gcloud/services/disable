NAME
    gcloud services disable - disable a service for consumption for a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud services disable [SERVICE ...] [--async] [--force]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command disables one or more previously-enabled services for
    consumption.

    To see a list of the enabled services for a project, run:

        $ gcloud services list

    More information on listing services can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/list-services and on disabling
    a service at: https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable

EXAMPLES
    To disable a service called my-consumed-service for the active project,
    run:

        $ gcloud services disable my-consumed-service

    To run the same command asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud services disable my-consumed-service --async

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [SERVICE ...]
        The name of the service(s) to disable.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --force
        If specified, the disable call will proceed even if there are enabled
        services which depend on the service to be disabled. Forcing the call
        means that the services which depend on the service to be disabled will
        also be disabled.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS

    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
