    gcloud sql instances clone SOURCE DESTINATION [--async]
        [--bin-log-file-name=BIN_LOG_FILE_NAME
          --bin-log-position=BIN_LOG_POSITION | [--point-in-time=POINT_IN_TIME

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud sql instances clone creates a clone of a Cloud SQL instance. The
    clone is an independent copy of the source instance with the same data and
    settings. Source and destination instances must be in the same project. An
    instance can be cloned from its current state, or from an earlier point in
    time.

    For MySQL: The binary log coordinates or timestamp (point in time), if
    specified, act as the point in time the source instance is cloned from. If
    not specified, the current state of the instance is cloned.

    For PostgreSQL: The point in time, if specified, defines a past state of
    the instance to clone. If not specified, the current state of the instance
    is cloned.

    For SQL Server: The point in time, if specified, defines a past state of
    the instance to clone. If not specified, the current state of the instance
    is cloned.

EXAMPLES
    To clone an instance from its current state (most recent binary log
    coordinates):

        $ gcloud sql instances clone instance-foo instance-bar

    To clone a MySQL instance from an earlier point in time (past binary log
    coordinates):

        $ gcloud sql instances clone instance-foo instance-bar \
            --bin-log-file-name mysql-bin.000020 --bin-log-position 170

    To clone a MySQL source instance at a specific point in time:

        $ gcloud sql instances clone instance-foo instance-bar \
            --point-in-time '2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z'

    To clone a PostgreSQL source instance at a specific point in time:

        $ gcloud sql instances clone instance-foo instance-bar \
            --point-in-time '2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z'

    To clone a SQL Server source instance at a specific point in time:

        $ gcloud sql instances clone instance-foo instance-bar \
            --point-in-time '2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SOURCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID of the source.

     DESTINATION
        Cloud SQL instance ID of the clone.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       Binary log coordinates for point-in-time recovery.

         --bin-log-file-name=BIN_LOG_FILE_NAME
            The name of the binary log file. Enable point-in-time recovery on
            the source instance to create a binary log file. If specified with
            <--bin-log-position> to form a valid binary log coordinate, it
            defines an earlier point in time to clone a source instance from.
            For example, mysql-bin.000001.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --bin-log-position=BIN_LOG_POSITION
            Represents the state of an instance at any given point in time
            inside a binary log file. If specified along with
            <--bin-log-file-name> to form a valid binary log coordinate, it
            defines an earlier point in time to clone a source instance from.
            For example, 123 (a numeric value).

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

       --point-in-time=POINT_IN_TIME
          Represents the state of an instance at any given point in time inside
          a transaction log file. For MySQL, the binary log file is used for
          transaction logs. For PostgreSQL, the write-ahead log file is used
          for transaction logs. For SQL Server, the log backup file is used for
          such purpose. To create a transaction log, enable point-in-time
          recovery on the source instance. Instance should have transaction
          logs accumulated up to the point in time they want to restore up to.
          Uses RFC 3339 format in UTC timezone. If specified, defines a past
          state of the instance to clone. For example,
          '2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z'.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --preferred-zone=PREFERRED_ZONE
          The preferred zone for the cloned instance. If set, the destination
          instance will be created in this zone.

       --restore-database-name=RESTORE_DATABASE_NAME
          The name of the database to be restored for a point-in-time restore.
          If set, the destination instance will only restore the specified
          database.
