FLAGS
     --activation-policy=ACTIVATION_POLICY
        Activation policy for this instance. This specifies when the instance
        should be activated and is applicable only when the instance state is
        RUNNABLE. The default is on-demand. More information on activation
        policies can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/start-stop-restart-instance#activation_policy.

     --memory=MEMORY
        Whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
        machine. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MiB or 9GiB) - if no
        units are specified, GiB is assumed. Both --cpu and --memory must be
        specified if a custom machine type is desired, and the --tier flag must
        be omitted.

     --network=NETWORK
        Network in the current project that the instance will be part of. To
        specify using a network with a shared VPC, use the full URL of the
        network. For an example host project, 'testproject', and shared
        network, 'testsharednetwork', this would use the form:
        --network=projects/testproject/global/networks/testsharednetwork

     --password-policy-complexity=PASSWORD_POLICY_COMPLEXITY
        The complexity of the password. PASSWORD_POLICY_COMPLEXITY must be one
        of:

         COMPLEXITY_DEFAULT

        Minimum number of characters allowed in the password.

     --password-policy-password-change-interval=PASSWORD_POLICY_PASSWORD_CHANGE_INTERVAL
        Minimum interval after which the password can be changed, for example,
        2m for 2 minutes. See <a href="/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/datetimes">
        $ gcloud topic datetimes</a> for information on duration formats.

     --password-policy-reuse-interval=PASSWORD_POLICY_REUSE_INTERVAL

        Use --require-ssl to enable and --no-require-ssl to disable.

     --storage-auto-increase
        Storage size can be increased, but it cannot be decreased; storage
        increases are permanent for the life of the instance. With this setting
        enabled, a spike in storage requirements can result in permanently
        increased storage costs for your instance. However, if an instance runs
        out of available space, it can result in the instance going offline,
        dropping existing connections. This setting is enabled by default.

     --storage-size=STORAGE_SIZE
        Amount of storage allocated to the instance. Must be an integer number
        of GB. The default is 10GB. Information on storage limits can be found
        here: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/quotas#storage_limits

     --tier=TIER, -t TIER
        Machine type for a shared-core instance e.g. db-g1-small. For all other
        instances, instead of using tiers, customize your instance by
        specifying its CPU and memory. You can do so with the --cpu and
        --memory flags. Learn more about how CPU and memory affects pricing:

          instance.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --authorized-networks=NETWORK,[NETWORK,...]
          The list of external networks that are allowed to connect to the
          instance. Specified in CIDR notation, also known as 'slash' notation
          (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24).

          The value given for this argument replaces the existing list.

       --clear-authorized-networks

          Clear the database flags set on the instance. WARNING: Instance will
          be restarted.

       --database-flags=FLAG=VALUE,[FLAG=VALUE,...]
          Comma-separated list of database flags to set on the instance. Use an
          equals sign to separate flag name and value. Flags without values,
          like skip_grant_tables, can be written out without a value after,
          e.g., skip_grant_tables=. Use on/off for booleans. View the Instance
          Resource API for allowed flags. (e.g., --database-flags
          max_allowed_packet=55555,skip_grant_tables=,log_output=1)

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --gce-zone=GCE_ZONE
