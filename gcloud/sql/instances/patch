        Allow/Disallow replica recreation when a primary MySQL instance
        operating in reduced durability mode crashes. Not recreating the
        replicas might lead to data inconsistencies between the primary and its
        replicas. This setting is only applicable for MySQL instances and is
        enabled by default. Use --recreate-replicas-on-primary-crash to enable
        and --no-recreate-replicas-on-primary-crash to disable.

        increases are permanent for the life of the instance. With this setting
        enabled, a spike in storage requirements can result in permanently
        increased storage costs for your instance. However, if an instance runs
        out of available space, it can result in the instance going offline,
        dropping existing connections. This setting is enabled by default. Use
        --storage-auto-increase to enable and --no-storage-auto-increase to
        disable.

        To disable SMT, set this flag to 1. Only available in Cloud SQL for SQL
        Server instances.

     --tier=TIER, -t TIER
        Machine type for a shared-core instance e.g. db-g1-small. For all other
        instances, instead of using tiers, customize your instance by
        specifying its CPU and memory. You can do so with the --cpu and
        --memory flags. Learn more about how CPU and memory affects pricing:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing. WARNING: Instance will be
        restarted.

     --upgrade-sql-network-architecture
        Upgrade from old network architecture to new network architecture. The
        new network architecture offers better isolation, reliability, and
        faster new feature adoption.

       --retained-transaction-log-days=RETAINED_TRANSACTION_LOG_DAYS
          How many days of transaction logs to keep. The valid range is between
          1 and 35. Only use this option when point-in-time recovery is
          enabled. If logs are stored on disk, storage size for transaction
          logs could increase when the number of days for log retention
          increases. For Enterprise, default and max retention values are 7 and
          7 respectively. For Enterprise_Plus, default and max retention values
          are 14 and 35.
