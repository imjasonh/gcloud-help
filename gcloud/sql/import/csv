        Path to the CSV file in Google Cloud Storage from which the import is

        files (.gz) are also supported.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --database=DATABASE, -d DATABASE
        The database (for example, guestbook) to which the import is made.

     --table=TABLE
        The database table to import csv file into.

        complete.

     --columns=COLUMNS,[COLUMNS,...]
        The columns to import from csv file. These correspond to actual
        database columns to import. If not set, all columns from csv file are
        imported to corresponding database columns.

     --escape=ESCAPE
        Specifies the character that should appear before a data character that
        needs to be escaped. The value of this argument has to be a character
        in Hex ASCII Code. For example, "22" represents double quotes. This
        flag is only available for MySQL and Postgres. If this flag is not
        provided, double quotes character will be used as the default value.

     --fields-terminated-by=FIELDS_TERMINATED_BY
        Specifies the character that splits column values. The value of this
        argument has to be a character in Hex ASCII Code. For example, "2C"
        represents a comma. This flag is only available for MySQL and Postgres.
        If this flag is not provided, a comma character will be used as the
        default value.

     --lines-terminated-by=LINES_TERMINATED_BY
        Specifies the character that split line records. The value of this
        argument has to be a character in Hex ASCII Code. For example, "0A"
        represents a new line. This flag is only available for MySQL. If this
        flag is not provided, a new line character will be used as the default
        value.

     --quote=QUOTE
        Specifies the character that encloses values from columns that have
        string data type. The value of this argument has to be a character in
        Hex ASCII Code. For example, "22" represents double quotes. This flag
        is only available for MySQL and Postgres. If this flag is not provided,
        double quotes character will be used as the default value.
