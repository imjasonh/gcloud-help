NAME
    gcloud beta netapp - create and manipulate Cloud NetApp Files resources

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta netapp GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) The gcloud netapp command group lets you create, configure and
    manipulate Cloud NetApp Volumes resources such as Volumes, Storage Pools,
    Active Directories, KMS Configs, Volume Snapshots, and Volume Replications
    etc.

    With Cloud NetApp Volumes, you can take advantage of Google Cloud
    Platform's scale, performance and value to manage and run on-prem NetApp
    Files solutions on Google infrastructure, so you don't have to modernize
    your file workloads, and allow for legacy feature support.
