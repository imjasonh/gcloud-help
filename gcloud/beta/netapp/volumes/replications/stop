NAME
    gcloud beta netapp volumes replications stop - stop a Cloud NetApp Volume
        Replication

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta netapp volumes replications stop
        (REPLICATION : --location=LOCATION) [--async] [--force]
        [--volume=VOLUME] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Stop a Cloud NetApp Volume Replication

EXAMPLES
    The following command stops a Replication named NAME using the required
    arguments

        $ gcloud beta netapp volumes replications stop NAME \
          --location=us-central1 --volume=vol1

    To stop a Replication named NAME asynchronously, run the following command:

        $ gcloud beta netapp volumes replications stop NAME \
          --location=us-central1 --volume=vol1 --async

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Replication resource - The Replication to create. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument replication on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     To set the volume attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument replication on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --volume on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       REPLICATION
          ID of the replication or fully qualified identifier for the
          replication.

          To set the replication attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument replication on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the replication.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument replication on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property netapp/location;
          ▸ set the property netapp/region.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --force
        Indicates whether to stop replication forcefully while data transfer is
        in progress. Warning! if force is true, this will abort any current
        transfers and can lead to data loss due to partial transfer. If force
        is false, stop replication will fail while data transfer is in progress
        and you will need to retry later.

     Volume resource - The Volume that the Replication is based on This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --volume on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     To set the location attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --volume on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line;
      ◆ set the property netapp/location;
      ◆ set the property netapp/region.

       --volume=VOLUME
          ID of the volume or fully qualified identifier for the volume.

          To set the volume attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --volume on the command line.
