NAME
    gcloud beta asset search-all-resources - searches all Cloud resources
        within the specified accessible scope, such as a project, folder or
        organization

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta asset search-all-resources [--asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]]
        [--order-by=ORDER_BY] [--query=QUERY] [--scope=SCOPE]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Searches all Cloud resources within the specified scope, such as a
    project, folder or organization. The caller must be granted the
    cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources permission on the desired scope.

EXAMPLES
    To search all Cloud resources whose full resource name contains xyz as a
    prefix of any word, within organizations/123456, ensure the caller has been
    granted the cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources permission on the
    organization and run:

        $ gcloud beta asset search-all-resources \
            --scope='organizations/123456' --query='name:xyz*'

FLAGS
     --asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]
        A list of asset types that this request searches for. If empty, it will
        search all the searchable asset types
        (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types).

        Regular expressions are also supported. For example:

        ◆ compute.googleapis.com.* snapshots resources whose asset type
          starts with compute.googleapis.com.
        ◆ .*Instance snapshots resources whose asset type ends with Instance.
        ◆ .*Instance.* snapshots resources whose asset type contains
          Instance.

        See RE2 (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for all supported
        regular expression syntax. If the regular expression does not match any
        supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.

     --order-by=ORDER_BY
        A comma-separated list of fields specifying the sorting order of the
        results. The default order is ascending. Add DESC after the field name
        to indicate descending order. Redundant space characters are ignored.
        Example: location DESC, name. Only singular primitive fields in the
        response are sortable:

        ◆ name
        ◆ assetType
        ◆ project
        ◆ displayName
        ◆ description
        ◆ location
        ◆ createTime
        ◆ updateTime
        ◆ state
        ◆ parentFullResourceName
        ◆ parentAssetType

        All the other fields such as repeated fields (e.g., networkTags,
        kmsKeys), map fields (e.g., labels) and struct fields (e.g.,
        additionalAttributes) are not supported.

        Both --order-by and --sort-by flags can be used to sort the output,
        with the following differences:

        ◆ The --order-by flag performs server-side sorting (better
          performance), while the --sort-by flag performs client-side sorting.
        ◆ The --sort-by flag supports all the fields in the output, while the
          --order-by flag only supports limited fields as shown above.

     --query=QUERY
        The query statement. See how to construct a query
        (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-resources#how_to_construct_a_query)
        for more details. If not specified or empty, it will search all the
        resources within the specified scope.

          Important as a word.

     --scope=SCOPE
        A scope can be a project, a folder, or an organization. The search is
        limited to the Cloud resources within this scope. The caller must be
        granted the cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources permission on the
        desired scope. If not specified, the configured project property
        (https://cloud.google.com//sdk/docs/configurations#setting_configuration_properties)
        will be used. To find the configured project, run: gcloud config get
        project. To change the setting, run: gcloud config set project
        PROJECT_ID.

        The allowed values are:

        ◆ projects/{PROJECT_ID} (e.g., projects/foo-bar)
        ◆ projects/{PROJECT_NUMBER} (e.g., projects/12345678)
        ◆ folders/{FOLDER_NUMBER} (e.g., folders/1234567)
        ◆ organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER} (e.g. organizations/123456)

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud asset search-all-resources
