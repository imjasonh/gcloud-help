    gcloud beta asset query - query the Cloud assets

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta asset query
        (--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID)
        (--job-reference=JOB_REFERENCE | --statement=STATEMENT)
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--page-token=PAGE_TOKEN] [--timeout=TIMEOUT]
        [--snapshot-time=SNAPSHOT_TIME
          | [--start-time=START_TIME : --end-time=END_TIME]]
        [--write-disposition=WRITE_DISPOSITION [--bigquery-table=BIGQUERY_TABLE
          : --bigquery-dataset=BIGQUERY_DATASET]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Issue an analytical query on Cloud assets using BigQuery Standard
    SQL compatible statement.

EXAMPLES
    To count the number of compute instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta asset query --project='test-project' \
            --statement='SELECT * FROM compute_googleapis_com_Instance'

    To see the query result of previous job, pass the job-reference from
    previous response:

        $ gcloud beta asset query --project='test-project' \
            --job-reference=<job-reference-from>

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The ID of the folder which is the root asset.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The ID of the organization which is the root asset.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The project which is the root asset.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

     The query or job reference of the query request.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --job-reference=JOB_REFERENCE
          Reference to the query job, which is from the previous call.

       --statement=STATEMENT
          A BigQuery Standard SQL compatible statement. If the query execution
          finishes within timeout and there is no pagination, the full query
          results will be returned. Otherwise, pass job_reference from previous
          call as --job-referrence to obtain the full results.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        The maximum number of rows to return in the results. One page is also
        limited to 10 MB.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        A page token received from previous call.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        Maximum amount of time that the client will wait for the query to
        complete.

     Specifies what time period or point in time to query asset metadata at.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --snapshot-time=SNAPSHOT_TIME
          Timestamp to take a snapshot on assets. This can only be a current or
          past time. If not specified, the current time will be used. Due to
          delays in resource data collection and indexing, there is a volatile
          window during which running the same query at different times may
          return different results. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on time formats.

       Specifies what time period or point in time to query asset metadata at.

         --start-time=START_TIME
            Start time of the time window (inclusive) for the asset history.
            Must be after the current time minus 35 days. See $ gcloud topic
            datetimes for information on time formats.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --end-time=END_TIME
            End time of the time window (exclusive) for the asset history.
            Defaults to current time if not specified. See $ gcloud topic
            datetimes for information on time formats.

     The BigQuery destination for query system.

       --write-disposition=WRITE_DISPOSITION
          Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table or
          partition already exists. WRITE_DISPOSITION must be one of:

           write-append
              AIf the table or partition already exists, BigQuery appends the
              data to the table or the latest partition.
           write-empty
              If the table already exists and contains data, an error is
              returned.
           write-truncate
              If the table or partition already exists, BigQuery overwrites the
              entire table or all the partition's data.

       Table resource - The bigquery-table for the export. The arguments in
       this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.
       (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
       set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
        ▸ provide the argument --bigquery-table on the command line with a
          fully specified name;
        ▸ provide the argument --project on the command line;
        ▸ set the property core/project.

         --bigquery-table=BIGQUERY_TABLE
            ID of the table or fully qualified identifier for the table. To set
            the table attribute:
            ▫ provide the argument --bigquery-table on the command line.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --bigquery-dataset=BIGQUERY_DATASET
            The id of the BigQuery dataset. To set the bigquery-dataset
            attribute:
            ▫ provide the argument --bigquery-table on the command line with
              a fully specified name;
            ▫ provide the argument --bigquery-dataset on the command line.

    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
