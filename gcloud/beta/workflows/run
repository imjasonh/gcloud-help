POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Workflow resource - Name of the workflow to execute. The arguments in this

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument workflow on the command line with a fully
        specified name;

      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.
