POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Workstation resource - The group of arguments defining a workstation The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument workstation on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       WORKSTATION
          ID of the workstation or fully qualified identifier for the
          workstation.

          To set the workstation attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workstation on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --cluster=CLUSTER
          The cluster for the workstation.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workstation on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --cluster on the command line;
          ▸ set the property workstations/cluster.

       --config=CONFIG
          The config for the workstation.

          To set the config attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workstation on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --config on the command line;
          ▸ set the property workstations/config.

       --region=REGION
          The region for the workstation.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument workstation on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property workstations/region.

     [-- SSH_ARGS ...]
        Flags and positionals passed to the underlying ssh implementation.

        The '--' argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
        left and SSH_ARGS on the right.

FLAGS
     --command=COMMAND
        A command to run on the workstation.

        Runs the command on the target workstation and then exits.

     --local-host-port=LOCAL_HOST_PORT; default="localhost:0"
        LOCAL_HOST:LOCAL_PORT on which gcloud should bind and listen for
        connections that should be tunneled.

        LOCAL_PORT may be omitted, in which case it is treated as 0 and an
        arbitrary unused local port is chosen. The colon also may be omitted in
        that case.

        If LOCAL_PORT is 0, an arbitrary unused local port is chosen.

     --port=PORT; default=22
        The port on the workstation to which traffic should be sent.

     --ssh-flag=SSH_FLAG
        Additional flags to be passed to ssh(1). It is recommended that flags
        be passed using an assignment operator and quotes. Example:

            $ gcloud beta workstations ssh --ssh-flag="-vvv" \
                --ssh-flag="-L 80:localhost:80"

     --user=USER; default="user"
        The username with which to SSH.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
