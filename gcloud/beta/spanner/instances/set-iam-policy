DESCRIPTION

    and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy.

EXAMPLES
    The following command reads an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    policy.json and sets it for a spanner instance with the ID
    example-instance:

        $ gcloud beta spanner instances set-iam-policy example-instance \
            policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - The Spanner instance to set the IAM policy for. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property spanner/instance with a fully specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

       [INSTANCE]
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance. To
          set the instance attribute:

          ▸ set the property spanner/instance.

     POLICY_FILE
