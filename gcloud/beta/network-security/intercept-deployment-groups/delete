        my-deployment-group

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Intercept deployment group resource - Intercept Deployment Group. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument INTERCEPT_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP on the command line
        with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       INTERCEPT_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP
          ID of the intercept deployment group or fully qualified identifier
          for the intercept deployment group.

          To set the deployment-group-id attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument INTERCEPT_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP on the command
            line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the intercept deployment group.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument INTERCEPT_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP on the command
            line with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="20m"
        Time to synchronously wait for the operation to complete, after which
        the operation continues asynchronously. Ignored if --no-async isn't
        specified. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
        formats.
