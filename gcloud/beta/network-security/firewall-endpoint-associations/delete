          To set the association-name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument FIREWALL_ENDPOINT_ASSOCIATION on the command
            line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other

FLAGS
     --async

     --max-wait=MAX_WAIT; default="60m"
        Time to synchronously wait for the operation to complete, after which
        the operation continues asynchronously. Ignored if --no-async isn't
