        recommendation's state as CLAIMED

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta recommender recommendations mark-claimed RECOMMENDATION
        --etag=ETAG --location=LOCATION --recommender=RECOMMENDER
        (--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID)
        [--state-metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Mark a recommendation's state as CLAIMED. Can be applied to
    recommendations in CLAIMED, SUCCEEDED, FAILED, or ACTIVE state. Users can
    use this method to indicate to the Recommender API that they are starting
    to apply the recommendation themselves. This stops the recommendation
    content from being updated.
