NAME
    gcloud beta recommender insights list - list insights for Google Cloud
        resources

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta recommender insights list
        (--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID)
        [--insight-type=INSIGHT_TYPE] [--location=LOCATION] [--[no-]recursive]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command lists all insights for the specified Google Cloud
    resource, location, and insight type. If an insight type or location is not
    specified, insights for all supported insight types or locations,
    respectively, are listed. If the --recursive flag is set, insights for
    child resources and projects are also listed. Supported insight types can
    be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/insights/insight-types.

EXAMPLES
    To list all insights for a billing account:

        $ gcloud beta recommender insights list --project=project-id \
            --location=global --insight-type=google.compute.firewall.Insight

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Resource that is associated with cloud entity type. Currently four
     mutually exclusive flags are supported, --project, --billing-account,
     --folder, --organization.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT
          The Google Cloud Platform billing account ID to use for this
          invocation.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform folder ID to use for this invocation.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform organization ID to use for this invocation.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform project ID. Overrides the default
          core/project property value for this command invocation.

FLAGS
     --insight-type=INSIGHT_TYPE
        Insight type to list insights for. If no insight type is specified,
        insights for all supported insight types are listed. Supported insight
        types can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/insights/insight-types Not
        specifying an insight-type can add a minute to the runtime.

     --location=LOCATION
        Location to list insights for. If no location is specified, insights
        for all supported locations are listed. Not specifying a location can
        add 15-20 seconds to the runtime.

     --[no-]recursive
        In addition to listing the insights for the specified organization or
        folder, recursively list all of the insights for the resource's child
        resources, including their descendants (for example, a folder's
        sub-folders), and for the resource's child projects. For example, when
        using the --recursive flag and specifying an organization, the response
        lists all of the insights associated with that organization, all of the
        insights associated with that organization's folders and sub-folders,
        and all of the insights associated with that organization's child
        projects. The maximum number of resources (organization, folders,
        projects, and descendant resources) that can be accessed at once with
        the --recursive flag is 100. For a larger number of nested resources,
        use BigQuery export
        (https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/bq-export/export-recommendations-to-bq).
        Using --recursive can add 15-20 seconds per resource to the runtime.
        Use --recursive to enable and --no-recursive to disable.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud recommender insights list

        $ gcloud alpha recommender insights list
