NAME
    gcloud beta recommender - manage Cloud recommendations and recommendation
        rules

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta recommender GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Recommender allows you to retrieve recommendations for Cloud
    resources, helping you to improve security, save costs, and more. Each
    recommendation includes a suggested action, its justification, and its
    impact. Recommendations are grouped into a per-resource collection. To
    apply a recommendation, you must use the desired service's API, not the
    Recommender. Interact with and manage resources in Cloud Recommender.
