NAME
    gcloud beta iam service-accounts get-iam-policy - get the IAM policy for a
        service account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta iam service-accounts get-iam-policy SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command gets the IAM policy for a service account. If formatted
    as JSON, the output can be edited and used as a policy file for
    set-iam-policy. The output includes an "etag" field identifying the version
    emitted and allowing detection of concurrent policy updates; see $ gcloud
    iam service-accounts set-iam-policy for additional details.

    If the service account does not exist, this command returns a
    PERMISSION_DENIED error.

    When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a
    resource or as an identity. This command is to get the iam policy of a
    service account resource. There are other gcloud commands to manage IAM
    policies for other types of resources. For example, to manage IAM policies
    on a project, use the $ gcloud projects commands.

EXAMPLES
    To print the IAM policy for a given service account, run:

        $ gcloud beta iam service-accounts get-iam-policy \
            my-iam-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        The service account whose policy to get. The account should be
        formatted either as a numeric service account ID or as an email, like
        this: 123456789876543212345 or my-iam-account@somedomain.com.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
