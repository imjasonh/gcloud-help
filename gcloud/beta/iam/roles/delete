NAME
    gcloud beta iam roles delete - delete a custom role from an organization or
        a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta iam roles delete ROLE_ID
        (--organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT_ID)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command deletes a role.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The role specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active user does not have permission to access the given role.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the role ProjectUpdater of the organization 1234567, run:

        $ gcloud beta iam roles delete ProjectUpdater --organization=1234567

    To delete the role ProjectUpdater of the project myproject, run:

        $ gcloud beta iam roles delete ProjectUpdater --project=myproject

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ROLE_ID
        The id of the custom role to delete. For example: CustomRole. You must
        also specify the --organization or --project flag.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization of the role you want to delete.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The project of the role you want to delete.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,

    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
