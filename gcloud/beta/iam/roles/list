NAME
    gcloud beta iam roles list - list predefined roles, or the custom roles for
        an organization or project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta iam roles list [--show-deleted]
        [--organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) When an organization or project is specified, this command lists the
    custom roles that are defined for that organization or project.

    Otherwise, this command lists IAM's predefined roles.

EXAMPLES
    To list custom roles for the organization 12345, run:

        $ gcloud beta iam roles list --organization=12345

    To list custom roles for the project myproject, run:

        $ gcloud beta iam roles list --project=myproject

    To list all predefined roles, run:

        $ gcloud beta iam roles list

FLAGS
     --show-deleted
        Show deleted roles by specifying this flag.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization of the role you want to list.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The project of the role you want to list.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
