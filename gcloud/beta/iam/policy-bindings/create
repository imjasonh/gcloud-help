DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create PolicyBinding instance.

EXAMPLES
    To create a policy binding instance called my-binding that references a
    principal access boundary policy run:

        $ gcloud beta iam policy-bindings create my-binding \
            --organization=123 --location=global \
            --policy=organizations/123/locations/global/\
        principalAccessBoundaryPolicies/my-policy \
            --target-principal-set=//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/\
        organizations/123

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PolicyBinding resource - Identifier. The resource name of the policy
     binding. The binding parent is the closest CRM resource (i.e., Project,
     Folder or Organization) to the binding target.

     Format:
     projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/policyBindings/{policy_binding_id}
     projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}/policyBindings/{policy_binding_id}
     folders/{folder_id}/locations/{location}/policyBindings/{policy_binding_id}
     organizations/{organization_id}/locations/{location}/policyBindings/{policy_binding_id}

     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument policy_binding on the command line with a fully
        specified name;

        policy must belong to the same Organization (or Project).

     Target is the full resource name of the resource to which the policy will
     be bound. Immutable once set.

     This must be specified.

       Arguments for the target.

         --target-principal-set=TARGET_PRINCIPAL_SET
            Full Resource Name used for principal access boundary policy
            bindings Examples: Organization:
            "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID"
            Folder: "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/folders/FOLDER_ID"
            Project:
            "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER"
            "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_ID"

     --policy-kind=POLICY_KIND
        The kind of the policy to attach in this binding:

        + When the policy is empty, this field must be set. + When the policy
        is set, this field + can be left empty and will be set to the policy
        kind, or + must set to the input policy kind

        POLICY_KIND must be (only one value is supported):

         principal-access-boundary
            Principal access boundary policy kind

     Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL)
     syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of
     CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec.

     Example (Comparison):

         title: "Summary size limit"
         description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars"
         expression: "document.summary.size() < 100"

     Example (Equality):

         title: "Requestor is owner"
         description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner"
         expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email"

     Example (Logic):

         title: "Public documents"
         description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible"
         expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'"

     Example (Data Manipulation):

         title: "Notification string"
         description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp."
         expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)"

     The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an
     expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the
     service documentation for additional information.

       --condition-description=CONDITION_DESCRIPTION
          Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes
          the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.

       --condition-expression=CONDITION_EXPRESSION
          Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language
          syntax.

       --condition-location=CONDITION_LOCATION
          String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting,
          e.g. a file name and a position in the file.

       --condition-title=CONDITION_TITLE
          Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose.
          This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.
