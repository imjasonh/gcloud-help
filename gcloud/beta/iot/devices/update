NAME
    gcloud beta iot devices update - update an existing device

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta iot devices update
        (DEVICE : --region=REGION --registry=REGISTRY)
        [--auth-method=AUTH_METHOD] [--blocked] [--log-level=LOG_LEVEL]
        [--metadata=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [--metadata-from-file=[KEY=PATH,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update an existing device.

EXAMPLES
    The following command updates the device 'my-device' in device registry
    'my-registry' in region 'us-central1'. It blocks the device and sets
    metadata values.

        $ gcloud beta iot devices update my-device --region=us-central1 \
            --registry=my-registry --blocked \
            --metadata=key1=value1,key2=value2

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Device resource - The device to update. The arguments in this group can be
     used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument device on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       DEVICE
          ID of the device or fully qualified identifier for the device. To set
          the device attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument device on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud region for the device. To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument device on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line.

       --registry=REGISTRY
          The device registry for the device. To set the registry attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument device on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --registry on the command line.

FLAGS
     --auth-method=AUTH_METHOD
        The authorization/authentication method used by devices in relation to
        the gateway. This property is set only on gateways. If left
        unspecified, devices will not be able to access the gateway.
        AUTH_METHOD must be one of:

         association-and-device-auth-token
            The device is authenticated through both device credentials and
            gateway association.
         association-only
            The device is authenticated through the gateway association only.
            Device credentials are ignored if provided.
         device-auth-token-only
            The device is authenticated through its own credentials. Gateway
            association is not checked.

     --blocked
        If blocked, connections from this device will fail.

        Can be used to temporarily prevent the device from connecting if, for
        example, the sensor is generating bad data and needs maintenance.

        Use --no-blocked to enable connections and --blocked to disable.

     --log-level=LOG_LEVEL
        The default logging verbosity for activity from devices in this
        registry. The verbosity level can be overridden by setting a specific
        device's log level.

        LOG_LEVEL must be one of:

         debug
            All events will be logged
         error
            Error events will be logged.
         info
            Informational events will be logged, such as connections and
            disconnections. Also includes error events.
         none
            Disables logging.

     --metadata=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        The metadata key/value pairs assigned to devices. This metadata is not
        interpreted or indexed by Cloud IoT Core. It can be used to add
        contextual information for the device.

        Keys should only contain the following characters [a-zA-Z0-9-_] and be
        fewer than 128 bytes in length. Values are free-form strings. Each
        value must be fewer than or equal to 32 KB in size.

        The total size of all keys and values must be less than 256 KB, and the
        maximum number of key-value pairs is 500.

     --metadata-from-file=[KEY=PATH,...]
        Same as --metadata, but the metadata values will be read from the file
        specified by path.
