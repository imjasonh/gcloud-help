    List all security marks for testFinding under folder 456 and source 5678:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings list-marks \
            folders/456/sources/5678/findings/testFinding

    List all security marks for testFinding under organization 123456, source
    5678 and location=eu:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings list-marks `testFinding` \
            --organization=123456 --source=5678 --location=eu

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Finding resource - The finding to be used for the SCC (Security Command
     Center) command. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource.

     This must be specified.

       FINDING
          ID of the finding or fully qualified identifier for the finding.

          To set the finding attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument finding on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123, then provide the organization id which is the
          suffix of the organization. Example: organizations/123, the id is
          123.

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument finding on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --organization on the command line;
          ▸ Set the organization property in configuration using gcloud
            config set scc/organization if it is not specified in command
            line..

       --source=SOURCE
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123/sources/456, then provide the source id which is
          the suffix of the source. Example: organizations/123/sources/456, the
          id is 456.

          To set the source attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument finding on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --source on the command line.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the
        location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location
        attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name
        or with the --location argument on the command line. The default
        location is global.

        The default location on this command is unrelated to the default
        location that is specified when data residency controls are enabled for
        Security Command Center.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        Response objects will return a non-null value for page-token to
        indicate that there is at least one additional page of data. User can
        either directly request that page by specifying the page-token
        explicitly or let gcloud fetch one-page-at-a-time.

     --read-time=READ_TIME
        (DEPRECATED) Time used as a reference point when filtering. Absence of
        this field will default to the API's version of NOW. See $ gcloud topic
        datetimes for information on supported time formats.

        The --read-time option is deprecated. For more information, [see the
        deprecation notice]
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/release-notes#April_15_2024)
        on the SCC release notes page.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
