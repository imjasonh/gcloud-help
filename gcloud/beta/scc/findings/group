    gcloud beta scc findings group - filter an organization or source's
        findings and groups them by their specified properties

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta scc findings group [PARENT]
        [--compare-duration=COMPARE_DURATION] [--filter=FILTER]
        [--group-by=GROUP_BY] [--location=LOCATION; default="global"]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--page-token=PAGE_TOKEN]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) To group across all sources provide a '-' as the source id.

EXAMPLES
    Group findings under organization 123456 across all sources by their
    category:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings group 123456 --group-by="category"

    Group findings under project example-project across all sources by their
    category:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings group projects/example-project \
            --group-by="category"

    Group findings under folders 456 across all sources by their category:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings group folders/456 --group-by="category"

    Group findings under organization 123456 and source 5678, by their
    category:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings group 123456 --source=5678 \
            --group-by="category"

    Group ACTIVE findings under organization 123456 and source 5678, by their
    category:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings group 123456 --source=5678 \
            --group-by="category" --filter="state=\"ACTIVE\""

    Group findings under organization 123456 and location=eu across all sources
    by their category:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings group 123456 --group-by="category" \
            --location=eu

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Parent resource - parent organization, folder, or project in the Google
     Cloud resource hierarchy to be used for the gcloud scc command. Specify
     the argument as either [RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_ID] or [RESOURCE_ID], as
     shown in the preceding examples. This represents a Cloud resource.

       [PARENT]
          ID of the parent or fully qualified identifier for the parent.

          To set the parent attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument parent on the command line;
          ▸ Set the parent property in configuration using gcloud config set
            scc/parent if it is not specified in command line.

FLAGS
     --compare-duration=COMPARE_DURATION
        (DEPRECATED) When compare_duration is set, the result's "state_change"
        attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had its state
        changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or if the finding was
        added during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the
        read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and
        read_time. The state_change value is derived based on the presence and
        state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate state
        changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the
        results aren't affected if the finding is made inactive and then active
        again. Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is
        specified:

        ◆ 'CHANGED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of
          compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time.

        ◆ 'UNCHANGED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of
          compare_duration and did not change state at read_time.

        ◆ 'ADDED': indicates that the finding was not present at the start of
          compare_duration, but was present at read_time.

        ◆ 'REMOVED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of
          compare_duration, but was not present at read_time.

            If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible
            state_change is 'UNUSED', which will be the state_change set for all
            findings present at read_time. If this field is set then 'state_change'
            must be a specified field in 'group_by'. See $ gcloud topic datetimes
            for information on supported duration formats.

        The --compare-duration option is deprecated. For more information, [see
        the deprecation notice]
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/release-notes#April_15_2024)
        on the SCC release notes page.

     --filter=FILTER
        Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The
        expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
        operators 'AND' and 'OR'. Parentheses are supported, and 'OR' has
        higher precedence than 'AND'. Restrictions have the form '<field>
        <operator> <value>' and may have a '-' character in front of them to
        indicate negation. Examples include: name,
        source_properties.a_property, security_marks.marks.marka. The supported
        operators are:
        ◆ '=' for all value types.
        ◆ '>', '<', '>=', '<=' for integer values.
        ◆ ':', meaning substring matching, for strings.

        The supported value types are:string literals in quotes, integer
        literals without quotes, boolean literals 'true' and 'false' without
        quotes. Some example filters: 'source_properties.size = 100',
        'category=\"XSS\" AND event_time > 10' etc.

     --group-by=GROUP_BY
        Expression that defines what findings fields to use for grouping
        (including 'state'). String value should follow SQL syntax: comma
        separated list of fields. For example: "parent,resource_name". The
        following fields are supported:
        ◆ resource_name
        ◆ category
        ◆ state
        ◆ parent

     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the
        location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location
        attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name
        or with the --location argument on the command line. The default
        location is global.

        The default location on this command is unrelated to the default
        location that is specified when data residency controls are enabled for
        Security Command Center.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Maximum number of results to return in a single response. Default is
        10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        Response objects will return a non-null value for page-token to
        indicate that there is at least one additional page of data. User can
        either directly request that page by specifying the page-token
        explicitly or let gcloud fetch one-page-at-a-time.

     --read-time=READ_TIME
        (DEPRECATED) Time used as a reference point when filtering. Absence of
        this field will default to the API's version of NOW. See $ gcloud topic
        datetimes for information on supported time formats.

        The --read-time option is deprecated. For more information, [see the
        deprecation notice]
        (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/release-notes#April_15_2024)
        on the SCC release notes page.

     --source=SOURCE; default="-"
        Source id. Defaults to all sources.
