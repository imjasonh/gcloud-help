        finding

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta scc findings update
        (FINDING : --organization=ORGANIZATION --source=SOURCE)
        [--event-time=EVENT_TIME] [--external-uri=EXTERNAL_URI]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update a Cloud Security Command Center finding.

EXAMPLES
    Update my-finding's state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings update my-finding --organization=123456 \
            --source=5678 --state=INACTIVE

    Update my-finding's state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE using project name for
    example-project:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings update \
            projects/example-project/sources/5678/findings/my-finding \
            --state=INACTIVE

    Update my-finding's state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE using folder name 456:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings update \
            folders/456/sources/5678/findings/my-finding --state=INACTIVE

    Override all source properties on my-finding:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings update my-finding --organization=123456 \
            --source=5678 \
            --source-properties="propKey1=propVal1,propKey2=propVal2"

    Selectively update a specific source property on my-finding:

        $ gcloud beta scc findings update my-finding --organization=123456 \
            --source=5678 \
            --source-properties="propKey1=propVal1,propKey2=propVal2" \
            --update-mask="source_properties.propKey1"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Finding resource - The finding to be used for the SCC (Security Command
     Center) command. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource.

     This must be specified.

       FINDING
          ID of the finding or fully qualified identifier for the finding. To
          set the finding attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument finding on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123, then provide the organization id which is the
          suffix of the organization. Example: organizations/123, the id is
          123.

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument finding on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --organization on the command line;
          ▸ Set the organization property in configuration using gcloud
            config set scc/organization if it is not specified in command
            line..

       --source=SOURCE
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123/sources/456, then provide the source id which is
          the suffix of the source. Example: organizations/123/sources/456, the
          id is 456.

          To set the source attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument finding on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --source on the command line.

FLAGS
     --event-time=EVENT_TIME
        Time at which the event took place. For example, if the finding
        represents an open firewall it would capture the time the open firewall
        was detected. If event-time is not provided, it will default to UTC
        version of NOW. For example 2019-02-28T07:00:00Z

     --external-uri=EXTERNAL_URI
        URI that, if available, points to a web page outside of Cloud SCC
        (Security Command Center) where additional information about the
        finding can be found. This field is guaranteed to be either empty or a
        well formed URL.

     --source-properties=[SOURCE_PROPERTIES,...]
        Source specific properties. These properties are managed by the source
        that writes the finding. The key names in the source_properties map
        must be between 1 and 255 characters, and must start with a letter and
        contain alphanumeric characters or underscores only. For example
        "key1=val1,key2=val2"

     --state=STATE
        State is one of: [ACTIVE, INACTIVE]. STATE must be one of: active,
        inactive, state-unspecified.

     --update-mask=UPDATE_MASK
        Optional: If left unspecified (default), an update-mask is
        automatically created using the flags specified in the command and only
        those values are updated. For example: --external-uri='<some-uri>'
        --event-time='<some-time>' would automatically generate
        --update-mask='external_uri,event_time'. Note that as a result, only
        external-uri and event-time are updated for the given finding and
        everything else remains untouched. If you want to delete
        attributes/properties (that are not being changed in the update
        command) use an empty update-mask (''). That will delete all the
        mutable properties/attributes that aren't specified as flags in the
        update command. In the above example it would delete source-properties.
        State can be toggled from ACTIVE to INACTIVE and vice-versa but it
        cannot be deleted.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
