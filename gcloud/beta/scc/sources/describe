     Command Center) command. This represents a Cloud resource.

       [ORGANIZATION]
          ID of the organization or fully qualified identifier for the
          organization. To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument organization on the command line;
          ▸ Set the organization property in configuration using gcloud
            config set scc/organization if it is not specified in command
            line..

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --source=SOURCE
          Cloud SCC specific source. It's derived from the the source's
          relative resource name. See:
          https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name.
          For Example: For the given source name:
          "organizations/123/sources/456", 456 represents source id.

       --source-display-name=SOURCE_DISPLAY_NAME
          Source's display name must be unique amongst its siblings, for
          example, two sources with the same parent can't share the same
          display name. Display name must start and end with a letter or digit,
          may contain letters, digits, spaces, hyphens, and underscores, and
          can be no longer than 32 characters. This is captured by the regular
          expression: [\p{L}\p{N}]({\p{L}\p{N}- ]{0,30}[\p{L}\p{N}])?. For
          example: 'Cloud Security Scanner' is the source display name.
