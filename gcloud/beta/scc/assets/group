    gcloud beta scc assets group - filter an organization's assets and groups
        them by their specified properties

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta scc assets group [PARENT] [--compare-duration=COMPARE_DURATION]
        [--filter=FILTER] [--group-by=GROUP_BY] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Filter an organization's assets and groups them by their specified
    properties.

EXAMPLES
    Group assets under organization 123456 by their type (e.g. project, disk,
    compute instance, service etc):

        $ gcloud beta scc assets group 123456 \
            --group-by="security_center_properties.resource_type"

    Group assets under project example-project by their type (e.g. project,
    disk, compute instance, service etc):

        $ gcloud beta scc assets group projects/example-project \
            --group-by="security_center_properties.resource_type"

    Group assets under folder 456 by their type (e.g. project, disk, compute
    instance, service etc):

        $ gcloud beta scc assets group folders/456 \
            --group-by="security_center_properties.resource_type"

    Group compute instances (assets) under organization 123456 by their
    respective projects:

        $ gcloud beta scc assets group 123456 \
            --filter="security_center_properties.resource_type=\"google.comp\
        ute.Instance\"" \
        --group-by="security_center_properties.resource_project"

    Group assets that were updated on or after 2019-01-01T01:00:00 GMT by their
    types.

        $ gcloud beta scc assets group 123456 \
            --filter="update_time >= 1546304400000" \
            --group-by="security_center_properties.resource_type"

    Group assets into following 3 state_changes (ADDED/DELETED/ACTIVE) based on
    the activity during past 24 hours:

        $ gcloud beta scc assets group 123456 --compare-duration=86400s \
            --group-by="state_change"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Parent resource - parent organization, folder, or project in the Google
     Cloud resource hierarchy to be used for the gcloud scc command. Specify
     the argument as either [RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_ID] or [RESOURCE_ID], as
     shown in the preceding examples. This represents a Cloud resource.

       [PARENT]
          ID of the parent or fully qualified identifier for the parent.

          To set the parent attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument parent on the command line;
          ▸ Set the parent property in configuration using gcloud config set
            scc/parent if it is not specified in command line.

FLAGS
     --compare-duration=COMPARE_DURATION
        GroupAssetsResult's "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate
        whether the asset was added, removed, or remained present during the
        compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time. Example
        duration: "100000s"

     --filter=FILTER
        Expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
        operators 'AND' and 'OR'. Parentheses are not supported, and 'OR' has
        higher precedence than 'AND'. For example, 'update_time > 100 AND
        security_center_properties.resource_type=\"google.cloud.resourcemanager.Organization\"'
        is a valid filter string.

     --group-by=GROUP_BY
        Expression that defines what asset fields to use for grouping
        (including 'state'). String value should follow SQL syntax: comma
        separated list of fields. For example: "parent,resource_name". The
        following fields are supported:
        ◆ security_center_properties.resource_project
        ◆ security_center_properties.resource_type
        ◆ security_center_properties.resource_parent
        ◆ state_change

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        The maximum number of results to return in a single response. Default
        is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        Value returned by the last 'GroupAssetsResponse'; indicates that this
        is a continuation of a prior 'GroupAssets' call, and that the system
        should return the next page of data.

     --read-time=READ_TIME
        Time used as a reference point when filtering assets. Filter is limited
        to assets existing at the supplied time and their values are those at
        that specific time. For example: 2019-02-28T07:00:00Z. Absence of this
        field will default to the API's version of NOW.
