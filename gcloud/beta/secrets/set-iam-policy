SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta secrets set-iam-policy SECRET POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Sets the IAM policy for the given secret as defined in a JSON or
    YAML file.

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for the secret 'my-secret':

        $ gcloud beta secrets set-iam-policy my-secret policy.json

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Secret resource - Name of the secret for which to set the IAM policy. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument secret on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       SECRET
          ID of the secret or fully qualified identifier for the secret. To set
          the secret attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument secret on the command line.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
