         nfs-export-options
            The NfsExportOptions for the Cloud Filestore instance file share.
            Configuring NfsExportOptions is optional and can only be set using
            flags-file. Use the --flags-file flag to specify the path to a JSON
            or YAML configuration file that contains the required
            NfsExportOptions flags.

         ip-ranges
            A list of IPv4 addresses or CIDR ranges that are allowed to mount
            the file share. IPv4 addresses format: {octet 1}.{octet 2}.{octet
            3}.{octet 4}. CIDR range format: {octet 1}.{octet 2}.{octet
            3}.{octet 4}/{mask size}. Overlapping IP ranges are allowed for all
            tiers other than BASIC_HDD and BASIC_SSD. The limit of IP
            ranges/addresses for each FileShareConfig among all
            NfsExportOptions is 64 per instance.

         access-mode
            The type of access allowed for the specified IP-addresses or CIDR
            ranges. READ_ONLY: Allows only read requests on the exported file
            share. READ_WRITE: Allows both read and write requests on the
            exported file share. The default setting is READ_WRITE.

         squash-mode
            Enables or disables root squash for the specified IP addresses or
            CIDR ranges. NO_ROOT_SQUASH: Disables root squash to allow root
            access on the exported file share. ROOT_SQUASH. Enables root squash
            to remove root access on the exported file share. The default
            setting is NO_ROOT_SQUASH.

         anon_uid
            An integer that represents the user ID of anonymous users. Anon_uid
            may only be set when squash_mode is set to ROOT_SQUASH. If
            NO_ROOT_SQUASH is specified, an error will be returned. The default
            value is 65534.

         anon_gid
            An integer that represents the group ID of anonymous groups.
            Anon_gid may only be set when squash_mode is set to ROOT_SQUASH. If
            NO_ROOT_SQUASH is specified, an error will be returned. The default
            value is 65534.

         security-flavors
            A list of security flavors that are allowed to be used during mount
            command in NFSv4.1 filestore instances. The security flavors
            supported are:
              ▫ SECURITY_FLAVOR_UNSPECIFIED: SecurityFlavor not set. Defaults
                to AUTH_SYS.
              ▫ AUTH_SYS: The user's UNIX user-id and group-ids are passed in
                the clear.
              ▫ KRB5: The end-user authentication is done using Kerberos V5.
              ▫ KRB5I: KRB5 plus integrity protection (data packets are
                tamper proof).
              ▫ KRB5P: KRB5I plus privacy protection (data packets are tamper
                proof and encrypted).

         source-backup
            The name of the backup to restore from.

         source-backup-region
            The region of the source backup.

     --network=[connect-mode=CONNECT-MODE],[name=NAME],[reserved-ip-range=RESERVED-IP-RANGE]
        Network configuration for a Cloud Filestore instance. Specifying
        reserved-ip-range and connect-mode is optional.
         name
            The name of the Google Compute Engine VPC network to which the
            instance is connected.
         reserved-ip-range
            The reserved-ip-range can have one of the following two types of
            values: a CIDR range value when using DIRECT_PEERING connect mode
            or an allocated IP address range
            (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-internal-ip-address)
            when using PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS connect mode. When the name of an
            allocated IP address range is specified, it must be one of the
            ranges associated with the private service access connection. When
            specified as a direct CIDR value, it must be a /29 CIDR block for
            Basic tier or a /24 CIDR block for High Scale, Zonal, Enterprise or
            Regional tier in one of the internal IP address ranges
            (https://www.arin.net/knowledge/address_filters.html) that
            identifies the range of IP addresses reserved for this instance.
            For example, 10.0.0.0/29 or 192.168.0.0/24. The range you specify
            can't overlap with either existing subnets or assigned IP address
            ranges for other Cloud Filestore instances in the selected VPC
            network.
         connect-mode
            Network connection mode used by instances. CONNECT_MODE must be one
            of: DIRECT_PEERING or PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS.

OPTIONAL FLAGS

        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A description of the Cloud Filestore instance.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the Cloud Filestore instance/operation.

     --managed-ad=[computer=COMPUTER],[domain=DOMAIN]
        Managed Active Directory configuration for an instance. Specifies both
        the domain name and a computer name (unique to the domain) to be
        created by the filestore instance.

            domain
               The desired domain full uri. i.e:
               projects/PROJECT/locations/global/domains/DOMAIN

            computer
               The desired active directory computer name to be created by
               the filestore instance when connecting to the domain.

     --performance=[iops-by-capacity],[max-read-iops=MAX-READ-IOPS],[max-read-iops-per-gb=MAX-READ-IOPS-PER-GB]
        Performance configuration for the instance. This flag is used to
        configure the read IOPS provisioned for the instance. The instance's
        write IOPS and read/write throughputs will be derived from the
        configured read IOPS. For more information about the derived
        performance limits see
        https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/performance. Must be one of:

            iops-by-capacity
              Default configuration. Automatically provisions the instance IOPS
              based on its capacity. If the user changes the instance capacity,
              IOPS will be automatically adjusted accordingly. The available IOPS
              for a given capacity can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/performance.

            max-read-iops
              The number of IOPS to provision for the instance.
              MAX-READ-IOPS must be in multiple of 1000 and in the supported IOPS
              range for the current capacity of the instance.
              For more details, see: https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/performance.

            max-read-iops-per-gb
              Is used for setting the max IOPS of the instance by
              specifying the IOPS per GB. When this parameter is used, the
              max IOPS are derived from the instance capacity:
              The instance max IOPS will be calculated by multiplying the
              capacity of the instance (GB) by MAX-READ-IOPS-PER-GB, and rounding
              to the nearest 1000. The max IOPS will be changed
              dynamically based on the instance capacity.
              MAX-READ-IOPS-PER-GB must be in the supported range of the instance.
              For more details, see: https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/performance.

        Examples:

        Configure an instance implicitly with iops_by_capacity performance:

            $ gcloud beta filestore instances create example-cluster

        Configure an instance explicitly with iops_by_capacity performance:

                --performance=max-read-iops=1000

        Configure an instance with max-read-iops-per-gb performance:

            $ gcloud beta filestore instances create example-cluster \
                --performance=max-read-iops-per-gb=5

     --protocol=PROTOCOL; default="NFS_V3"
