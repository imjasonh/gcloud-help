NAME
    gcloud beta projects - create and manage project access policies

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta projects COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) The gcloud beta projects group lets you create and manage IAM
    policies for projects on the Google Cloud Platform. Resources are organized
    hierarchically and assigned to a particular project. A Project resource is
    required to use Google Cloud Platform, and forms the basis for creating,
    enabling and using all Cloud Platform services, managing APIs, enabling
    billing, adding and removing collaborators, and managing permissions.

    More information on the Cloud Platform Resource Hierarchy and the project
    resource can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization
    and detailed documentation on creating and managing projects can be found
