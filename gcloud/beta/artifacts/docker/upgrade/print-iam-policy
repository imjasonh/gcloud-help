NAME
    gcloud beta artifacts docker upgrade print-iam-policy - print an Artifact
        Registry IAM policy for Container Registry to Artifact Registry upgrade

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta artifacts docker upgrade print-iam-policy DOMAIN
        [--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Print an Artifact Registry IAM policy that is equivalent to the IAM
    policy applied to the storage bucket for the specified Container Registry
    hostname. Apply the returned policy to the Artifact Registry repository
    that will replace the specified host. By default, this command only
    considers IAM policies within the project-level scope, so policies that are
    at the folder or organization level will not be included in the generated
    policy. To change the scope, use the --organization or --folder flags.

EXAMPLES
    To print an equivalant Artifact Registry IAM policy for 'gcr.io/my-project'
    within scope projects/my-project:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts docker upgrade print-iam-policy upgrade \
          print-iam-policy gcr.io --project=my-project

    To print an equivalant Artifact Registry IAM policy for 'gcr.io/my-project'
    within scope folders/123:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts docker upgrade print-iam-policy upgrade \
          print-iam-policy gcr.io --project=my-project --folder=123

    To print an equivalant Artifact Registry IAM policy for 'gcr.io/my-project'
    within scope organizations/123:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts docker upgrade print-iam-policy upgrade \
          print-iam-policy gcr.io --project=my-project --organization=123

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DOMAIN

          below this folder will be included in the analysis.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization ID on which to scope IAM analysis. Only policies defined
          at or below this organization will be included in the analysis.
