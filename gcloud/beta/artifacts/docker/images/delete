NAME
    gcloud beta artifacts docker images delete - delete an Artifact Registry
        container image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta artifacts docker images delete IMAGE [--async] [--delete-tags]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) A valid container image has the format of

        LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY-ID/IMAGE

    A valid container image that can be referenced by tag or digest, has the
    format of

        LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY-ID/IMAGE:tag
        LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY-ID/IMAGE@sha256:digest

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ Trying to delete an image by digest when the image is still tagged.
        Add --delete-tags to delete the digest and the tags.
      ▪ Trying to delete an image by tag when the image has other tags. Add
        --delete-tags to delete all tags.
      ▪ A valid repository format was not provided.
      ▪ The specified image does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to delete images.

EXAMPLES
    To delete image busy-box in us-west1 and all of its digests and tags:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts docker images delete \
          us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repository/busy-box

    To delete image digest abcxyz under image busy-box:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts docker images delete \
          us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repository/\
        busy-box@sha256:abcxyz

    To delete image digest abcxyz under image busy-box while there're other
    tags associate with the digest:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts docker images delete \
          us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repository/\
        busy-box@sha256:abcxyz --delete-tags

    To delete an image digest and its only tag my-tag under image busy-box:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts docker images delete \
          us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repository/busy-box:my-tag
