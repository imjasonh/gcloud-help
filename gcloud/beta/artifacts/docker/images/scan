NAME
    gcloud beta artifacts docker images scan - perform a vulnerability scan on
        a container image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta artifacts docker images scan RESOURCE_URI
        [--additional-package-types=[ADDITIONAL_PACKAGE_TYPES,...]] [--async]
        [--location=LOCATION; default="us"] [--remote]
        [--skip-package-types=[SKIP_PACKAGE_TYPES,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) You can scan a container image in a Google Cloud registry (Artifact
    Registry or Container Registry), or a local container image.

    Reference an image by tag or digest using any of the formats:

        Artifact Registry:
          LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY-ID/IMAGE[:tag]
          LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY-ID/IMAGE@sha256:digest

        Container Registry:
          [LOCATION.]gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY-ID/IMAGE[:tag]
          [LOCATION.]gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY-ID/IMAGE@sha256:digest

        Local:
          IMAGE[:tag]

EXAMPLES
    Start a scan of a container image stored in Artifact Registry:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts docker images scan \
          us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repository/\
        busy-box@sha256:abcxyz --remote

    Start a scan of a container image stored in the Container Registry, and
    perform the analysis in Europe:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts docker images scan \
          eu.gcr.io/my-project/my-repository/my-image:latest --remote \
          --location=europe

    Start a scan of a container image stored locally, and perform the analysis
    in Asia:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts docker images scan ubuntu:latest \
          --location=asia

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RESOURCE_URI
        A container image in a Google Cloud registry (Artifact Registry or
        Container Registry), or a local container image.

FLAGS
     --additional-package-types=[ADDITIONAL_PACKAGE_TYPES,...]
        (DEPRECATED) A comma-separated list of package types to scan in
        addition to OS packages.

        This flag is deprecated as scanning for all package types is now the
        default. To skip scanning for specific package types, use
        --skip-package-types. ADDITIONAL_PACKAGE_TYPES must be one of:

         COMPOSER
            PHP Composer package.
         GO
            Go standard library and third party packages.
         MAVEN
            Maven package.
         NPM
            NPM package.
         NUGET
            NuGet package.
         PYTHON
            Python package.
         RUBYGEMS
            RubyGems package.
         RUST
            Rust package.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --location=LOCATION; default="us"
        The API location in which to perform package analysis. Consider
        choosing a location closest to where you are located. Proximity to the
        container image does not affect response time. LOCATION must be one of:

         asia
            Perform analysis in Asia
         europe
            Perform analysis in Europe
         us
            Perform analysis in the US

     --remote
        Whether the container image is located remotely or on your local
        machine.

     --skip-package-types=[SKIP_PACKAGE_TYPES,...]
        A comma-separated list of package types to skip when scanning.
        SKIP_PACKAGE_TYPES must be one of:

         COMPOSER
            PHP Composer package.
         GO
            Go standard library and third party packages.
         MAVEN
            Maven package.
         NPM
            NPM package.

            Rust package.
