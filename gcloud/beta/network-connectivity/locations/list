NAME
    gcloud beta network-connectivity locations list - list Network Connectivity
        Center locations

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta network-connectivity locations list [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Retrieve and display a list of locations.

    Network Connectivity Center includes two general types of spokes: those
    that use the site-to-site data transfer feature and those that don't. To
    get a list of the locations that support one of these features, use the
    --filter flag (see examples). The full list of location features can be
    found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/reference/networkconnectivity/rest/Shared.Types/LocationFeature

    To specify the maximum number of locations to return, use the --limit flag.

EXAMPLES
    To list all locations, run:

        $ gcloud beta network-connectivity locations list

    To list locations that support the site-to-site data transfer feature, run:

        $ gcloud beta network-connectivity locations list \
            --filter="metadata.locationFeatures=SITE_TO_SITE_SPOKES"

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
