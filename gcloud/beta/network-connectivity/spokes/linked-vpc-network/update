     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument spoke on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     To set the location attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument spoke on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --global on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       SPOKE
          ID of the spoke or fully qualified identifier for the spoke.

          To set the spoke attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument spoke on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        New description of the spoke.

     --global
        Indicates that the spoke is global.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud beta network-connectivity spokes linked-vpc-network \
                update --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud beta network-connectivity spokes linked-vpc-network \
                update --clear-labels --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.
