NAME
    gcloud beta network-services service-lb-policies update - update a service
        LB policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta network-services service-lb-policies update
        (SERVICE_LB_POLICY : --location=LOCATION) [--async]
        [--auto-capacity-drain] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--failover-health-threshold=FAILOVER_HEALTH_THRESHOLD]
        [--load-balancing-algorithm=LOAD_BALANCING_ALGORITHM;
          default="waterfall-by-region"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update the detail of a service LB Policy.

EXAMPLES
    Update load-balancing-algorithm of a service LB policy named
    my-service-lb-policy:

        $ gcloud beta network-services service-lb-policies update \
            my-service-lb-policy \
            --load-balancing-algorithm=waterfall-by-zone

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service lb policy resource - Name of the service LB policy to be updated.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument service_lb_policy on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SERVICE_LB_POLICY
          ID of the service lb policy or fully qualified identifier for the
          service lb policy.

          To set the service_lb_policy attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument service_lb_policy on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location Id.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument service_lb_policy on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --auto-capacity-drain
        If specified, an unhealthy MIG/NEG will be removed from Global load
        balancing and traffic routing for the service. A MIG/NEG is considered
        to be unhealthy if less than 25% of the instance/endpoints in the
        MIG/NEG are healthy. autoCapacityDrain will never drain more than 50%
        of the configured MIGs/NEGs of a Backend Service.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        The description for the service LB policy.

     --failover-health-threshold=FAILOVER_HEALTH_THRESHOLD
        The percentage threshold that a load balancer will begin to send
        traffic to failover backends. If the percentage of endpoints in a
        MIG/NEG is smaller than this value, traffic would be sent to failover
        backends if possible. This field should be set to a value between 1 and
        99. The default value is 50 for Proxyless service mesh, and 70 for
        others.

     --load-balancing-algorithm=LOAD_BALANCING_ALGORITHM; default="waterfall-by-region"
        The global load balancing algorithm to be used.
        LOAD_BALANCING_ALGORITHM must be one of:

         spray-to-region
            Spread the traffic from each client to all the MIGs/NEGs in a
            region.

         spray-to-world
            Balance traffic across all backends across the world proportionally
            based on capacity.

         waterfall-by-region
            Direct traffic to the nearest region with endpoints and capacity
            before spilling over to other regions.

         waterfall-by-zone
            Attempt to keep traffic in a single zone closest to the client,
            before spilling over to other zones.
