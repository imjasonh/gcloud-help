NAME
    gcloud beta managed-kafka topics create - create a Managed Service for
        Apache Kafka topic

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta managed-kafka topics create
        (TOPIC : --cluster=CLUSTER --location=LOCATION) --partitions=PARTITIONS
        --replication-factor=REPLICATION_FACTOR [--configs=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a Managed Service for Apache Kafka topic.

EXAMPLES
    To create a topic in a cluster named mycluster located in us-central1, run
    the following:

        $ gcloud beta managed-kafka topics create mytopic \
            --cluster=mycluster --location=us-central1 --partitions=1 \
            --replication-factor=3

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Topic resource - Identifies the name of the topic that this command
     creates. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument topic on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       TOPIC
          ID of the topic or fully qualified identifier for the topic.

          To set the topic attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument topic on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --cluster=CLUSTER
          The cluster name.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument topic on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --cluster on the command line.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location of the Managed Service for Apache Kafka resource.
          See
          https://cloud.google.com/managed-service-for-apache-kafka/docs/locations
          for a list of supported locations.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument topic on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --partitions=PARTITIONS
        The number of partitions in a topic. You can increase the partition
        count for a topic, but you cannot decrease it. Increasing partitions
        for a topic that uses a key might change how messages are distributed.

     --replication-factor=REPLICATION_FACTOR
        The number of replicas of each partition. A replication factor of 3 is
        recommended for high availability.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --configs=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Configuration for the topic that are overridden from the cluster
        defaults. The key of the map is a Kafka topic property name, for
        example: cleanup.policy=compact,compression.type=producer. If you
        provide a map with a key that already exists, only that configuration
        is updated. If the map contains a key that does not exist, the entry is
        appended to the topic configuration.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
