NAME
    gcloud beta managed-kafka topics update - update an Apache Kafka for
        BigQuery topic

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta managed-kafka topics update
        (TOPIC : --cluster=CLUSTER --location=LOCATION)
        (--configs=[KEY=VALUE,...] --partitions=PARTITIONS)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update an Apache Kafka for BigQuery topic.

EXAMPLES
    To update an attribute in a topic, such as the partitions, for a cluster
    named mycluster located in us-central1, run the following:

        $ gcloud beta managed-kafka topics update mytopic \
            --cluster=mycluster --location=us-central1 --partitions=3

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Topic resource - Identifies the topic to be updated. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument topic on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       TOPIC
          ID of the topic or fully qualified identifier for the topic.

          To set the topic attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument topic on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --cluster=CLUSTER
          The cluster name.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument topic on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --cluster on the command line.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location of the Apache Kafka for BigQuery resource. See
          https://cloud.google.com/managed-kafka/docs/locations for a list of
          supported locations.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument topic on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     At least one of these must be specified:

       --configs=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Configuration for the topic that are overridden from the cluster
          defaults. The key of the map is a Kafka topic property name, for
          example: cleanup.policy=compact,compression.type=producer. If you
          provide a map with a key that already exists, only that configuration
          is updated. If the map contains a key that does not exist, the entry
          is appended to the topic configuration.

       --partitions=PARTITIONS
          The number of partitions in a topic. You can increase the partition
          count for a topic, but you cannot decrease it. Increasing partitions
          for a topic that uses a key might change how messages are
          distributed.

    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
