NAME
    gcloud beta services list - list services for a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta services list [--available | --enabled] [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE; default=200]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command lists the services that are enabled or available to be
    enabled by a project. You can choose the mode in which the command will
    list services by using exactly one of the --enabled or --available flags.
    --enabled is the default.

EXAMPLES
    To list the services the current project has enabled for consumption, run:

        $ gcloud beta services list --enabled

    To list the services the current project can enable for consumption, run:

        $ gcloud beta services list --available

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --available
          Return the services available to the project to enable. This list
          will include any services that the project has already enabled.

       --enabled
          (DEFAULT) Return the services which the project has enabled.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE; default=200
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is 200.
        Paging may be applied before or after --filter and --limit depending on
        the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
