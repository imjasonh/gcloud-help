SYNOPSIS

        [--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID

        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE; default=50] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) List members of a specific service and group.

EXAMPLES
    List members of service my-service and group my-group:

        $ gcloud beta services groups list-members my-service my-group

    List members of service my-service and group my-group for a specific
    project '12345678':

        $ gcloud beta services groups list-members my-service my-group \
             --project=12345678

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE
        Name of the service.

     GROUP
        Service group name, for example "dependencies".

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform folder ID to use for this invocation.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform organization ID to use for this invocation.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE; default=50
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is 50.
        Paging may be applied before or after --filter and --limit depending on
        the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha services groups list-members
