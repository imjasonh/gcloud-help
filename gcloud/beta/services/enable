DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command enables a service for consumption for a project, folder
    or organization.

        To see a list of available services for a project, run:

        $ gcloud beta services list --available

    More information on listing services can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/list-services and on disabling
    a service at: https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable

EXAMPLES
    To enable a service called my-consumed-service on the current project, run:

        $ gcloud beta services enable my-consumed-service

    To enable a service called my-consumed-service on the project my-project,
    run:

        $ gcloud beta services enable my-consumed-service \
            --project=my-project

    To enable a service called my-consumed-service on the folder my-folder,
    run:

        $ gcloud beta services enable my-consumed-service --folder=my-folder

    To enable a service called my-consumed-service on the organization
    my-organization, run:

        $ gcloud beta services enable my-consumed-service \
            --organization=my-organization

    To run the same command asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud beta services enable my-consumed-service --async

    To enable services called service1, service2, and service3 on the current
    project, run:

        $ gcloud beta services enable service1 service2 service3

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE [SERVICE ...]
        The name of the service(s) to enable.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --skip-dependency
        If set, the dependencies of the service to be enabled will not be
        enabled.

     --validate-only
        Validate the enable action, but don't actually perform it

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform folder ID to use for this invocation.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform organization ID to use for this invocation.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
