NAME
    gcloud beta services policies get-effective - get effective policy for a
        project, folder or organization

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta services policies get-effective [--view=VIEW; default="BASIC"]
        [--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Get effective policy for a project, folder or organization.

EXAMPLES
    Get effective policy for the current project:

        $ gcloud beta services policies get-effective

    Get effective policy for project my-project:

        $ gcloud beta services policies get-effective --project=my-project

FLAGS
     --view=VIEW; default="BASIC"
        The view of the effective policy. BASIC includes basic metadata about
        the effective policy. FULL includes every information related to
        effective policy. VIEW must be one of: BASIC, FULL.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform folder ID to use for this invocation.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform organization ID to use for this invocation.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
