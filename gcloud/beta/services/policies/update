SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta services policies update

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update consumer policy for a project, folder or organization.

EXAMPLES
    Update consumer policy

        $ gcloud beta services policies update \
             --consumer-policy-file=/path/to/the/file.yaml

    Validate the update action on the policy:

        $ gcloud beta services policies update \
             --consumer-policy-file=/path/to/the/file.yaml --validate-only

    Update consumer policy and bypass dependency check:

        $ gcloud beta services policies update \
             --consumer-policy-file=/path/to/the/file.yaml \
             --bypass-dependency-check

    Update consumer policy and bypass api usage check:

        $ gcloud beta services policies update \
             --consumer-policy-file=/path/to/the/file.yaml \
             --bypass-api-usage-check

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --consumer-policy-file=CONSUMER_POLICY_FILE
        Path to the file that contains the consumer policy in the YAML format.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --bypass-api-usage-check
        If true, the system will bypass usage checks for services that are
        being removed. If false, the system will check if the service to be
        removed was used in the last 30 days or enabled in the last 3 days. If
        so, an error will be returned.

     --bypass-dependency-check
        This flag controls dependency management within the consumer policy. If
        false, dependencies are enforced. When adding a new service, it
        verifies that all the services dependencies are already present in the
        policy. When removing a service, the system will ensure that no other
        services in the policy depend on it. If the policy lacks any required
        dependencies, the update will not succeed, and an error will be
        returned.

     --validate-only
        Validate the to update action, but don't actually perform it

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
