NAME
    gcloud beta services vpc-peerings disable-vpc-service-controls - disable
        VPC Service Controls for the peering connection

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta services vpc-peerings disable-vpc-service-controls
        --network=NETWORK [--async]
        [--service=SERVICE; default="servicenetworking.googleapis.com"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command disables VPC Service Controls for the peering
    connection.

    The local default route (destination 0.0.0.0/0, next hop default internet
    gateway) is recreated in the service producer VPC network. After the route
    is recreated, the service producer VPC network cannot import a custom
    default route from the peering connection to the customer VPC network.

EXAMPLES
    To disable VPC Service Controls for a connection peering a network called
    my-network on the current project to a service called your-service, run:

        $ gcloud beta services vpc-peerings disable-vpc-service-controls \
            --network=my-network --service=your-service

    To run the same command asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud beta services vpc-peerings disable-vpc-service-controls \
            --network=my-network --service=your-service --async

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The network in the current project that is peered with the service.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --service=SERVICE; default="servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
        The service to enable VPC service controls for.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
