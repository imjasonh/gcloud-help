NAME
    gcloud beta active-directory peerings create - create a Managed Microsoft
        Active Directory domain peering

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta active-directory peerings create PEERING
        --authorized-network=AUTHORIZED_NETWORK --domain=DOMAIN [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a new Managed Microsoft AD domain peering with the given name
    using Google Cloud's Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ A domain peering with the same name already exists.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to create AD domains
        peerings.
      ▪ There is an overlap between the provided CIDR range and authorized
        network's CIDR.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates an AD domain peering with the name
    my-peering, network my-network and domain
    projects/domain-project/locations/global/domains/domain.com

        $ gcloud beta active-directory peerings create my-peering \
            --domain=projects/domain-project/locations/global/domains/\
        domain.com \
            --authorized-network=projects/network-project/global/networks/\
        my-network
