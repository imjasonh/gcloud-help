        LDAPS settings of a Managed Microsoft AD domain

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Describe the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol over TLS/SSL
    (LDAPS) settings of a Managed Microsoft AD domain.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The domain specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to view LDAPS settings
        for the domain.

EXAMPLES
    The following command shows the LDAPS settings for an AD domain with the
    name my-domain.com.

        $ gcloud beta active-directory domains describe-ldaps-settings \
            my-domain.com
