        Active Directory Trust between a Managed Microsoft AD domain and
        another domain

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta active-directory domains trusts create DOMAIN
        --target-dns-ip-addresses=[TARGET_DNS_IP_ADDRESSES,...]
        --target-domain-name=TARGET_DOMAIN_NAME [--async]
        [--direction=DIRECTION; default="BIDIRECTIONAL"]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a Microsoft Active Directory Trust between a Managed
    Microsoft AD domain and another domain.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The domain specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access the given
        domain.
      ▪ A trust already exists with the same target domain name.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to create AD trusts.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates an external, bidirectional AD trust between
    my-domain.com and target-domain.com.

        $ gcloud beta active-directory domains trusts create my-domain.com \
            --target-domain-name=target-domain.com \
            --target-dns-ip-addresses=10.177.0.2 --type=EXTERNAL \
            --direction=BIDIRECTIONAL --selective-authentication=false \
            --async

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument domain on the command line with a fully

     This must be specified.

     --target-domain-name=TARGET_DOMAIN_NAME
        Target domain name for the Managed Microsoft AD Trust.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
