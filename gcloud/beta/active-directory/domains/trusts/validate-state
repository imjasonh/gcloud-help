DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Validate the state of a Managed Microsoft AD trust.

    Verify that the trust has been properly created and that the
    domains/forests can communicate with each other.

        domain.
      ▪ The AD trust specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access the given AD
        trust.

EXAMPLES
    The following command validates state for an AD trust with the given target
    domain name my-target-domain.com.

        $ gcloud beta active-directory domains trusts validate-state \
            my-domain.com --target-domain-name=my-target-domain.com
