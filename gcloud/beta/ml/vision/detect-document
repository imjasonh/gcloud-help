NAME
    gcloud beta ml vision detect-document - detect dense text in an image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta ml vision detect-document IMAGE_PATH
        [--language-hints=[LANGUAGE_HINTS,...]]
        [--model-version=MODEL_VERSION; default="builtin/stable"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Detect dense text in an image, such as books and research reports.

    Google Cloud Vision uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to analyze
    text. This is a premium feature for dense text such as books, research
    reports, and PDFs. To detect small amounts of text such as on signs, use
    detect-text instead. For more information on this feature, see the Google
    Cloud Vision documentation at https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/.

    Language hints can be provided to Google Cloud Vision API. In most cases,
    an empty value yields the best results since it enables automatic language
    detection. For languages based on the Latin alphabet, setting
    language_hints is not needed. Text detection returns an error if one or
    more of the specified languages is not one of the supported languages. (See
    https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/languages.) To provide language hints
    run:

        $ gcloud beta ml vision detect-document --language-hints ja,ko

EXAMPLES
    To detect dense text in image 'gs://my_bucket/input_file':

        $ gcloud beta ml vision detect-document gs://my_bucket/input_file

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_PATH
        Path to the image to be analyzed. This can be either a local path or a
        URL. If you provide a local file, the contents will be sent directly to
        Google Cloud Vision. If you provide a URL, it must be in Google Cloud
        Storage format (gs://bucket/object) or an HTTP URL (http://... or
        https://...)

FLAGS
     --language-hints=[LANGUAGE_HINTS,...]
        List of languages to use for text detection.

     --model-version=MODEL_VERSION; default="builtin/stable"
        Model version to use for the feature. MODEL_VERSION must be one of:
        builtin/latest, builtin/stable.
