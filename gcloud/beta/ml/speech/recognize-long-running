DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Get a transcript of audio up to 80 minutes in length. If the audio
    is under 60 seconds, you may also use gcloud beta ml speech recognize to
    analyze it.

EXAMPLES
    To block the command from completing until analysis is finished, run:

        $ gcloud beta ml speech recognize-long-running AUDIO_FILE \
            --language-code=LANGUAGE_CODE --sample-rate=SAMPLE_RATE

    You can also receive an operation as the result of the command by running:

        $ gcloud beta ml speech recognize-long-running AUDIO_FILE \
            --language-code=LANGUAGE_CODE --sample-rate=SAMPLE_RATE --async

    This will return information about an operation. To get information about
    the operation, run:

        $ gcloud beta ml speech operations describe OPERATION_ID

    To poll the operation until it's complete, run:

        $ gcloud beta ml speech operations wait OPERATION_ID

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     AUDIO
        The location of the audio file to transcribe. Must be a local path or a
        Google Cloud Storage URL (in the format gs://bucket/object).

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --language-code=LANGUAGE_CODE
        The language of the supplied audio as a BCP-47
        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag. Example:
        "en-US". See https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/languages for a list
        of the currently supported language codes.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --additional-language-codes=[LANGUAGE_CODE,...]
        The BCP-47 language tags of other languages that the speech may be in.
        Up to 3 can be provided.

        If alternative languages are listed, recognition result will contain
        recognition in the most likely language detected including the main
        language-code.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --enable-automatic-punctuation
        Adds punctuation to recognition result hypotheses.

     --encoding=ENCODING; default="encoding-unspecified"
        The type of encoding of the file. Required if the file format is not
        WAV or FLAC. ENCODING must be one of: alaw, amr, amr-wb,
        encoding-unspecified, flac, linear16, mp3, mulaw, ogg-opus,
        speex-with-header-byte, webm-opus.

     --filter-profanity
        If True, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing
        all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks,
        e.g. f***.

     --hints=[HINT,...]
        A list of strings containing word and phrase "hints" so that the speech
        recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be used to
        improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if
        specific commands are typically spoken by the user. This can also be
        used to add additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See
        https://cloud.google.com/speech/limits#content.

     --include-word-confidence
        Include a list of words and the confidence for those words in the top
        result.

     --include-word-time-offsets
        If True, the top result includes a list of words with the start and end
        time offsets (timestamps) for those words. If False, no word-level time
        offset information is returned.

     --max-alternatives=MAX_ALTERNATIVES; default=1
        Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned. The server may
        return fewer than max_alternatives. Valid values are 0-30. A value of 0
        or 1 will return a maximum of one.

     --model=MODEL
        Select the model best suited to your domain to get best results. If you
        do not explicitly specify a model, Speech-to-Text will auto-select a
        model based on your other specified parameters. Some models are premium
        and cost more than standard models (although you can reduce the price
        by opting into
        https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/data-logging). MODEL must
        be one of:

         command_and_search
            short queries such as voice commands or voice search.
         default
            audio that is not one of the specific audio models. For example,
            long-form audio. Ideally the audio is high-fidelity, recorded at a
            16khz or greater sampling rate.
         latest_long
            Use this model for any kind of long form content such as media or
            spontaneous speech and conversations. Consider using this model in
            place of the video model, especially if the video model is not
            available in your target language. You can also use this in place
            of the default model.
         latest_short
            Use this model for short utterances that are a few seconds in
            length. It is useful for trying to capture commands or other single
            shot directed speech use cases. Consider using this model instead
            of the command and search model.
         medical_conversation
            Best for audio that originated from a conversation between a
            medical provider and patient.
         medical_dictation
            Best for audio that originated from dictation notes by a medical
            provider.
         phone_call
            audio that originated from a phone call (typically recorded at an
            8khz sampling rate).
         phone_call_enhanced
            audio that originated from a phone call (typically recorded at an
            8khz sampling rate). This is a premium model and can produce better
            results but costs more than the standard rate.
         telephony
            Improved version of the "phone_call" model, best for audio that
            originated from a phone call, typically recorded at an 8kHz
            sampling rate.
         telephony_short
            Dedicated version of the modern "telephony" model for short or even
            single-word utterances for audio that originated from a phone call,
            typically recorded at an 8kHz sampling rate.
         video_enhanced
            audio that originated from video or includes multiple speakers.
            Ideally the audio is recorded at a 16khz or greater sampling rate.
            This is a premium model that costs more than the standard rate.

     --output-uri=OUTPUT_URI
        Location to which the results should be written. Must be a Google Cloud
        Storage URI.

     --sample-rate=SAMPLE_RATE
        The sample rate in Hertz. For best results, set the sampling rate of
        the audio source to 16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use the native
        sample rate of the audio source (instead of re-sampling).

     Audio channel settings.

       --audio-channel-count=AUDIO_CHANNEL_COUNT
          The number of channels in the input audio data. Set this for
          separate-channel-recognition. Valid values are: 1)LINEAR16 and FLAC
          are 1-8 2)OGG_OPUS are 1-254 3) MULAW, AMR, AMR_WB and
          SPEEX_WITH_HEADER_BYTE is only 1.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --separate-channel-recognition
          Recognition result will contain a channel_tag field to state which
          channel that result belongs to. If this is not true, only the first
          channel will be recognized.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

     --enable-speaker-diarization
        Enable speaker detection for each recognized word in the top
        alternative of the recognition result using an integer speaker_tag
        provided in the WordInfo.

     --max-diarization-speaker-count=MAX_DIARIZATION_SPEAKER_COUNT
        Maximum estimated number of speakers in the conversation being
        recognized.

     --min-diarization-speaker-count=MIN_DIARIZATION_SPEAKER_COUNT
        Minimum estimated number of speakers in the conversation being
        recognized.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
