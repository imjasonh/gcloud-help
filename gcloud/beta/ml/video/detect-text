            *  S is the number of seconds from the beginning of the video

        H, M and S can be specified as ints or floats for fractional units (to
        microsecond resolution). Unit chars (e.g. h, m or s) are required.
        Microseconds can be specified using fractional seconds e.g. 0.000569s
        == 569 microseconds.

        Examples:

        0s:23.554048s,24s:29.528064s
