DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Transcribe speech within a video.

EXAMPLES
    To transcribe speech in video file 'gs://my_bucket/input_file.mp4':

        $ gcloud beta ml video transcribe-speech \
            gs://my_bucket/input_file.mp4

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INPUT_PATH
        Path to the video to be analyzed. Must be a local path or a Google
        Cloud Storage URI.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --language-code=LANGUAGE_CODE
        The language of the supplied audio as a BCP-47
        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag. Example:
        "en-US". See Language Support
        (https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/languages) for a list of the
        currently supported language codes.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --audio-tracks=[AUDIO_TRACKS,...]
        For file formats, such as MXF or MKV, supporting multiple audio tracks,
        specify up to two commas separated tracks. Default track is 0.

     --diarization-speaker-count=DIARIZATION_SPEAKER_COUNT
        Optional estimated number of speakers in the conversation. If not
        specified, defaults to '2'. Ignored unless --enable-speaker-diarization
        is enabled.

     --enable-automatic-punctuation
        If enabled, adds punctuation to recognition result hypotheses. This
        feature is only available in select languages. Setting this for
        requests in other languages has no effect at all. The default disabled
        case does not add punctuation to result hypotheses.

     --enable-speaker-diarization
        If enabled, perform speaker detection for each recognized word in the
        top alternative of the recognition result using a speaker_tag provided
        in the WordInfo results section. When this is enabled, we send all the
        words from the beginning of the audio for the top alternative in every
        consecutive responses. This is done in order to improve our speaker
        tags as our models learn to identify the speakers in the conversation
        over time.

     --enable-word-confidence
        If enabled, the top result includes a list of words and the confidence
        for those words. If disabled, no word-level confidence information is
        returned. The default is disabled.

     --filter-profanity
        If enabled, the server will attempt to filter out profanities,
        replacing all but the initial character in each filtered word with
        asterisks, e.g. "f**". If disabled or omitted, profanities will not be
        filtered out.

     --hints=[HINTS,...]
        list of strings containing words and phrases "hints" so that the speech
        recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be used to
        improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if
        specific commands are typically spoken by the user. This can also be
        used to add additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See
        (https://cloud.google.com/speech/limits#content).

     --max-alternatives=MAX_ALTERNATIVES
        Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned. Specifically,
        the maximum number of SpeechRecognitionAlternative messages within each
        SpeechTranscription. The server may return fewer than max_alternatives.
        Valid values are 0-30. A value of 0 or 1 will return a maximum of one.
        If omitted, will return a maximum of one

     --output-uri=OUTPUT_URI
        Location to which the results should be written. Must be a Google Cloud
        Storage URI.

     --region=REGION
        Optional Cloud region where annotation should take place. If no region
        is specified, a region will be determined based on video file location.
        REGION must be one of: asia-east1, europe-west1, us-east1, us-west1.

     --segments=[SEGMENTS,...]
        Segments from the video which you want to analyze (by default, the
        entire video will be treated as one segment). Must be in the format
        START1:END1[,START2:END2,...] (inclusive). START and END of segments
        must be a properly formatted duration string of the form HhMmSs where:

            *  H is the number of hours from beginning of video
            *  M is the number of minutes from the beginning of video
            *  S is the number of seconds from the beginning of the video

        H, M and S can be specified as ints or floats for fractional units (to
        microsecond resolution). Unit chars (e.g. h, m or s) are required.
        Microseconds can be specified using fractional seconds e.g. 0.000569s
        == 569 microseconds.

        Examples:

        0s:23.554048s,24s:29.528064s

        0:1m40s,3m50s:5m10.232265s
