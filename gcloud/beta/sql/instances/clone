NAME
    gcloud beta sql instances clone - clones a Cloud SQL instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta sql instances clone SOURCE DESTINATION [--async]
        [--point-in-time=POINT_IN_TIME | --bin-log-file-name=BIN_LOG_FILE_NAME
          --bin-log-position=BIN_LOG_POSITION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta sql instances clone creates a clone of a Cloud SQL
    instance. The clone is an independent copy of the source instance with the
    same data and settings. Source and destination instances must be in the
    same project. An instance can be cloned from its current state, or from an
    earlier point in time.

    For MySQL: The binary log coordinates or timestamp (point in time), if
    specified, act as the point in time the source instance is cloned from. If
    not specified, the current state of the instance is cloned.

    For PostgreSQL: The point in time, if specified, defines a past state of
    the instance to clone. If not specified, the current state of the instance
    is cloned.

EXAMPLES
    To clone an instance from its current state (most recent binary log
    coordinates):

        $ gcloud beta sql instances clone instance-foo instance-bar

    To clone a MySQL instance from an earlier point in time (past binary log
    coordinates):

        $ gcloud beta sql instances clone instance-foo instance-bar \
            --bin-log-file-name mysql-bin.000020 --bin-log-position 170

    To clone a MySQL source instance at a specific point in time:

        $ gcloud beta sql instances clone instance-foo instance-bar \
            --point-in-time '2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z'

    To clone a PostgreSQL source instance at a specific point in time:

        $ gcloud beta sql instances clone instance-foo instance-bar \
            --point-in-time '2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SOURCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID of the source.

     DESTINATION
        Cloud SQL instance ID of the clone.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --point-in-time=POINT_IN_TIME
          Represents the state of an instance at any given point in time inside
          a transaction log file. For MySQL, the binary log file is used for
          transaction logs. For PostgreSQL, the write-ahead log file is used
          for transaction logs. To create a transaction log, enable
          point-in-time recovery on the source instance. Instance should have
          transaction logs accumulated upto the point in time they want to
          restore upto. Uses RFC 3339 format in UTC timezone. If specified,
          defines a past state of the instance to clone. For example,
          '2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z'.

       Binary log coordinates for point-in-time recovery.

         --bin-log-file-name=BIN_LOG_FILE_NAME
            The name of the binary log file. Enable point-in-time recovery on
            the source instance to create a binary log file. If specified with
            <--bin-log-position> to form a valid binary log coordinate, it
            defines an earlier point in time to clone a source instance from.
            For example, mysql-bin.000001.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --bin-log-position=BIN_LOG_POSITION
            Represents the state of an instance at any given point in time
            inside a binary log file. If specified along with
            <--bin-log-file-name> to form a valid binary log coordinate, it
            defines an earlier point in time to clone a source instance from.
            For example, 123 (a numeric value).

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.
