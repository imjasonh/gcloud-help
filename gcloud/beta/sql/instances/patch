        Switches the location of the transaction logs used for PITR from disk
        to Cloud Storage.

     --threads-per-core=THREADS_PER_CORE
        The number of threads per core. The value of this flag can be 1 or 2.
        To disable SMT, set this flag to 1. Only available in Cloud SQL for SQL
        Server instances.

     --tier=TIER, -t TIER
        Machine type for a shared-core instance e.g. db-g1-small. For all other
        instances, instead of using tiers, customize your instance by
        specifying its CPU and memory. You can do so with the --cpu and
        --memory flags. Learn more about how CPU and memory affects pricing:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing. WARNING: Instance will be
        restarted.

     --time-zone=TIME_ZONE
        Set a non-default time zone. Only available for SQL Server instances.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --upgrade-sql-network-architecture
        Upgrade from old network architecture to new network architecture. The
        new network architecture offers better isolation, reliability, and
        faster new feature adoption.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --allowed-psc-projects=PROJECT,[PROJECT,...]
          A comma-separated list of projects. Each project in this list might
          be represented by a project number (numeric) or by a project ID
          (alphanumeric). This allows Private Service Connect connections to be
          established from specified consumer projects.

       --clear-allowed-psc-projects
          This will clear the project allowlist of Private Service Connect,
          disallowing all projects from creating new Private Service Connect
          bindings to the instance.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --authorized-gae-apps=APP,[APP,...]
          First Generation instances only. List of project IDs for App Engine
          applications running in the Standard environment that can access this
          instance.

          The value given for this argument replaces the existing list.

       --clear-gae-apps
          Specified to clear the list of App Engine apps that can access this
          instance.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --authorized-networks=NETWORK,[NETWORK,...]
          The list of external networks that are allowed to connect to the
          instance. Specified in CIDR notation, also known as 'slash' notation
          (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24).

          The value given for this argument replaces the existing list.

       --clear-authorized-networks
          Clear the list of external networks that are allowed to connect to
          the instance.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-connection-pool-flags
          This will clear the connection pool flags set on the instance.

       --connection-pool-flags=FLAG=VALUE,[FLAG=VALUE,...]
          Comma-separated list of connection pool flags to set on the instance
          connection pool. Use an equals sign to separate flag name and value.
          View the Instance Resource API for allowed flags. (e.g.,
          --connection-pool-flags
          max_pool_size=1000,max_client_connections=2000)

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-custom-subject-alternative-names
          This clears the customer specified DNS names.

       --custom-subject-alternative-names=DNS,[DNS,[DNS]]
          A comma-separated list of DNS names to add to the instance's SSL
          certificate. A custom SAN is a structured way to add additional DNS
          names (host names) that are not managed by Cloud SQL to an instance.
          It allows for hostname verification during establishment of a
          database connection using the DNS name over SSL/TLS. When you create
          and/or update an instance, you can add a comma-separated list of up
          to three DNS names to the server certificate of your instance.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-database-flags
          Clear the database flags set on the instance. WARNING: Instance will
          be restarted.

       --database-flags=FLAG=VALUE,[FLAG=VALUE,...]
          Comma-separated list of database flags to set on the instance. Use an
          equals sign to separate flag name and value. Flags without values,
          like skip_grant_tables, can be written out without a value after,
          e.g., skip_grant_tables=. Use on/off for booleans. View the Instance
          Resource API for allowed flags. (e.g., --database-flags
          max_allowed_packet=55555,skip_grant_tables=,log_output=1)

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud beta sql instances patch --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud beta sql instances patch --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-psc-auto-connections
          This removes all connections created automatically. Cloud SQL uses
          these connections to connect to an instance using Private Service
          Connect.

       --psc-auto-connections=[network=NETWORK],[project=PROJECT]
          A comma-separated list of networks or a comma-separated list of
          network-project pairs. Each project in this list is represented by a
          project number (numeric) or by a project ID (alphanumeric). This
          allows Private Service Connect connections to be created
          automatically for the specified networks. For example, this
          connection uses "the form
          psc-auto-connections=network=projects/testproject1/global/networks/testnetwork1"
          or "the form
          psc-auto-connections=project=testproject1,network=projects/testproject1/global/networks/testnetwork1".
          Sets psc_auto_connections value.

           network
              Required, sets network value.

           project
              Sets project value.

          Shorthand Example:

              --psc-auto-connections=network=string,project=string

          JSON Example:

              --psc-auto-connections='{"network": "string", "project": "string"}'

          File Example:

              --psc-auto-connections=path_to_file.(yaml|json)

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --gce-zone=GCE_ZONE
          (DEPRECATED) Preferred Compute Engine zone (e.g. us-central1-a,
          us-central1-b, etc.). WARNING: Instance may be restarted.

          Flag --gce-zone is deprecated and will be removed by release 255.0.0.
          Use --zone instead.

       --secondary-zone=SECONDARY_ZONE
          Preferred secondary Compute Engine zone (e.g. us-central1-a,
          us-central1-b, etc.).

       --zone=ZONE
          Preferred Compute Engine zone (e.g. us-central1-a, us-central1-b,
          etc.). WARNING: Instance may be restarted.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --no-backup
          Specified if daily backup should be disabled.

       --backup-location=BACKUP_LOCATION
          Choose where to store your backups. Backups are stored in the closest
          multi-region location to you by default. Only customize if needed.
          Specify empty string to revert to default.

       --backup-start-time=BACKUP_START_TIME
          Start time of daily backups, specified in the HH:MM format, in the
          UTC timezone.

       --retained-backups-count=RETAINED_BACKUPS_COUNT
          How many backups to keep. The valid range is between 1 and 365.
          Default value is 7 for Enterprise edition instances. For
          Enterprise_Plus, default value is 15. Applicable only if --no-backups
          is not specified.

       --retained-transaction-log-days=RETAINED_TRANSACTION_LOG_DAYS
          How many days of transaction logs to keep. The valid range is between
          1 and 35. Only use this option when point-in-time recovery is
          enabled. If logs are stored on disk, storage size for transaction
          logs could increase when the number of days for log retention
          increases. For Enterprise, default and max retention values are 7 and
          7 respectively. For Enterprise_Plus, default and max retention values
          are 14 and 35.
