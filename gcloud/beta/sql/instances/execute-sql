NAME
    gcloud beta sql instances execute-sql - executes a statement on a Cloud SQL
        instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta sql instances execute-sql INSTANCE --sql=SQL
        [--database=DATABASE, -d DATABASE]
        [--partial_result_mode=PARTIAL_RESULT_MODE] [--row_limit=ROW_LIMIT]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Executes a statement on a Cloud SQL instance. It will use the
    credentials of the specified Google Cloud account to connect to the
    instance, so an IAM user with the same name must exist in the instance. It
    doesn't support DQL or DML statements yet. WARNING: The requests and
    responses might transit through intermediate locations between your client
    and the location of the target instance.

EXAMPLES
    To execute a statement on a Cloud SQL instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta sql instances execute-sql instance-foo \
            --sql="ALTER TABLE employees RENAME TO personnel;" \
            --database=db1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --sql=SQL
        SQL statement(s) to execute. It supports multiple statements as well.
        When it starts with the character '@', the rest should be a filepath to
        read the SQL statement(s) from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --database=DATABASE, -d DATABASE
        Database on which the statement is executed.

     --partial_result_mode=PARTIAL_RESULT_MODE
        Controls how the API should respond when the SQL execution result is
        incomplete due to size limit or other reasons. The default mode is to
        throw an error instead of returning the partial result.
        PARTIAL_RESULT_MODE must be one of:

         ALLOW_PARTIAL_RESULT
            Return the partial result and mark the field partial_result to true
            if the complete result can't be returned. Don't throw an error.
         FAIL_PARTIAL_RESULT
            Throw an error if the complete result can't be returned. Don't
            return the partial result.
         PARTIAL_RESULT_MODE_UNSPECIFIED
            Unspecified mode, effectively the same as FAIL_PARTIAL_RESULT.

     --row_limit=ROW_LIMIT
        Maximum number of rows to return. The default is unlimited.
