DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta sql instances point-in-time-restore performs a point in
    time restore for a Cloud SQL instance managed by Google Cloud Backup and
    Disaster Recovery.

EXAMPLES
    To perform a point in time restore from an earlier point in time:

        $ gcloud beta sql instances point-in-time-restore datasource \
            target-instance '2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DATASOURCE
        The Google Cloud Backup and Disaster Recovery Datasource URI, of the
        form projects/{project}/locations/{region}/backupVaults/
        {backupvault}/dataSources/{datasource}.

     TARGET
        Cloud SQL instance ID of the target instance.

     POINT_IN_TIME
        The point in time in which to restore the instance to. Uses RFC 3339
        format in UTC timezone. For example, '2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z'.

FLAGS
     --allocated-ip-range-name=ALLOCATED_IP_RANGE_NAME
        The name of the IP range allocated for the target instance with private
        network connectivity. For example: 'google-managed-services-default'.
        If set, the target instance IP is created in the allocated range
        represented by this name. Reserved for future use.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --preferred-secondary-zone=PREFERRED_SECONDARY_ZONE
        The preferred secondary zone for the cloned regional instance. If you
        specify a value for this flag, then the target instance uses the value
        as the secondary zone. The secondary zone can't be the same as the
        primary zone.

     --preferred-zone=PREFERRED_ZONE
        The preferred zone for the target instance. If you specify a value for
        this flag, then the target instance uses the value as the primary zone.

     --private-network=PRIVATE_NETWORK
        The resource link for the VPC network from which the Cloud SQL instance
        is accessible for private IP. For example,
        '/projects/myProject/global/networks/default'.

     --restore-database-names=RESTORE_DATABASE_NAMES
        The name of the databases to be restored for a point-in-time restore.
        If set, the destination instance will only restore the specified
        databases.

    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
