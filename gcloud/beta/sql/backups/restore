DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) The command lets you restore to an existing instance using ID. To
    restore using a backupDR backup, use the backupDR ID. When backup Name is
    used to restore it lets you restore to an existing instance or a new
    instance. When restoring to new instance, optional flags can be used to
    customize the new instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ID
        The ID of the backup run to restore from or the backup NAME for restore
        to existing/new instance. To find the NAME, run the following command:
        $ gcloud sql backups list --filter=instance:{instance}

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --restore-instance=RESTORE_INSTANCE
        The ID of the target Cloud SQL instance that the backup is restored to.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --activation-policy=ACTIVATION_POLICY
        Activation policy for this instance. This specifies when the instance
        should be activated and is applicable only when the instance state is
        RUNNABLE. The default is always. More information on activation
        policies can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/start-stop-restart-instance#activation_policy.
        ACTIVATION_POLICY must be one of: always, never.

     --active-directory-domain=ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_DOMAIN
        Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory domain this instance is
        joined to. Only available for SQL Server instances.

     --[no-]assign-ip
        Assign a public IP address to the instance. This is a public,
        externally available IPv4 address that you can use to connect to your
        instance when properly authorized. Use --assign-ip to enable and
        --no-assign-ip to disable.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --audit-bucket-path=AUDIT_BUCKET_PATH
        The location, as a Cloud Storage bucket, to which audit files are
        uploaded. The URI is in the form gs://bucketName/folderName. Only
        available for SQL Server instances.

     --audit-retention-interval=AUDIT_RETENTION_INTERVAL
        The number of days for audit log retention on disk, for example, 3dfor
        3 days. Only available for SQL Server instances.

        minutes. Only available for SQL Server instances.

     --authorized-networks=NETWORK,[NETWORK,...]
        The list of external networks that are allowed to connect to the
        instance. Specified in CIDR notation, also known as 'slash' notation
        (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24).

     --availability-type=AVAILABILITY_TYPE
        Specifies level of availability. AVAILABILITY_TYPE must be one of:

         regional
            Provides high availability and is recommended for production
            instances; instance automatically fails over to another zone within
            your selected region.
         zonal
            Provides no failover capability. This is the default.

     --backup
        Enables daily backup. Enabled by default, use --no-backup to disable.

     --backup-instance=BACKUP_INSTANCE
        The ID of the instance that the backup was taken from. This argument
        must be specified when the backup instance is different from the
        restore instance. If it is not specified, the backup instance is
        considered the same as the restore instance. This flag is not supported
        when restore happens from backup name, only supported when restore
        happens from backup ID in timestamp format.

     --backup-location=BACKUP_LOCATION
        Choose where to store your backups. Backups are stored in the closest
        multi-region location to you by default. Only customize if needed.

     --backup-project=BACKUP_PROJECT
        The project of the instance to which the backup belongs. If it isn't
        specified, backup and restore instances are in the same project. This
        flag is not supported when restore happens from backup name, only
        supported when restore happens from backup ID in timestamp format.

     --backup-start-time=BACKUP_START_TIME
        Start time of daily backups, specified in the HH:MM format, in the UTC
        timezone.

     --clear-network
        Clears the network setting. This is useful to restore a backup to a
        different project or region where the original network configuration
        isn't available.

     --collation=COLLATION
        Cloud SQL server-level collation setting, which specifies the set of
        rules for comparing characters in a character set.

     --connector-enforcement=CONNECTOR_ENFORCEMENT
        Cloud SQL Connector enforcement mode. It determines how Cloud SQL
        Connectors are used in the connection. See the list of modes here
        (https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api/rest/v1beta4/instances#connectorenforcement).
        CONNECTOR_ENFORCEMENT must be one of:

         CONNECTOR_ENFORCEMENT_UNSPECIFIED
            The requirement for Cloud SQL connectors is unknown.
         NOT_REQUIRED
            Does not require Cloud SQL connectors.
         REQUIRED
            Requires all connections to use Cloud SQL connectors, including the
            Cloud SQL Auth Proxy and Cloud SQL Java, Python, and Go connectors.
            Note: This disables all existing authorized networks.

     --cpu=CPU
        Whole number value indicating how many cores are desired in the
        machine. Both --cpu and --memory must be specified if a custom machine
        type is desired, and the --tier flag must be omitted.--cpu and --memory
        flags are not compatible with the Enterprise Plus edition. These flags
        should not be used when creating an Enterprise Plus edition, as the
        machine configuration is determined by the --tier flag instead.

     --database-version=DATABASE_VERSION
        The database engine type and versions. If left unspecified, no changes
        occur. See the list of database versions at
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api/rest/v1beta4/SqlDatabaseVersion.
        Note for restore to new instance major version upgrades are not
        supported. Only minor version upgrades are allowed.

     --[no-]deletion-protection
        Enable deletion protection on a Cloud SQL instance. Use
        --deletion-protection to enable and --no-deletion-protection to
        disable.

        Specifies the edition of Cloud SQL instance. EDITION must be one of:
        enterprise, enterprise-plus.

     --enable-bin-log
        Allows for data recovery from a specific point in time, down to a
        fraction of a second. Must have automatic backups enabled to use. Make
        sure storage can support at least 7 days of logs.

     --enable-google-private-path
        Enable a private path for Google Cloud services. This flag specifies
        whether the instance is accessible to internal Google Cloud services
        such as BigQuery. This is only applicable to MySQL and PostgreSQL
        instances that don't use public IP. Currently, SQL Server isn't
        supported.

     --enable-point-in-time-recovery
        Allows for data recovery from a specific point in time, down to a
        fraction of a second, via write-ahead logs. Must have automatic backups

        Number of query plans to sample every minute. Default value is 5.
        Allowed range: 0 to 20.

     --insights-config-query-string-length=INSIGHTS_CONFIG_QUERY_STRING_LENGTH
        Sets the default query length limit. For Cloud SQL Enterprise edition,
        the range is from 256 to 4500 (in bytes) and the default query length
        is 1024 bytes. For Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition, the range is from
        1024 to 100,000 (in bytes) and the default query length is 10,000
        bytes.

     --insights-config-record-application-tags
        Allow application tags to be recorded by the query insights feature.

     --insights-config-record-client-address
        Allow the client address to be recorded by the query insights feature.

     --maintenance-release-channel=MAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL
        Which channel's updates to apply during the maintenance window. If not
        specified, Cloud SQL chooses the timing of updates to your instance.
        MAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL must be one of:

         preview
            Preview updates release prior to production updates. You may wish
            to use the preview channel for dev/test applications so that you
            can preview their compatibility with your application prior to the
            production release.
         production
            Production updates are stable and recommended for applications in
            production.
         week5
            week5 updates release after the production updates. Use the week5
            channel to receive a 5 week advance notification about the upcoming
            maintenance, so you can prepare your application for the release.

     --maintenance-window-day=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY
        Day of week for maintenance window, in UTC time zone.
        MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY must be one of: SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI,
        SAT.

     --maintenance-window-hour=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_HOUR
        Hour of day for maintenance window, in UTC time zone.

     --memory=MEMORY
        Whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
        machine. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MiB or 9GiB) - if no
        units are specified, GiB is assumed. Both --cpu and --memory must be
        specified if a custom machine type is desired, and the --tier flag must
        be omitted. --cpu and --memory flags are not compatible with the
        Enterprise Plus edition. These flags should not be used when creating
        an Enterprise Plus edition, as the machine configuration is determined
        by the --tier flag instead.

     --network=NETWORK
        Network in the current project that the instance will be part of. To
        specify using a network with a shared VPC, use the full URL of the
        network. For an example host project, 'testproject', and shared
        network, 'testsharednetwork', this would use the form:
        --network=projects/testproject/global/networks/testsharednetwork

     --require-ssl
        Specified if users connecting over IP must use SSL.

     --retained-backups-count=RETAINED_BACKUPS_COUNT
        How many backups to keep. The valid range is between 1 and 365. Default
        value is 7 for Enterprise edition instances. For Enterprise_Plus,
        default value is 15. Applicable only if --no-backups is not specified.

     --retained-transaction-log-days=RETAINED_TRANSACTION_LOG_DAYS
        How many days of transaction logs to keep. The valid range is between 1
        and 35. Only use this option when point-in-time recovery is enabled. If
        logs are stored on disk, storage size for transaction logs could
        increase when the number of days for log retention increases. For
        Enterprise, default and max retention values are 7 and 7 respectively.
        For Enterprise_Plus, default and max retention values are 14 and 35.

     --ssl-mode=SSL_MODE
        Set the SSL mode of the instance. SSL_MODE must be one of:

         ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED
            Allow non-SSL and SSL connections. For SSL connections, client
            certificate will not be verified.
         ENCRYPTED_ONLY
            Only allow connections encrypted with SSL/TLS.
         TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED
            Only allow connections encrypted with SSL/TLS and with valid client
            certificates.

     --[no-]storage-auto-increase
        Storage size can be increased, but it cannot be decreased; storage
        increases are permanent for the life of the instance. With this setting
        enabled, a spike in storage requirements can result in permanently
        increased storage costs for your instance. However, if an instance runs
        out of available space, it can result in the instance going offline,
        dropping existing connections. This setting is enabled by default. Use
        --storage-auto-increase to enable and --no-storage-auto-increase to
        disable.

     --storage-provisioned-iops=STORAGE_PROVISIONED_IOPS
        Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the data disk. This sets the
        number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle.

     --storage-provisioned-throughput=STORAGE_PROVISIONED_THROUGHPUT
        Indicates how much throughput to provision for the data disk. This sets
        the throughput in MB per second that the disk can handle.

     --storage-size=STORAGE_SIZE
        Amount of storage allocated to the instance. Must be an integer number
        of GB. The default is 10GB. Information on storage limits can be found
        here: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/quotas#storage_limits

     --storage-type=STORAGE_TYPE
        The storage type for the instance. The default is SSD. STORAGE_TYPE
        must be one of: SSD, HDD, HYPERDISK_BALANCED.

     --tier=TIER, -t TIER
        Machine type for a shared-core instance e.g. db-g1-small. For all other
        instances, instead of using tiers, customize your instance by
        specifying its CPU and memory. You can do so with the --cpu and
        --memory flags. Learn more about how CPU and memory affects pricing:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing.

     --time-zone=TIME_ZONE
        Set a non-default time zone. Only available for SQL Server instances.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default=3600
        Time to synchronously wait for the operation to complete, after which
        the operation continues asynchronously. Ignored if --async flag is
        specified. By default, set to 3600s. To wait indefinitely, set to
        unlimited.

     --allowed-psc-projects=PROJECT,[PROJECT,...]
        A comma-separated list of projects. Each project in this list might be
        represented by a project number (numeric) or by a project ID
        (alphanumeric). This allows Private Service Connect connections to be
        established from specified consumer projects.

     --enable-private-service-connect
        Enable connecting to the Cloud SQL instance with Private Service
        Connect.
