NAME
    gcloud beta firebase test network-profiles - explore network profiles
        available for testing

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta firebase test network-profiles COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) A network traffic profile consists of a set of parameters to emulate
    network conditions when running a test. This feature only works on physical
    devices. The network shaping parameters are:

      ▪ RULE: Where to apply traffic shaping. The UP rule shapes the
        connection from the device to the internet. The DOWN rule shapes the
        connection from the internet to the device.
      ▪ DELAY: The delay in packet transmission, in ms.
      ▪ LOSS_RATIO: The ratio of packets dropped during transmission.
      ▪ DUPLICATION_RATIO: The ratio of packets duplicated during
        transmission.
      ▪ BANDWIDTH: The average packet transmission rate in kbits/s, as
        defined by the token bucket algorithm.
      ▪ BURST: The total size, in kbits, by which packets can exceed the
        bandwidth, as defined by the token bucket algorithm.

EXAMPLES
    To list all network profiles which can be used for testing, run:

        $ gcloud beta firebase test network-profiles list

    To view information about a specific network profile, run:

        $ gcloud beta firebase test network-profiles describe PROFILE_ID

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
