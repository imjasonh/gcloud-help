NAME
    gcloud beta quotas info - manage Cloud Quotas QuotaInfo

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta quotas info COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) QuotaInfo is a read-only resource that provides metadata and quota
    value information about a particular quota for a given project, folder or
    organization. The QuotaInfo resource contains:

      ▪ Metadata such as name and dimension.
      ▪ Quota values for different quota dimensions.

    Cloud Quotas obtains information from the quotas defined by Google Cloud
    services and any fulfilled quota adjustments that you initiate.

    Note: Because QuotaInfo is constructed by incorporating information from
    different sources, a default quota configuration exists even if you have
    not created a QuotaPreference resource. Until you express a preferred state
    through quotaPreference.create or quotaPreference.update, QuotaInfo relies
    on the default quota information available to determine what quota value to
    enforce.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
