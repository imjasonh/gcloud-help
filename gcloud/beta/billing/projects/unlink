NAME
    gcloud beta billing projects unlink - unlink the account (if any) linked
        with a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta billing projects unlink PROJECT_ID [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command unlinks a project from its associated billing account.
    This action disables billing on the project. Any billable resources and
    services in use in your project are stopped, and your application stops
    functioning. Any costs accrued prior to disabling billing on the project
    are charged to the previously associated billing account.

    Note: To link a project to a different billing account, use the billing
    projects link command. You do not need to unlink the project first.

EXAMPLES
    To unlink the project my-project from its linked billing account, run:

        $ gcloud beta billing projects unlink my-project

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PROJECT_ID
        Specify a project id.
