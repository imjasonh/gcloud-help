NAME
    gcloud beta billing projects link - link a project with a billing account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta billing projects link PROJECT_ID --billing-account=ACCOUNT_ID
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command sets or updates the billing account associated with a
    project.

    Billing is enabled on a project when the project is linked to a valid,
    active Cloud Billing account. The billing account accrues charges for the
    usage of resources in all of the linked projects. If the project is already
    linked to a billing account, this command moves the project to the billing
    account you specify, updating the billing account that is linked to the
    project.

    Note that associating a project with a closed billing account has the same
    effect as disabling billing on the project: any paid resources in use by
    the project are shut down, and your application stops functioning. Unless
    you want to disable billing, you should always specify a valid, active
    Cloud Billing account when you run this command. Learn how to confirm the
    status of a Cloud Billing account at
    https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#billing_account_status

EXAMPLES
    To link a billing account 0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X with a project my-project,
    run:

        $ gcloud beta billing projects link my-project \
            --billing-account=0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X
