NAME
    gcloud beta source repos clone - clone a cloud source repository

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta source repos clone REPOSITORY_NAME [DIRECTORY_NAME] [--dry-run]
        [--use-full-gcloud-path] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command clones a git repository from the currently active
    Google Cloud project into the specified directory or into the current
    directory if no target directory is specified.

    Each Google Cloud project can have zero or more git repositories associated
    with it. To see the available repositories, run:

        $ gcloud beta source repos list

    The clone operation configures the local clone to use your gcloud
    credentials to authenticate future git operations. This command emits a
    warning if the cloud source repository is a mirror.

EXAMPLES
    The example commands below show a sample workflow.

        $ gcloud init

        $ gcloud beta source repos clone REPOSITORY_NAME DIRECTORY_NAME

        $ cd DIRECTORY_NAME ... create/edit files and create one or more \
            commits ...

        $ git push origin main

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     REPOSITORY_NAME
        Name of the repository.

     [DIRECTORY_NAME]
        Directory name for the cloned repo. Defaults to the repository name.

FLAGS
     --dry-run
        If provided, prints the command that would be run to standard out
        instead of executing it.

     --use-full-gcloud-path
        If provided, use the full gcloud path for the git credential.helper.
        Using the full path means that gcloud does not need to be in the path
        for future git operations on the repository.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
