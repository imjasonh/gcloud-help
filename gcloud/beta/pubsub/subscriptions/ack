NAME
    gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions ack - acknowledges one or more messages on
        the specified subscription

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions ack SUBSCRIPTION [ACK_ID ...]
        [--ack-ids=[ACK_ID,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Acknowledges one or more messages as having been successfully
    received. If a delivered message is not acknowledged within the
    Subscription's ack deadline, Cloud Pub/Sub will attempt to deliver it
    again.

    To automatically acknowledge messages when pulling from a Subscription, you
    can use the --auto-ack flag on gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - Name of the subscription to ACK messages on. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument subscription on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          ID of the subscription or fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription. To set the subscription attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument subscription on the command line.

     [ACK_ID ...]
        (DEPRECATED) One or more ACK_ID to acknowledge. An ACK_ID is a string
        that is returned to subscribers
        (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rpc/google.pubsub.v1#google.pubsub.v1.ReceivedMessage).
        along with the message. The ACK_ID is different from the message ID
        (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rpc/google.pubsub.v1#google.pubsub.v1.PubsubMessage).

        Positional argument ACK_ID is deprecated. Please use --ack-ids instead.
