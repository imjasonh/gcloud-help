        specified name;

          ▸ provide the argument subscription on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --push-endpoint=PUSH_ENDPOINT

        automatically set the subscription type to PUSH.

OPTIONAL FLAGS

        Connect token for authenticated push.

        Audience used in the generated Open ID Connect token for authenticated
        push. If not specified, it will be set to the push-endpoint.

     NoWrapper Config Options.

       --push-no-wrapper
          When set, the message data is delivered directly as the HTTP body.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --push-no-wrapper-write-metadata
          When true, writes the Pub/Sub message metadata to
          x-goog-pubsub-<KEY>:<VAL> headers of the HTTP request. Writes the
