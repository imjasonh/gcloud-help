NAME
    gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions modify-message-ack-deadline - modifies the
        ACK deadline for a specific Cloud Pub/Sub message

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions modify-message-ack-deadline SUBSCRIPTION
        ([ACK_ID ...] --ack-ids=[ACK_ID,...]) --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This method is useful to indicate that more time is needed to
    process a message by the subscriber, or to make the message available for
    redelivery if the processing was interrupted.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - Name of the subscription messages belong to. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument subscription on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          ID of the subscription or fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription.

          To set the subscription attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument subscription on the command line.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       [ACK_ID ...]
          (DEPRECATED) One or more ACK_IDs to modify the deadline for. An
          ACK_ID is a string that is returned to subscribers
          (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rpc/google.pubsub.v1#google.pubsub.v1.ReceivedMessage).
          along with the message. The ACK_ID is different from the message ID
          (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rpc/google.pubsub.v1#google.pubsub.v1.PubsubMessage).

          Positional argument ACK_ID is deprecated. Please use --ack-ids
          instead.

       --ack-ids=[ACK_ID,...]
          One or more ACK_IDs to modify the deadline for. An ACK_ID is a string
          that is returned to subscribers
          (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rpc/google.pubsub.v1#google.pubsub.v1.ReceivedMessage).
          along with the message. The ACK_ID is different from the message ID
          (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rpc/google.pubsub.v1#google.pubsub.v1.PubsubMessage).

     --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
