DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Creates one or more Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions for a given topic.
    The new subscription defaults to a PULL subscription unless a push endpoint
    is specified.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - One or more subscriptions to create. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument subscription on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION [SUBSCRIPTION ...]
          IDs of the subscriptions or fully qualified identifiers for the
          subscriptions. To set the subscription attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument subscription on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Topic resource - Name of the topic from which this subscription is
     receiving messages. Each subscription is attached to a single topic. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource.

     This must be specified.

       --topic=TOPIC
          ID of the topic or fully qualified identifier for the topic. To set
          the topic attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --topic on the command line.

          This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --topic-project=TOPIC_PROJECT
          Project ID of the Google Cloud project for the topic. To set the
          project attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --topic on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --topic-project on the command line;
          ▸ provide the argument --project on the command line;
          ▸ set the property core/project.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
        The number of seconds the system will wait for a subscriber to
        acknowledge receiving a message before re-attempting delivery.

     --enable-message-ordering
        Whether to receive messages with the same ordering key in order. If
        set, messages with the same ordering key are sent to subscribers in the
        order that Pub/Sub receives them.

     --expiration-period=EXPIRATION_PERIOD
        The subscription will expire if it is inactive for the given period.
        Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one
        of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days,
        respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed. This flag
        additionally accepts the special value "never" to indicate that the
        subscription will never expire.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --message-filter=MESSAGE_FILTER
        Expression to filter messages. If set, Pub/Sub only delivers the
        messages that match the filter. The expression must be a non-empty
        string in the Pub/Sub filtering language
        (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering).

     --message-retention-duration=MESSAGE_RETENTION_DURATION
        How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
        backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
        --retain-acked-messages is true, this also configures the retention of
        acknowledged messages. The default value is 7 days, the minimum is 10
        minutes, and the maximum is 7 days. Valid values are strings of the
        form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for
        seconds, minutes, hours, and days, respectively. If the unit is
        omitted, seconds is assumed.

     --push-auth-service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
        Service account email used as the identity for the generated Open ID
        Connect token for authenticated push.

     --push-auth-token-audience=OPTIONAL_AUDIENCE_OVERRIDE
        Audience used in the generated Open ID Connect token for authenticated
        push. If not specified, it will be set to the push-endpoint.

     --push-endpoint=PUSH_ENDPOINT
        A URL to use as the endpoint for this subscription. This will also
        automatically set the subscription type to PUSH.

     --retain-acked-messages
        Whether or not to retain acknowledged messages. If true, messages are
        not expunged from the subscription's backlog until they fall out of the
        --message-retention-duration window. Acknowledged messages are not
        retained by default.

     Dead Letter Queue Options. The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated
     with the enclosing subscription's parent project (i.e.,
     service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
     permission to Publish() to this topic and Acknowledge() messages on this
     subscription.

       --max-delivery-attempts=MAX_DELIVERY_ATTEMPTS
          Maximum number of delivery attempts for any message. The value must
          be between 5 and 100. Defaults to 5. --dead-letter-topic must also be
          specified.

       Dead letter topic resource - Name of the topic to publish dead letter
       messages to. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
       attributes of this resource.

         --dead-letter-topic=DEAD_LETTER_TOPIC
            ID of the dead-letter-topic or fully qualified identifier for the
            dead-letter-topic. To set the topic attribute:
            ▫ provide the argument --dead-letter-topic on the command line.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --dead-letter-topic-project=DEAD_LETTER_TOPIC_PROJECT
            Project ID of the Google Cloud project for the dead-letter-topic.
            To set the project attribute:
            ▫ provide the argument --dead-letter-topic on the command line
              with a fully specified name;
            ▫ provide the argument --dead-letter-topic-project on the command
              line;
            ▫ provide the argument --project on the command line;
            ▫ set the property core/project.

     Retry Policy Options. Retry policy specifies how Cloud Pub/Sub retries
     message delivery for this subscription.

       --max-retry-delay=MAX_RETRY_DELAY
          The maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message.
          Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
          Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one
          of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days,
          respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed.

       --min-retry-delay=MIN_RETRY_DELAY
          The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message.
          Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
          Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one
          of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days,
          respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed.
