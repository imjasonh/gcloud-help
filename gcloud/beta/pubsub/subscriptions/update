DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Updates an existing Cloud Pub/Sub subscription.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - Name of the subscription to update. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument subscription on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          ID of the subscription or fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription.

          To set the subscription attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument subscription on the command line.

FLAGS
     --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
        The number of seconds the system will wait for a subscriber to
        acknowledge receiving a message before re-attempting delivery.

     --enable-exactly-once-delivery
        Whether or not to enable exactly-once delivery on the subscription. If
        true, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the delivery of a
        message with a given value of message_id on this subscription: The
        message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be resent before the
        message's acknowledgment deadline expires. An acknowledged message will
        not be resent to a subscriber. Use --no-enable-exactly-once-delivery to
        disable this flag.

     --expiration-period=EXPIRATION_PERIOD
        The subscription will expire if it is inactive for the given period.
        Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one
        of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days,
        respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed. This flag
        additionally accepts the special value "never" to indicate that the
        subscription will never expire.

     --message-retention-duration=MESSAGE_RETENTION_DURATION
        How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
        backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
        --retain-acked-messages is true, this also configures the retention of
        acknowledged messages. Specify "default" to use the default value of 7
        days. The minimum is 10 minutes, and the maximum is 31 days. Valid
        values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one of "s",
        "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days, respectively.
        If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed.

     --retain-acked-messages
        Whether or not to retain acknowledged messages. If true, messages are
        not expunged from the subscription's backlog until they fall out of the
        --message-retention-duration window. Acknowledged messages are not
        retained by default. Use --no-retain-acked-messages to disable this
        flag.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --clear-bigquery-config
            If set, clear the BigQuery config from the subscription. Use
            --no-clear-bigquery-config to disable this flag.

         BigQuery Config Options. The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated
         with the enclosing subscription's parent project (i.e.,
         service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must
         have permission to write to this BigQuery table.

         When updating BigQueryConfig flags, all BigQueryConfig flags must be
         specified. Otherwise, any omitted BigQueryConfig flags revert to their
         default value.

           --bigquery-table=BIGQUERY_TABLE
              A BigQuery table of the form
              {project}:{dataset_name}.{table_name} to which to write messages
              for this subscription.

              This flag argument must be specified if any of the other
              arguments in this group are specified.

           --bigquery-service-account-email=BIGQUERY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
              The service account email to use when writing to BigQuery. If
              unspecified, uses the Pub/Sub service agent
              (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents).

           --drop-unknown-fields
              If either --use-topic-schema or --use-table-schema is set,
              whether or not to ignore fields in the message that do not appear
              in the BigQuery table schema. Use --no-drop-unknown-fields to
              disable this flag.

           --write-metadata
              Whether or not to write message metadata including message ID,
              publish timestamp, ordering key, and attributes to BigQuery. The
              subscription name, message_id, and publish_time fields are put in
              their own columns while all other message properties other than
              data (for example, an ordering_key, if present) are written to a
              JSON object in the attributes column. Use --no-write-metadata to
              disable this flag.

           At most one of these can be specified:

             --use-table-schema
                Whether or not to use the BigQuery table schema when writing
                messages to BigQuery. Use --no-use-table-schema to disable this
                flag.

             --use-topic-schema
                Whether or not to use the schema for the subscription's topic
                (if it exists) when writing messages to BigQuery. If
                --drop-unknown-fields is not set, then the BigQuery schema must
                contain all fields that are present in the topic schema. Use
                --no-use-topic-schema to disable this flag.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --clear-cloud-storage-config
            If set, clear the Cloud Storage config from the subscription. Use
            --no-clear-cloud-storage-config to disable this flag.

         Cloud Storage Config Options. The Cloud Pub/Sub service account
         associated with the enclosing subscription's parent project (i.e.,
         service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must
         have permission to write to this Cloud Storage bucket and to read this
         bucket's metadata.

         When updating CloudStorageConfig flags, all CloudStorageConfig flags
         must be specified. Otherwise, any omitted CloudStorageConfig flags
         revert to their default value.

         Note that an update to the Cloud Storage config will replace it with a
         new config containing only the flags that are passed in the update
         CLI.

           --cloud-storage-bucket=CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET
              A Cloud Storage bucket to which to write messages for this

              before a new file is created. The value must be between 1000B and
              10GB. If the unit is omitted, KB is assumed.

           --cloud-storage-max-duration=CLOUD_STORAGE_MAX_DURATION
              The maximum duration that can elapse before a new Cloud Storage
              file is created. The value must be between 1m and 10m. Valid
              values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one
              of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days,
              respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed.

           --cloud-storage-max-messages=CLOUD_STORAGE_MAX_MESSAGES

              publish_time, attributes, and ordering_key as additional fields
              in the output. The subscription name, message_id, and
              publish_time fields are put in their own fields while all other
              message properties other than data (for example, an ordering_key,
              if present) are added as entries in the attributes map. This has
              an effect only for subscriptions with
              --cloud-storage-output-format=avro. Use

              This flag argument must be specified if any of the other
              arguments in this group are specified.

           --push-no-wrapper-write-metadata
              When true, writes the Pub/Sub message metadata to
              x-goog-pubsub-<KEY>:<VAL> headers of the HTTP request. Writes the
              Pub/Sub message attributes to <KEY>:<VAL> headers of the HTTP
              request. Use --no-push-no-wrapper-write-metadata to disable this
