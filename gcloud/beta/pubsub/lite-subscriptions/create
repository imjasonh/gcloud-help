REQUIRED FLAGS
     --topic=TOPIC
        Topic ID associated with the subscription.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --delivery-requirement=DELIVERY_REQUIREMENT; default="deliver-immediately"
        When this subscription should send messages to subscribers relative to
        messages persistence in storage. See
        https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/lite/docs/subscriptions#creating_lite_subscriptions
        for more info. DELIVERY_REQUIREMENT must be one of:
        deliver-after-stored, deliver-immediately.

     Location resource - Identifies the Cloud zone this command will be
     executed on. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are
     not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --zone on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location or fully qualified identifier for the location. To
          set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ provide the argument --zone on the command line.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --event-time=EVENT_TIME
          The event time to which you seek a subscription. The subscription
          seeks to the first message with event time greater than or equal to
          the specified event time. Messages missing an event time use publish
          time as a fallback. As event times are user supplied, subsequent
          messages may have event times less than the specified event time and
          must be filtered by the client, if necessary. Run $ gcloud topic
          datetimes for information on time formats.

       --publish-time=PUBLISH_TIME
          The publish time to which you seek a subscription. Messages with
          publish time greater than or equal to the specified time are
          delivered after the seek operation. Run $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on time formats.

       --starting-offset=STARTING_OFFSET; default="end"
          The offset at which a newly created or seeked subscription starts
          receiving messages. A subscription can be initialized at the offset
          of the oldest retained message (beginning), or at the current HEAD
          offset (end). STARTING_OFFSET must be one of: beginning, end.

     --export-pubsub-topic=EXPORT_PUBSUB_TOPIC
        The name of the destination Pub/Sub topic to which messages are
        exported. Must be the topic's fully specified path if it is not in the
        same project as the subscription to be created.

     --export-dead-letter-topic=EXPORT_DEAD_LETTER_TOPIC
        The name of the Pub/Sub Lite topic to write messages that cannot be
        exported. Must be in the same project and location as the subscription
        to be created. Note that this is a Lite topic.

     --export-desired-state=EXPORT_DESIRED_STATE; default="active"
        The desired state of the export. Process messages by setting the value
        to ACTIVE or pause message processing by setting the value to PAUSED.
        EXPORT_DESIRED_STATE must be one of: active, paused.
