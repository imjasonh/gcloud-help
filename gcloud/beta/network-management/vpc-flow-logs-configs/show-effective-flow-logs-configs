NAME
    gcloud beta network-management vpc-flow-logs-configs
        show-effective-flow-logs-configs - show all effective VPC Flow Logs
        configurations for a resource

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta network-management vpc-flow-logs-configs
        show-effective-flow-logs-configs --location=LOCATION
        --resource=RESOURCE [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Shows all effective VPC Flow Logs configurations for a resource. The
    effective configurations include all configurations that apply to the
    resource, including inherited ones from parent resources.

EXAMPLES
    To show all effective VPC Flow Logs configurations for a network my-network
    in project my-project, run:

        $ gcloud beta network-management vpc-flow-logs-configs \
          show-effective-flow-logs-configs --location=global \
          --resource="projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network"

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Location resource - The parent resource of the VpcFlowLogsConfig,
     specified in the following format: projects/{project_id}/locations/global
     This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location or fully qualified identifier for the location.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

     --resource=RESOURCE
        The resource to get the effective VPC Flow Logs configuration for. The
        resource must belong to the same project as the parent. The resource
        must be a network, subnetwork, interconnect attachment, VPN tunnel, or
        a project.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
