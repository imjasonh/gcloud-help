DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update an existing connectivity test with the given name.

EXAMPLES
    The following command updates a connectivity test with the name my-test,
    modifying the description and destination IP address.

        $ gcloud beta network-management connectivity-tests update my-test \
            --description='update dst addr' \
            --destination-ip-address='10.142.0.3'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Connectivity test resource - Name of the connectivity test you want to
     update. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument connectivity_test on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CONNECTIVITY_TEST
          ID of the connectivity test or fully qualified identifier for the
          connectivity test.

          To set the connectivity_test attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument connectivity_test on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --bypass-firewall-checks
        This boolean controls whether to skip firewall checking. Use
        --no-bypass-firewall-checks to disable.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        The description of the connectivity test.

     --destination-fqdn=DESTINATION_FQDN
        A hostname as the destination endpoint. Only applicable for Google
        Kubernetes Engine.

     --destination-network=DESTINATION_NETWORK
        A VPC network URI for the destination endpoint. Used only when the
        source is an external IP address endpoint, and the destination is an
        internal IP address endpoint.

     --destination-port=DESTINATION_PORT
        The IP protocol port of the destination. Only applicable when protocol
        is TCP or UDP.

     --destination-project=DESTINATION_PROJECT
        Project ID of the destination endpoint.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

     --other-projects=[OTHER_PROJECTS,...]
        IDs of other projects involved in the connectivity test, besides the
        source and destination project.

     --protocol=PROTOCOL
        Type of protocol for the test. When not provided, "TCP" is assumed.

     --round-trip
        This boolean controls whether return traces (from the destination to
        the source) will be additionally calculated if packet successfully
        reaches the destination from the source. Use --no-round-trip to
        disable.

     --source-network=SOURCE_NETWORK
        A VPC network URI for the source endpoint. Used according to the
        source-network-type flag.

     --source-network-type=SOURCE_NETWORK_TYPE; default="unspecified"
        Type of the network where the source is located. SOURCE_NETWORK_TYPE
        must be one of:

         gcp-network
            A VPC network. Should be used for internal IP addresses in VPC
            networks. The source-network field should be set to the URI of this
            network. Only endpoints within this network will be considered.
         internet
            Internet. Should be used for internet-routable external IP
            addresses or IP addresses for global Google APIs and services.
         non-gcp-network
            A network outside of Google Cloud (for example, an on-premises
            network or another cloud provider network). Should be used for
            internal IP addresses outside of Google Cloud. The source-network
            field should be set to the URI of the VPC network containing a
            corresponding Cloud VPN tunnel, Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachment,
            or a router appliance instance. Only endpoints reachable from the
            provided VPC network via the routes to networks outside of Google
            Cloud will be considered.
         unspecified
            Unspecified. The test will analyze all possible IP address
            locations. This might take longer and produce inaccurate or
            ambiguous results, so prefer specifying an explicit network type.
            The source-project field should be set to the project where the
            Google Cloud endpoint is located, or where the endpoint outside of
            Google Cloud should be reachable from (via routes to networks
            outside of Google Cloud). The project might also be inferred from
            the Connectivity Test project or other projects referenced in the
            request.
