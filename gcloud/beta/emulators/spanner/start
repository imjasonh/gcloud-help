NAME
    gcloud beta emulators spanner start - start a local Cloud Spanner emulator

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta emulators spanner start
        [--enable-fault-injection=ENABLE_FAULT_INJECTION]
        [--host-port=HOST_PORT] [--rest-port=REST_PORT]
        [--use-docker=USE_DOCKER] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command starts a local Cloud Spanner emulator.

EXAMPLES
    To start a local Cloud Spanner emulator, run:

        $ gcloud beta emulators spanner start

FLAGS
     --enable-fault-injection=ENABLE_FAULT_INJECTION
        If true, the emulator will randomly inject faults into transactions.
        This facilitates application abort-retry testing.

     --host-port=HOST_PORT
        The host:port to which the emulator should be bound. The default value
        is localhost:9010. Note that this port serves gRPC requests. To
        override the default port serving REST requests, use --rest-port. If
        using Docker to run the emulator, the host must be specified as an
        ipaddress.

     --rest-port=REST_PORT
        The port at which REST requests are served. gcloud uses REST to
        communicate with the emulator. The default value is 9020.

     --use-docker=USE_DOCKER
        Use the Cloud Spanner emulator docker image even if the platform has a
        native binary available in the gcloud CLI. Currently we only provide a
        native binary for Linux. For other systems, you must install Docker for
        your platform before starting the emulator.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
