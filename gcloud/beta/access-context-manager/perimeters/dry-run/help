NAME
    gcloud beta access-context-manager perimeters dry-run - enable management
        of dry-run mode configuration for Service Perimeters

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta access-context-manager perimeters dry-run COMMAND
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) A Service Perimeter describes a set of Google Cloud Platform
    resources which can freely import and export data amongst themselves, but
    not externally, by default.

        A dry-run mode configuration (also known as the Service Perimeter
        `spec`) makes it possible to understand the impact of any changes to a
        VPC Service Controls policy change before committing the change to the
        enforcement mode configuration.

        Note: For Service Perimeters without an explicit dry-run mode
        configuration, the enforcement mode configuration is used as the dry-run
        mode configuration, resulting in no audit logs being generated.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
