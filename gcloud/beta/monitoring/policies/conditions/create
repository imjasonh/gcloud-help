DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a condition in an alerting policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Alert Policy resource - Name of the Alert Policy to add a condition to.
     This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument alert_policy on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       ALERT_POLICY
          ID of the Alert Policy or fully qualified identifier for the Alert
          Policy.

          To set the policy attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument alert_policy on the command line.

FLAGS
     Condition Settings. This will add a condition to the created policy. If
     any conditions are already specified, this condition will be appended.

       --aggregation=AGGREGATION
          Specifies an Aggregation message as a JSON/YAML value to be applied
          to the condition. For more information about the format:

       --condition-display-name=CONDITION_DISPLAY_NAME
          The display name for the condition.

       --condition-filter=CONDITION_FILTER
          Specifies the "filter" in a metric absence or metric threshold
          condition.

       --duration=DURATION
          The duration (e.g. "60s", "2min", etc.) that the condition must hold
          in order to trigger as true.

       --if=IF_VALUE
          One of "absent", "< THRESHOLD", "> THRESHOLD" where "THRESHOLD" is an
          integer or float.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --trigger-count=TRIGGER_COUNT
            The absolute number of time series that must fail the predicate for
            the condition to be triggered.

         --trigger-percent=TRIGGER_PERCENT
            The percentage of time series that must fail the predicate for the
            condition to be triggered.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --condition=CONDITION
          The condition as a string. In either JSON or YAML format.

       --condition-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          The path to a JSON or YAML file containing the condition. Use a full
          or relative path to a local file containing the value of condition.
