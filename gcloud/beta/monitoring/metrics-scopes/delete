DESCRIPTION

EXAMPLES
    The following command adds a monitored project with the ID
    monitored-project-1 to a metrics scope with project id metrics-scope-1
    assuming the metrics-scope-1 is the default project:

        $ gcloud beta monitoring metrics-scopes delete monitored-project-1

    The following command adds a monitored project with the ID
    monitored-project-1 to a metrics scope with project id metrics-scope-1:

        $ gcloud beta monitoring metrics-scopes delete monitored-project-1 \
            --project=metrics-scope-1
        $ gcloud beta monitoring metrics-scopes delete \
            locations/global/metricsScopes/metrics-scope-1/projects/\
        monitored-project-1
