NAME
    gcloud beta monitoring metrics-scopes create - create a monitored project
        in a metrics scope

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta monitoring metrics-scopes create
        MONITORED_RESOURCE_CONTAINER_NAME [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The projects specified do not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access one of the
        given project.
      ▪ The monitored project already exists in the metrics scope.

EXAMPLES
    The following command adds a monitored project with the ID
    monitored-project-1 to a metrics scope with project id metrics-scope-1
    assuming the metrics-scope-1 is the default project:

        $ gcloud beta monitoring metrics-scopes create \
            projects/monitored-project-1

    The following command adds a monitored project with the ID
    monitored-project-1 to a metrics scope with project id metrics-scope-1:

        $ gcloud beta monitoring metrics-scopes create \
            projects/monitored-project-1 --project=metrics-scope-1
        $ gcloud beta monitoring metrics-scopes create \
            locations/global/metricsScopes/metrics-scope-1/projects/\
        monitored-project-1
