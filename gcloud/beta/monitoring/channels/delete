NAME
    gcloud beta monitoring channels delete - delete a notification channel

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta monitoring channels delete CHANNEL [--force]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Delete a notification channel.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will delete channel
    projects/12345/notificationChannels/67890, but only if the channel is not
    actively referenced by existing alerting policies:

        $ gcloud beta monitoring channels delete \
            "projects/12345/notificationChannels/67890"

    The following command will delete channel
    projects/12345/notificationChannels/67890, even if the channel is still
    actively referenced by alerting policies; if an existing policy references
    the channel, it will be modified as a side-effect to remove the channel.

        $ gcloud beta monitoring channels delete \
            "projects/12345/notificationChannels/67890" --force

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Notification channel resource - The notification channel to delete. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument channel on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CHANNEL
          ID of the notification_channel or fully qualified identifier for the
          notification_channel.

          To set the channel attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument channel on the command line.

FLAGS
     --force
        If true, the notification channel will be deleted regardless of its use
        in alerting policies (the policies will be updated to remove the
        channel).
