NAME
    gcloud beta resource-manager capabilities update - update a folder
        capability

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta resource-manager capabilities update CAPABILITY_ID
        --[no-]enable [--update-mask=UPDATE_MASK] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Command to Update/Set the value field of the Folder capability. This
    can be done by using the --enable flag to set the value to True, and the
    --no-enable flag to set the value to False.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ There is no folder parenting the given capability name.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to update the given
        folder/capability.

EXAMPLES
    The following command updates a capability with the ID
    folders/123/capabilities/app-management to have the value True:

        $ gcloud beta resource-manager capabilities update \
            "folders/123/capabilities/app-management" --enable

    In order to set the value to False, the following command can be used:

        $ gcloud beta resource-manager capabilities update \
            "folders/123/capabilities/app-management" --no-enable
