NAME
    gcloud beta tasks queues create-pull-queue - create a pull queue

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta tasks queues create-pull-queue QUEUE [--location=LOCATION]
        [--max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS] [--max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) The flags available to this command represent the fields of a pull
    queue that are mutable.

    If you have early access to Cloud Tasks, refer to the following guide for
    more information about the different queue target types:
    https://cloud.google.com/cloud-tasks/docs/queue-types. For access, sign up
    here: https://goo.gl/Ya0AZd

EXAMPLES
    To create a Cloud Tasks pull queue:

        $ gcloud beta tasks queues create-pull-queue my-queue
        --max-attempts=10 --max-retry-duration=10s

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     QUEUE
        The queue to create.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        The location where we want to manage the queue or task. If not
        specified, uses the location of the current project's App Engine app if
        there is an associated app.

     --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS
        The maximum number of attempts per task in the queue.

     --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
        The time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task
        was first run. Once the --max-retry-duration time has passed and the
        task has been attempted --max-attempts times, no further attempts will
        be made and the task will be deleted.

        Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
