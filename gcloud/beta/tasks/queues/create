DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) The flags available to this command represent the fields of a queue
    that are mutable.

EXAMPLES
    To create a Cloud Tasks queue:

        $ gcloud beta tasks queues create my-queue --max-attempts=10 \
          --max-retry-duration=5s --max-doublings=4 --min-backoff=1s \
          --max-backoff=10s --max-dispatches-per-second=100 \
          --max-concurrent-dispatches=10 --routing-override=service:abc

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     QUEUE
        The queue to create.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        The location where we want to manage the queue or task. If not
        specified, uses the location of the current project's App Engine app if
        there is an associated app.

     --log-sampling-ratio=LOG_SAMPLING_RATIO
        Specifies the fraction of operations to write to Cloud Logging. This
        field may contain any value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. 0.0 is the
        default and means that no operations are logged.

     --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS
        The maximum number of attempts per task in the queue.

     --max-backoff=MAX_BACKOFF
        The maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it
        fails. Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     --max-concurrent-dispatches=MAX_CONCURRENT_DISPATCHES
        The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be
        dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached, Cloud
        Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of outstanding requests
        decreases.

     --max-dispatches-per-second=MAX_DISPATCHES_PER_SECOND
        The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.

     --max-doublings=MAX_DOUBLINGS
        The time between retries will double maxDoublings times.

        A tasks retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles maxDoublings
        times, then increases linearly, and finally retries retries at
        intervals of maxBackoff up to maxAttempts times.

        For example, if minBackoff is 10s, maxBackoff is 300s, and maxDoublings
        is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval
        will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s.
        Finally, the task will retry at intervals of maxBackoff until the task
        has been attempted maxAttempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at
        10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s.

     --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
        The time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task
        was first run. Once the --max-retry-duration time has passed and the
        task has been attempted --max-attempts times, no further attempts will
        be made and the task will be deleted.

        Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     --min-backoff=MIN_BACKOFF
        The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it
        fails. Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     --routing-override=KEY:VALUE,[...]
        If provided, the specified route is used for all tasks in the queue, no
        matter what is set is at the task-level.

        KEY must be at least one of: [service, version, instance]. Any missing
        keys will use the default.

     --type=TYPE; default="push"
        Specifies the type of queue. Only available options are 'push' and
        'pull'. The default option is 'push'.
