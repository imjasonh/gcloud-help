SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta healthcare fhir-stores create
        (FHIR_STORE : --dataset=DATASET --location=LOCATION)
        [--disable-referential-integrity] [--disable-resource-versioning]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Creates a Cloud Healthcare API FHIR store.

EXAMPLES
    To create a FHIR store called 'test-fhir-store', run:

        $ gcloud beta healthcare fhir-stores create test-fhir-store \
            --dataset=test-dataset --version=r4

    To create a fhir store with the Cloud Pub/Sub topic 'test-pubsub-topic',
    run:

        $ gcloud beta healthcare fhir-stores create test-fhir-store \
            --dataset=test-dataset --version=r4 \
            --pubsub-topic=projects/my-project/topics/test-pubsub-topic

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FhirStore resource - Cloud Healthcare API FHIR store to create. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument fhir_store on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       FHIR_STORE
          ID of the fhirStore or fully qualified identifier for the fhirStore.

          To set the fhir_store attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument fhir_store on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --dataset=DATASET
          Cloud Healthcare dataset.

          To set the dataset attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument fhir_store on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --dataset on the command line.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument fhir_store on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property healthcare/location.

FLAGS
     --disable-referential-integrity
        Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. Default
        value is false, meaning that the API will enforce referential integrity
        and fail the requests that will result in inconsistent state in the
        FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API will skip
        referential integrity check. This field is immutable after store
        creation.

     --disable-resource-versioning
        Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. If set to
        false, which is the default behavior, all write operations will cause
        historical versions to be recorded automatically. Historical versions
        can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. This
        field is immutable after store creation.

     --enable-update-create
        Whether this FHIR store has the [updateCreate]
        (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.updateCreate)
        capability. Determines if the client can use an Update operation to
        create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are
        server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to Update a
        non-existent resource will return errors.

     --pubsub-topic=PUBSUB_TOPIC
        Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic to send updates to.

        Note, a topic needs to be created before publishing or subscribing to
        it. For instructions on creating topics, refer to:
        https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#create_a_topic

     --version=VERSION
        The FHIR specification version that this FHIR store supports natively.
        This field is immutable after store creation. Requests are rejected if
        they contain FHIR resources of a different version. An empty value is
        treated as STU3. VERSION must be one of:

         dstu2
            Draft Standard for Trial Use, Release 2
            (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2)

         r4
            Release 4 (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4)

         stu3
            Standard for Trial Use, Release 3 (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3)
