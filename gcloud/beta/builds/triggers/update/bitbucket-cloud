            --branch-pattern=".*"

    To update the build config of the trigger:

        $ gcloud beta builds triggers update bitbucket-cloud my-trigger \

        connections/my-conn/repositories/my-repo

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Trigger resource - Build Trigger. The arguments in this group can be used
     to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument TRIGGER on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       TRIGGER
          ID of the trigger or fully qualified identifier for the trigger.

          To set the trigger attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument TRIGGER on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud location for the trigger.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument TRIGGER on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property builds/region.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --trigger-config=PATH
          Path to Build Trigger config file (JSON or YAML format). For more
          details, see
          https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/projects.triggers#BuildTrigger

       Flag based trigger configuration

         --description=DESCRIPTION
            Build trigger description.

         --ignored-files=[GLOB,...]
            Glob filter. Changes only affecting ignored files won't trigger
            builds.

         --included-files=[GLOB,...]
            Glob filter. Changes affecting at least one included file will
            trigger builds.

         --repository=REPOSITORY
            Repository resource (2nd gen) to use, in the format
            "projects/*/locations/*/connections/*/repositories/".

         --[no-]require-approval
            Require manual approval for triggered builds. Use
            --require-approval to enable and --no-require-approval to disable.

         --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
            The service account used for all user-controlled operations
            including UpdateBuildTrigger, RunBuildTrigger, CreateBuild, and
            CancelBuild. If no service account is set, then the standard Cloud
            Build service account ([PROJECT_NUM]@system.gserviceaccount.com) is
            used instead. Format:
            projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT_ID_OR_EMAIL}.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --branch-pattern=REGEX
              A regular expression specifying which git branches to match.

              This pattern is used as a regular expression search for any
              incoming pushes. For example, --branch-pattern=foo will match
              "foo", "foobar", and "barfoo". Events on a branch that does not
              match will be ignored.

              The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is the syntax
              accepted by RE2 and described at
              https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax.

           --tag-pattern=REGEX
              A regular expression specifying which git tags to match.

              This pattern is used as a regular expression search for any
              incoming pushes. For example, --tag-pattern=foo will match "foo",
              "foobar", and "barfoo". Events on a tag that does not match will
              be ignored.

              The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is the syntax
              accepted by RE2 and described at
              https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax.

           Pull Request settings

             --comment-control=COMMENT_CONTROL
                Require a repository collaborator or owner to comment '/gcbrun'
                on a pull request before running the build. COMMENT_CONTROL
                must be one of:

                 COMMENTS_DISABLED
                    Do not require comments on Pull Requests before builds are
                    triggered.
                 COMMENTS_ENABLED
                    Enforce that repository owners or collaborators must
                    comment on Pull Requests before builds are triggered.
                 COMMENTS_ENABLED_FOR_EXTERNAL_CONTRIBUTORS_ONLY
                    Enforce that repository owners or collaborators must
                    comment on external contributors' Pull Requests before
                    builds are triggered.

             --pull-request-pattern=REGEX
                A regular expression specifying which base git branch to match
                for pull request events.

                This pattern is used as a regular expression search for the
                base branch (the branch you are trying to merge into) for pull
                request updates. For example, --pull-request-pattern=foo will
                match "foo", "foobar", and "barfoo".

                The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is the syntax
                accepted by RE2 and described at
                https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --build-config=PATH
              Path to a YAML or JSON file containing the build configuration in
              the repository.

              For more details, see:
              https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/build-config

           --inline-config=PATH
              Local path to a YAML or JSON file containing a build
              configuration.

           Dockerfile build configuration flags

             --dockerfile=DOCKERFILE
                Path of Dockerfile to use for builds in the repository.

                If specified, a build config will be generated to run docker
                build using the specified file.

                The filename is relative to the Dockerfile directory.

                This flag argument must be specified if any of the other
                arguments in this group are specified.

             --dockerfile-image=DOCKERFILE_IMAGE
                Docker image name to build.

                This flag argument must be specified if any of the other
                arguments in this group are specified.

             --dockerfile-dir=DOCKERFILE_DIR
                Location of the directory containing the Dockerfile in the
                repository.

                The directory will also be used as the Docker build context.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --clear-substitutions
              Clear existing substitutions.

           --remove-substitutions=[KEY,...]
              Remove existing substitutions if present.

           --update-substitutions=[KEY=VALUE,...]
              Update or add to existing substitutions. Substitutions are
              parameters to be substituted or add in the build specification.

              For example (using some nonsensical substitution keys; all keys
              must begin with an underscore):

                  $ gcloud builds triggers update ...
                      --update-substitutions _FAVORITE_COLOR=blue,_NUM_CANDIES=10

              This will add the provided substitutions to the existing
              substitutions and results in a build where every occurrence of
              ${_FAVORITE_COLOR} in certain fields is replaced by "blue", and
              similarly for ${_NUM_CANDIES} and "10".

              Only the following built-in variables can be specified with the
              --substitutions flag: REPO_NAME, BRANCH_NAME, TAG_NAME,
              REVISION_ID, COMMIT_SHA, SHORT_SHA.

              For more details, see:
              https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-config-file-schema#substitutions
