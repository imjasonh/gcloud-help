NAME
    gcloud beta builds worker-pools create - create a worker pool for use by
        Cloud Build

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta builds worker-pools create WORKER_POOL --region=REGION
        [--config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE | --peered-network=PEERED_NETWORK
          --peered-network-ip-range=PEERED_NETWORK_IP_RANGE --no-public-egress
          --worker-disk-size=WORKER_DISK_SIZE
          --worker-machine-type=WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a worker pool for use by Cloud Build.

EXAMPLES
    To create a worker pool named wp1 in region us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud beta builds worker-pools create wp1 --region=us-central1

    To create a worker pool in project p1 in region us-central1 where workers
    are of machine type e2-standard-2 and are peered to the VPC network
    projects/123/global/networks/default within the IP range 192.168.0.0/28 and
    have a disk size of 64GB, run:

        $ gcloud beta builds worker-pools create wp1 --project=p1 \
            --region=us-central1 \
            --peered-network=projects/123/global/networks/default \
            --peered-network-ip-range=192.168.0.0/28 \
            --worker-machine-type=e2-standard-2 --worker-disk-size=64GB

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     WORKER_POOL
        Unique identifier for the worker pool to create. This value should be
        1-63 characters, and valid characters are [a-z][0-9]-

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud region where the worker pool is created. See
        https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/locations for available locations.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE
          File that contains the configuration for the worker pool to be
          created. See
          https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/worker-pool-config-file-schema
          for options.

       Command-line flags to configure the private pool:

         --peered-network=PEERED_NETWORK
            Existing network to which workers are peered. The network is
            specified in resource URL format
            projects/{network_project}/global/networks/{network_name}.

            If not specified, the workers are not peered to any network.

         --peered-network-ip-range=PEERED_NETWORK_IP_RANGE
            An IP range for your peered network. Specify the IP range using
            Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation with a slash and the
            subnet prefix size, such as /29.

            Your subnet prefix size must be between 1 and 29. Optional: you can
            specify an IP address before the subnet prefix value - for example
            192.168.0.0/24.

            If no IP address is specified, your VPC automatically determines
            the starting IP for the range. If no IP range is specified, Cloud
            Build uses /24 as the default network IP range.

         --no-public-egress
            If set, workers in the worker pool are created without an external
            IP address.

            If the worker pool is within a VPC Service Control perimeter, use
            this flag.

         Configuration to be used for creating workers in the worker pool:

           --worker-disk-size=WORKER_DISK_SIZE
              Size of the disk attached to the worker.

              If not given, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.

           --worker-machine-type=WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE
              Compute Engine machine type for a worker pool.

              If unspecified, Cloud Build uses a standard machine type.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
