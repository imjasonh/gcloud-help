    gcloud beta builds describe - get information about a particular build

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta builds describe BUILD [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Get information about a particular build.

EXAMPLES
    To describe a build 123-456-789:

        $ gcloud beta builds describe '123-456-789'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BUILD
        The build to describe. The ID of the build is printed at the end of the
        build submission process, or in the ID column when listing builds.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        The region of the Cloud Build Service to use. Must be set to a
        supported region name (e.g. us-central1). If unset, builds/region,
        which is the default region to use when working with Cloud Build
        resources, is used. If builds/region is unset, region is set to global.
        Note: Region must be specified in 2nd gen repo; global is not
        supported.
