DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a Cloud Scheduler job that triggers an action via HTTP.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a job that sends a HTTP GET request to
    'http://example.com/path' every 3 hours:

        $ gcloud beta scheduler jobs create http my-job \
            --schedule="0 */3 * * *"
          --uri="http://example.com/path" --http-method=GET

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Job resource - Job to create. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument job on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       JOB
          ID of the job or fully qualified identifier for the job. To set the
          job attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument job on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the job. By default, uses the location of the current
          project's App Engine app if there is an associated app.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument job on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ defaults to App Engine's app location if not provided & an app
            exists.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --schedule=SCHEDULE
        Schedule on which the job will be executed.

        As a general rule, execution n + 1 of a job will not begin until
        execution n has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two
        simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that
        if the n+1 execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the n execution
        takes until 16:15, the n+1 execution will not start until 16:15. A
        scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not
        ended when its scheduled time occurs.

        If --retry-count > 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a
        total of --retry-count times, with exponential backoff, until the next
        scheduled start time.

        The schedule can be either of the following types:
        ◆ Crontab: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview
        ◆ English-like schedule:
          https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/quickstart#defining_the_job_schedule

     --uri=URI
        The full URI path that the request will be sent to. This string must
        begin with either "http://" or "https://". For example, http://acme.com
        or https://acme.com/sales:8080. Cloud Scheduler will encode some
        characters for safety and compatibility. The maximum allowed URL length
        is 2083 characters after encoding.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --attempt-deadline=ATTEMPT_DEADLINE
        The deadline for job attempts. If the request handler doesn't respond
        by this dealine, the request is cancelled and the attempt is marked as
        failed. For example, 20s.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable description of the job.

     --headers=HEADERS
        KEY=VALUE pairs of HTTP headers to include in the request. Cannot be
        repeated. For example: --headers
        Accept-Language=en-us,Accept=text/plain

     --http-method=HTTP_METHOD; default="post"
        HTTP method to use for the request. HTTP_METHOD must be one of: delete,
        get, head, post, put.

     --max-backoff=MAX_BACKOFF; default="1h"
        Maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it fails.
        For example, 10m. Default is 1h.

     --max-doublings=MAX_DOUBLINGS; default=16
        Maximum number of times that the interval between failed job retries
        will be doubled before the increase becomes constant.

     --max-retry-attempts=MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS
        Number of times to retry the request if it fails or times out. Must be
        in range 0-5 inclusive. Default is 0.

     --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
        Time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was
        first run. If specified with --max-retry-attempts greater than 0, the
        task will be retried until both limits are reached. Default is 0 (which
        means unlimited).

     --min-backoff=MIN_BACKOFF; default="5s"
        Minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it fails.
        For example, 10s. Default is 5s.

     --time-zone=TIME_ZONE; default="Etc/UTC"
        Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting --schedule. The
        value of this field must be a time zone name from the tz database
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

        Note that some time zones include a provision for daylight savings
        time. The rules for daylight saving time are determined by the chosen
        time zone.

        For UTC use the string "utc". Default is "utc".

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --message-body=MESSAGE_BODY
          Data payload to be included as the body of the HTTP request. May only
          be given with compatible HTTP methods (PUT or POST).

       --message-body-from-file=MESSAGE_BODY_FROM_FILE
          Path to file containing the data payload to be included as the body
          of the HTTP request. May only be given with compatible HTTP methods
          (PUT or POST).

     How the request sent to the target when executing the job should be
     authenticated.

    At most one of these can be specified:

       OAuth2

         --oauth-service-account-email=OAUTH_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
            The service account email to be used for generating an OAuth2
            access token to be included in the request sent to the target when
            executing the job. The service account must be within the same
            project as the job. The caller must have iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
            permission for the service account. The token must be OAuth if the
            target is a Google APIs service with URL *.googleapis.com.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --oauth-token-scope=OAUTH_TOKEN_SCOPE
            The scope to be used when generating an OAuth2 access token to be
            included in the request sent to the target when executing the job.
            If not specified, "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"
            will be used.

       OpenId Connect

         --oidc-service-account-email=OIDC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
            The service account email to be used for generating an OpenId
            Connect token to be included in the request sent to the target when
            executing the job. The service account must be within the same
            project as the job. The caller must have iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
            permission for the service account. The OIDC token is generally
            used except for Google APIs hosted on *.googleapis.com: these APIs
            expect an OAuth token.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --oidc-token-audience=OIDC_TOKEN_AUDIENCE
            The audience to be used when generating an OpenId Connect token to
            be included in the request sent to the target when executing the
            job. If not specified, the URI specified in target will be used.
