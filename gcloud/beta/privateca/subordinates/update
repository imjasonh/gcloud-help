NAME
    gcloud beta privateca subordinates update - update an existing subordinate
        certificate authority

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta privateca subordinates update
        (CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY : --location=LOCATION)
        [--issuance-policy=ISSUANCE_POLICY] [--pem-chain=PEM_CHAIN]
        [--no-publish-ca-cert] [--no-publish-crl]
        [--update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--clear-labels | --remove-labels=[KEY,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

EXAMPLES
    To update labels on a subordinate CA:

        $ gcloud beta privateca subordinates update server-tls-1 \
          --location=us-west1 \
          --update-labels=foo=bar

    To disable publishing CRLs for a subordinate CA:

        $ gcloud beta privateca subordinates update server-tls-1 \
          --location=us-west1 \
          --no-publish-crl

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY resource - The certificate authority to update. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY
          ID of the CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY or fully qualified identifier for the
          CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY. To set the certificate_authority attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY. To set the location
          attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY on the command line
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property privateca/location.

FLAGS
     --issuance-policy=ISSUANCE_POLICY
        A YAML file describing this Certificate Authority's issuance policy.

     --pem-chain=PEM_CHAIN
        A file containing a list of PEM-encoded certificates that represent the
        issuing chain of this CA.

     --publish-ca-cert
        If this is enabled, the following will happen: 1) The CA certificate
        will be written to a known location within the CA distribution point.
        2) The AIA extension in all issued certificates will point to the CA
        cert URL in that distribution point.

        If this gets disabled, the AIA extension will not be written to any
        future certificates issued by this CA. However, an existing bucket will
        not be deleted, and the CA certificate will not be removed from that
        bucket.

        Note that the same bucket may be used for the CRLs if --publish-crl is
        set.

        Enabled by default, use --no-publish-ca-cert to disable.

     --publish-crl
        If this gets enabled, the following will happen: 1) CRLs will be
        written to a known location within the CA distribution point. 2) The
        CDP extension in all future issued certificates will point to the CRL
        URL in that distribution point.

        If this gets disabled, the CDP extension will not be written to any
        future certificates issued by this CA, and new CRLs will not be
        published to that bucket (which affects existing certs). However, an
        existing bucket will not be deleted, and any existing CRLs will not be
        removed from that bucket.

        Note that the same bucket may be used for the CA cert if
        --publish-ca-cert is set.

        CRL publication is not supported for CAs in the DevOps tier.

        Enabled by default, use --no-publish-crl to disable.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud beta privateca subordinates update --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud beta privateca subordinates update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.
