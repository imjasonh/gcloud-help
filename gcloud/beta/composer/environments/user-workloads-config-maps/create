     This must be specified.

          environment.

          To set the environment attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --environment on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Region where Composer environment runs or in which to create the
          environment.

          To set the location attribute:
