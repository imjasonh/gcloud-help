NAME
    gcloud beta composer environments storage plugins import - import plugins
        from local storage or Cloud Storage into an environment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta composer environments storage plugins import --source=SOURCE
        (--environment=ENVIRONMENT : --location=LOCATION)
        [--destination=DESTINATION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) If the SOURCE is a directory, it and its contents are imported
    recursively. Colliding files in the environment's Cloud Storage bucket will
    be overwritten. If a file exists in the bucket but is not present in the
    SOURCE, it is not removed.

EXAMPLES
    Suppose the '/foo' directory in the local filesystem has the following
    structure:

        foo
        |
        +-- subdir1
        |   |
        |   +-- file1.txt
        |   +-- file2.txt
        |
        +-- subdir2
        |   |
        |   +-- file3.txt
        |   +-- file4.txt

    And the environment myenv's Cloud Storage bucket has the following
    structure:

        gs://the-bucket
        |
        +-- plugins
        |   |
        |   +-- foo
        |   |   |
        |   |   +-- subdir1
        |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   +-- bar.txt

    The following command:

        gcloud beta composer environments storage plugins import myenv --source=/foo

    would result in the following structure in myenv's Cloud Storage bucket:

        gs://the-bucket
        |
        +-- plugins
        |   |
        |   +-- foo
        |   |   |
        |   |   +-- subdir1
        |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   +-- bar.txt
        |   |   |   +-- file1.txt
        |   |   |   +-- file2.txt
        |   |   |
        |   |   +-- subdir2
        |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   +-- file3.txt
        |   |   |   +-- file4.txt

    If instead we had run

        gcloud beta composer environments storage plugins import myenv --source=/foo --destination=bar

    the resulting bucket structure would be the following:

        gs://the-bucket
        |
        +-- plugins
        |   |
        |   +-- foo
        |   |   |
        |   |   +-- subdir1
        |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   +-- bar.txt
        |   |
        |   +-- bar
        |   |   |
        |   |   +-- foo
        |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   +-- subdir1
        |   |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   |   +-- file1.txt
        |   |   |   |   +-- file2.txt
        |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   +-- subdir2
        |   |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   |   +-- file3.txt
        |   |   |   |   +-- file4.txt

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --source=SOURCE
        Path to a local directory/file or Cloud Storage bucket/object to be
        imported into the plugins/ subdirectory in the environment's Cloud
        Storage bucket. Cloud Storage paths must begin with 'gs://'.

     Environment resource - The environment into whose Cloud Storage bucket to
     import plugins.. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --environment on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       --environment=ENVIRONMENT
          ID of the environment or fully qualified identifier for the
          environment. To set the environment attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --environment on the command line.

          This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Region where Composer environment runs or in which to create the
          environment. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --environment on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property composer/location.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --destination=DESTINATION
        An optional subdirectory under the plugins/ directory in the
        environment's Cloud Storage bucket into which to import files. May
        contain forward slashes to delimit multiple levels of subdirectory
        nesting, but should not contain leading or trailing slashes. If the
        DESTINATION does not exist, it will be created.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud composer environments storage plugins import
