SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Check that upgrading a Cloud Composer environment does not result in
    PyPI module conflicts.

EXAMPLES
    To check that upgrading to the 'composer-1.16.5-airflow-1.10.15' image        in a Cloud Composer environment named 'env-1' does not cause
        PyPI package conflicts,
        run:

        $ gcloud beta composer environments check-upgrade env-1 \
            --image-version=composer-1.16.5-airflow-1.10.15

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Environment resource - The environment to check upgrade for. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.
     (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
     set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument environment on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       ENVIRONMENT
          ID of the environment or fully qualified identifier for the
          environment. To set the environment attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument environment on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Region where Composer environment runs or in which to create the
          environment. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument environment on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property composer/location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     Group of arguments for performing in-place environment upgrades.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --airflow-version=AIRFLOW_VERSION
          Upgrade the environment to a later Apache Airflow version in-place.

          Must be of the form X[.Y[.Z]], where [] denotes optional fragments.
          Examples: 2, 2.3, 2.3.4.

          The Apache Airflow version is a semantic version or an alias in the
          form of major or major.minor version numbers, resolved to the latest
          matching Apache Airflow version supported in the current Cloud
          Composer version. The resolved version is stored in the upgraded
          environment.

       --image-version=IMAGE_VERSION
          Upgrade the environment to a later version in-place.

          The image version encapsulates the versions of both Cloud Composer
          and Apache Airflow. Must be of the form
          composer-A[.B.C[-D.E]]-airflow-X[.Y[.Z]], where [] denotes optional
          fragments.

          Examples: composer-2-airflow-2, composer-2-airflow-2.2,
          composer-2.1.2-airflow-2.3.4.

          The Cloud Composer portion of the image version is a semantic version
          or an alias in the form of major version number or latest, resolved
          to the current Cloud Composer version. The Apache Airflow portion of
          the image version is a semantic version or an alias in the form of
          major or major.minor version numbers, resolved to the latest matching
          Apache Airflow version supported in the given Cloud Composer version.
          The resolved versions are stored in the upgraded environment.
