NAME
    gcloud beta redis clusters add-cluster-endpoints - add more cluster
        endpoints

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta redis clusters add-cluster-endpoints
        (CLUSTER : --region=REGION)
        --cluster-endpoint=[psc-connection=PSC-CONNECTION] [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This is required to enable multi-vpc for Redis cluster.

    To add one cluster endpoint to an existing Redis cluster, two PSC
    connections MUST be added as a pair: one for the Redis cluster's discovery
    service attachment and the other for the additional service attachment.

    Multiple cluster endpoints COULD be added simultaneously.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The cluster specified does not exist.
      ▪ The number of connections provided to a cluster endpoint are not in
        pairs.
      ▪ One of the connections is not found.

EXAMPLES
    To connect redis cluster to one additional VPC, run:

        $ gcloud beta redis clusters add-cluster-endpoints \
            my-redis-cluster add-cluster-endpoints \
            --cluster-endpoint='["psc-connection":[{"psc-connection-id":"$ID\
        ","address":"$IP","network":"projects/$PROJECT/global/networks/$NETW\
        ORK","forwarding-rule":"projects/$PROJECT/regions/us-east1/forwardin\
        gRules/$FR_NAME","service-attachment":"projects/$PROJECT/regions/$RE\
        GION/serviceAttachments/$SA_NAME"},{$ADDITIONAL_PSC_CONNECTION}]]' \
            --cluster_endpoint=$ADDITIONAL_CLUSTER_ENDPOINT \
            $PSCConnectionID SHOULD be extracted from forwarding rules. \
            E.g. 75311697652483351

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - Arguments and flags that specify the Memorystore Redis
     cluster you want to update. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

          To set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Redis region of the cluster. Overrides the default
          redis/region property value for this command invocation.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property redis/region.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --cluster-endpoint=[psc-connection=PSC-CONNECTION]
        Required, Resource details of a redis cluster endpoint.

         psc-connection
            Sets psc-connection value.

             address
                Sets address value.

             forwarding-rule
                Sets forwarding-rule value.

             network
                Sets network value.

             psc-connection-id
                Sets psc-connection-id value.

             service-attachment
                Sets service-attachment value.

        Shorthand Example:

            --cluster-endpoint='psc-connection=[{"address": "string", "forwarding-rule": "string", "network": "string", "psc-connection-id": "string", "service-attachment": "string"}]' --cluster-endpoint='psc-connection=[{"address": "string", "forwarding-rule": "string", "network": "string", "psc-connection-id": "string", "service-attachment": "string"}]'

        JSON Example:

            --cluster-endpoint='[{"psc-connection": [{"address": "string", "forwarding-rule": "string", "network": "string", "psc-connection-id": "string", "service-attachment": "string"}]}]'

        File Example:

            --cluster-endpoint=path_to_file.(yaml|json)

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
