DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Restore an AlloyDB cluster from a given backup or a source cluster
    and a timestamp.

EXAMPLES
    To restore a cluster from a backup, run:

        $ gcloud beta alloydb clusters restore my-cluster \
          --region=us-central1 --backup=my-backup

    To restore a cluster from a source cluster and a timestamp, run:

        $ gcloud beta alloydb clusters restore my-cluster \
          --region=us-central1 --source-cluster=old-cluster \
          --point-in-time=2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CLUSTER
        AlloyDB cluster ID

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Regional location (e.g. asia-east1, us-east1). See the full list of
        regions at https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/instance-locations.

     RestoreCluster source types.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --backup=BACKUP
          AlloyDB backup to restore from. This must either be the full backup
          name (projects/myProject/locations/us-central1/backups/myBackup) or
          the backup ID (myBackup). In the second case, the project and
          location are assumed to be the same as the restored cluster that is
          being created.

       --backupdr-backup=BACKUPDR_BACKUP
          Backup DR backup to restore from. This is a resource path of the form
          projects/myProject/locations/us-central1/backupVaults/myBackupVault/dataSources/myDataSource/backups/myBackup.

       Restore a cluster from a source cluster at a given point in time.

         --point-in-time=POINT_IN_TIME
            Point in time to restore to, in RFC 3339 format. For example,
            2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         Source for a point in time restore operation.

         Exactly one of these must be specified:

           --backupdr-data-source=BACKUPDR_DATA_SOURCE
              Backup DR data source to restore from. This is a resource path of
              the form
              projects/myProject/locations/us-central1/backupVaults/myBackupVault/dataSources/myDataSource.

           --source-cluster=SOURCE_CLUSTER
              AlloyDB source cluster to restore from. This must either be the
              full cluster name
              (projects/myProject/locations/us-central1/backups/myCluster) or
              the cluster ID (myCluster). In the second case, the project and
              location are assumed to be the same as the restored cluster that
              is being created.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --allocated-ip-range-name=ALLOCATED_IP_RANGE_NAME
        Name of the allocated IP range for the private IP AlloyDB cluster, for
        example: "google-managed-services-default". If set, the instance IPs
        for this cluster will be created in the allocated range. The range name
        must comply with RFC 1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
        characters long and match the regular expression
        [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --enable-private-service-connect
        Enable Private Service Connect (PSC) connectivity for the cluster.

     --network=NETWORK
        Network in the current project that the instance will be part of. To
        specify using a network with a shared VPC, use the full URL of the
        network. For an example host project, testproject, and shared network,
        testsharednetwork, this would be of the
        form:--network=projects/testproject/global/networks/testsharednetwork

     --tags=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of tags KEY=VALUE pairs to bind. Each item must be expressed as
        <tag-key-namespaced-name>=<tag-value-short-name>.

        Example: 123/environment=production,123/costCenter=marketing

     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the cluster. The 'AlloyDB Service Agent' service
     account must hold permission 'Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter'.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource.

       --kms-key=KMS_KEY
          ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key.

          To set the kms-key attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-key on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --kms-keyring=KMS_KEYRING
          The KMS keyring of the key.

          To set the kms-keyring attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-key on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-keyring on the command line.

       --kms-location=KMS_LOCATION
          The Google Cloud location for the key.

          To set the kms-location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-key on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-location on the command line.

       --kms-project=KMS_PROJECT
          The Google Cloud project for the key.

          To set the kms-project attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-key on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-project on the command line;
          ▸ set the property core/project.
