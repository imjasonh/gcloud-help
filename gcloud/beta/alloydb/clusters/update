POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CLUSTER
        AlloyDB cluster ID

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Regional location (e.g. asia-east1, us-east1). See the full list of
        regions at https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/instance-locations.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     Automated backup policy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-automated-backup
          Clears the automated backup policy on the cluster. The default
          automated backup policy will be used.

       --disable-automated-backup
          Disables automated backups on the cluster.

       Enable automated backup policy.

         --automated-backup-days-of-week=[DAYS_OF_WEEK,...]
            Comma-separated list of days of the week to perform a backup. At
            least one day of the week must be provided. (e.g.,
            --automated-backup-days-of-week=MONDAY,WEDNESDAY,SUNDAY).
            DAYS_OF_WEEK must be one of: MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY,
            FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --automated-backup-start-times=[START_TIMES,...]
            Comma-separated list of times during the day to start a backup. At
            least one start time must be provided. The start times are assumed
            to be in UTC and required to be an exact hour in the format HH:00.
            (e.g., --automated-backup-start-times=01:00,13:00)

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --automated-backup-window=TIMEOUT_PERIOD
            The length of the time window beginning at start time during which
            a backup can be taken. If a backup does not succeed within this
            time window, it will be canceled and considered failed. The backup
            window must be at least 5 minutes long. There is no upper bound on
            the window. If not set, it will default to 1 hour.

         Retention policy. If no retention policy is provided, all automated
         backups will be retained.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --automated-backup-retention-count=RETENTION_COUNT
              Number of most recent successful backups retained.

           --automated-backup-retention-period=RETENTION_PERIOD
              Retention period of the backup relative to creation time. See $
              gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.
