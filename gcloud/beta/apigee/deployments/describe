    gcloud beta apigee deployments describe retrieves the status of a specific
    API proxy's deployment to a specific environment.

EXAMPLES
    To get the status of a deployment in the active Cloud Platform project,
    which deploys my-proxy into the prod environment, run:

        $ gcloud beta apigee deployments describe --api=my-proxy \
          --environment=prod

    To get the status of that deployment as a JSON object, run:

        $ gcloud beta apigee deployments describe --api=my-proxy \
          --environment=prod --format=json

    To get the status of a deployment in an organization called my-org, which
    deploys version 3 of the proxy my-proxy into the test environment, run:

        $ gcloud beta apigee deployments describe 3 --organization=my-org \
          --environment=test --api=my-proxy

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Revision resource - API proxy revision and environment of the deployment
     to be described.

     To get a list of deployed proxies and their environments, run:

         $ gcloud beta apigee deployments list

     REVISION can either be a positive revision number, or the special value
     auto, which will choose whichever revision of API is currently deployed in
     ENVIRONMENT, or return an error if more than one revision is deployed.

    If REVISION is unspecified, the default is auto.

        The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.
