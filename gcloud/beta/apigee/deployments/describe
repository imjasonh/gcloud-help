DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Describe an Apigee API proxy deployment.

    gcloud beta apigee deployments describe retrieves the status of a specific
    API proxy's deployment to a specific environment.

EXAMPLES
    To get the status of a deployment in the active Cloud Platform project,
    which deploys my-proxy into the prod environment, run:

        $ gcloud beta apigee deployments describe --api=my-proxy \
          --environment=prod

    To get the status of that deployment as a JSON object, run:

        $ gcloud beta apigee deployments describe --api=my-proxy \
          --environment=prod --format=json

    To get the status of a deployment in an organization called my-org, which
    deploys version 3 of the proxy my-proxy into the test environment, run:

        $ gcloud beta apigee deployments describe 3 --organization=my-org \
          --environment=test --api=my-proxy

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Revision resource - API proxy revision and environment of the deployment
     to be described.

     To get a list of deployed proxies and their environments, run:

         $ gcloud beta apigee deployments list

     REVISION can either be a positive revision number, or the special value
     auto, which will choose whichever revision of API is currently deployed in
     ENVIRONMENT, or return an error if more than one revision is deployed.

    If REVISION is unspecified, the default is auto.

        The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.

         [REVISION]
            ID of the revision or fully qualified identifier for the revision.

            To set the revision attribute:
            ▸ provide the argument REVISION on the command line;
            ▸ leave the argument unspecified for it to be chosen
              automatically.

         --api=API
            Deployed API proxy.

            To set the api attribute:

              automatically with a fully specified name;
            ▸ provide the argument --api on the command line.

         --environment=ENVIRONMENT
            Environment in which the proxy was deployed.

            To set the environment attribute:

              specified name;

         --organization=ORGANIZATION
            Apigee Organization of the proxy and environment. If unspecified,
            the Cloud Platform project's associated organization will be used.

            To set the organization attribute:
            ▸ provide the argument REVISION on the command line with a fully
              specified name;
