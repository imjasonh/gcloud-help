        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--disabled]
        [--exclusion=[description=DESCRIPTION],
          [disabled=DISABLED],[filter=FILTER],[name=NAME]] [--include-children]
        [--log-filter=LOG_FILTER] [--use-partitioned-tables]
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a log sink used to route log entries to a destination. The
    sink routes all log entries that match its --log-filter flag.

    An empty filter matches all logs.

    Detailed information about filters can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language

    The sink's destination can be a Cloud Logging log bucket, a Cloud Storage
    bucket, a BigQuery dataset, a Cloud Pub/Sub topic, or a Google Cloud
    project.

    The destination must already exist.

    If creating a log sink to route logs to a destination outside of Cloud
    Logging or to a Cloud Logging log bucket in another project, the log sink's
    service account must be granted permission to write to the destination.

    For more information about destination permissions, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#dest-auth

    Matching log entries are routed to the destination after the sink is
    created.

EXAMPLES
    To route all Google Compute Engine logs to BigQuery, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging sinks create my-bq-sink \
            bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/\
        my_dataset --log-filter='resource.type="gce_instance"'

    To route "syslog" from App Engine Flexible to a Cloud Storage bucket, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging sinks create my-gcs-sink \
            storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket \
            --log-filter='logName="projects/my-project/appengine.googleapis.\
        com%2Fsyslog"'

    To route Google App Engine logs with ERROR severity, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging sinks create my-error-logs \
            bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/\
        my_dataset --log-filter='resource.type="gae_app" AND severity=ERROR'

    To route all logs to a log bucket in a different project, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging sinks create my-sink \
            logging.googleapis.com/projects/my-central-project/locations/\
        global/buckets/my-central-bucket

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name for the sink.

     DESTINATION
        The destination for the sink.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the sink.

     --disabled
        Sink will be disabled. Disabled sinks do not export logs.

     --exclusion=[description=DESCRIPTION],[disabled=DISABLED],[filter=FILTER],[name=NAME]
        Specify an exclusion filter for a log entry that is not to be exported.
        This flag can be repeated.

        The name and filter attributes are required. The following keys are
        accepted:

         name
            An identifier, such as load-balancer-exclusion. Identifiers are
            limited to 100 characters and can include only letters, digits,
            underscores, hyphens, and periods.

         description
            A description of this exclusion.

         filter
            An advanced log filter that matches the log entries to be excluded.

         disabled
            If this exclusion should be disabled and not exclude the log
            entries.

     --include-children
        Whether to export logs from all child projects and folders. Only
        applies to sinks for organizations and folders.

     --log-filter=LOG_FILTER
        A filter expression for the sink. If present, the filter specifies
        which log entries to export.

     Settings for sink exporting data to BigQuery.

       --use-partitioned-tables
          If specified, use BigQuery's partitioned tables. By default, Logging
          creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g.
          'syslog_20170523'. Partitioned tables remove the suffix and special
          query syntax
          (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables)
          must be used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Billing account of the sink to create.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the sink to create.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the sink to create.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the sink to create.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud logging sinks create
