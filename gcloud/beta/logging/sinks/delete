NAME
    gcloud beta logging sinks delete - delete a sink

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta logging sinks delete SINK_NAME
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Delete a sink and halt the export of log entries associated with
    that sink. Deleting a sink does not affect log entries already exported
    through the deleted sink, and will not affect other sinks that are
    exporting the same log(s).

EXAMPLES
    To delete a sync 'my-bq-sync':

        $ gcloud beta logging sinks delete my-bq-sink

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name of the sink to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Billing account of the sink to delete.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the sink to delete.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the sink to delete.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the sink to delete.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
