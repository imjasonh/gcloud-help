DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Change the [DESTINATION] or --log-filter associated with a sink. The
    new destination must already exist and Cloud Logging must have permission
    to write to it.

    Log entries are exported to the new destination immediately.

EXAMPLES
    To only update a sink filter, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging sinks update my-sink \
            --log-filter='severity>=ERROR'

    Detailed information about filters can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name of the sink to update.

     [DESTINATION]
        A new destination for the sink. If omitted, the sink's existing
        destination is unchanged.

FLAGS
     --add-exclusion=[description=DESCRIPTION],[disabled=DISABLED],[filter=FILTER],[name=NAME]
        Add an exclusion filter for log entries that are not to be routed to
        the sink' destination. This flag can be repeated.

        The name and filter attributes are required. The following keys are
        accepted:

         name
            Required. An identifier, such as load-balancer-exclusion.
            Identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only
            letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and periods.

         description
            Optional. A description of this exclusion.

         filter
            Required. Entries that match this advanced log filter will be
            excluded. Filter cannot be empty.

         disabled
            Optional. By default, an exclusion is not disabled. To disable an
            exclusion, include this key and specify any value.

     --clear-exclusions
        Remove all logging exclusions from the sink.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the sink.

     --disabled
        Disable the sink. Disabled sinks do not route logs to the sink
        destination. Specify --no-disabled to enable a disabled sink. If this
        flag is not specified, the value will not be updated.

     --log-filter=LOG_FILTER
        A new filter expression for the sink. If omitted, the sink's existing
        filter (if any) is unchanged.

     --remove-exclusions=[EXCLUSION ID,...]
        Specify the name of the Logging exclusion(s) to delete.

     --update-exclusion=[description=DESCRIPTION],[disabled=DISABLED],[filter=FILTER],[name=NAME]
        Update an exclusion filter for a log entry that is not to be exported.
        This flag can be repeated.

        The name attribute is required. The following keys are accepted:

         name
            Required. An identifier, such as load-balancer-exclusion.
            Identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only
            letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and periods.

         description
            Optional. A description of this exclusion.

         filter
            Optional. Entries that match this advanced log filter will be
            excluded. Filter cannot be empty.

         disabled
            Optional. To disable an exclusion, include this key and specify any
            value. To enable a disabled exclusion, include this key, but do not
            specify any value. Do not include this key unless you want to
            change its value.

     Settings for sink exporting data to BigQuery.

       --use-partitioned-tables
          If specified, use BigQuery's partitioned tables. By default, Logging
          creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g.
          'syslog_20170523'. Partitioned tables remove the suffix and special
          query syntax
          (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables)
          must be used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Billing account of the sink to update.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the sink to update.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the sink to update.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the sink to update.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.
