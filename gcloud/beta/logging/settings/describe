NAME
    gcloud beta logging settings describe - displays the settings for the Cloud
        Logging Logs Router

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta logging settings describe
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) If kmsKeyName is present in the output, then CMEK is enabled for
    your project, folder, organization or billing-account. You can also find
    the Logs Router service account using this command.

EXAMPLES
    To describe the Logs Router settings for a project, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging settings describe --project=[PROJECT_ID]

    To describe the Logs Router settings for an organization, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging settings describe \
            --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID]

        kmsKeyName:
        'projects/my-project/locations/my-location/keyRings/my-keyring/cryptoKeys/key'
        name: 'organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/settings'
        serviceAccountId:
        '[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID]@gcp-sa-logging.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Describe settings associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Describe settings associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Describe settings associated with this organization.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Describe settings associated with this project.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
