SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta logging buckets undelete BUCKET_ID --location=LOCATION
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

EXAMPLES
    To undelete bucket 'my-bucket' in location 'global', run:

        $ gcloud beta logging buckets undelete my-bucket --location=global

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BUCKET_ID
        ID of the bucket to undelete.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the bucket.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Undelete a bucket associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Undelete a bucket associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Undelete a bucket associated with this organization.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Undelete a bucket associated with this project.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
