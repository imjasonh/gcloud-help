NAME
    gcloud beta logging operations describe - display the information about a
        long running operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta logging operations describe OPERATION_ID --location=LOCATION
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Display the information about a long running operation which was
    scheduled before. For example, a copy_log_entries operation scheduled by
    command: "gcloud alpha logging copy BUCKET_ID DESTINATION
    --location=LOCATION" OPERATION_ID and LOCATION are required to locate such
    operation.

EXAMPLES
    To describe an operation, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging operations describe OPERATION_ID \
            --location=LOCATION

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION_ID
        The Id of the operation.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the operation.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Billing account of the operation to describe.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the operation to describe.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the operation to describe.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the operation to describe.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
