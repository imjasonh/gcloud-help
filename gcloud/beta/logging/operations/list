NAME
    gcloud beta logging operations list - list long running operations

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta logging operations list --location=LOCATION
        --operation-filter=OPERATION_FILTER
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Return a list of long running operation details in given LOCATION.
    The operations were scheduled by other gcloud commands. For example: a
    copy_log_entries operation scheduled by command: gcloud alpha logging
    operations copy BUCKET_ID DESTINATION --location=LOCATION. Note: while
    listing the operations, the request_type must be specified in filter.
    Example: --operation-filter=request_type=CopyLogEntries, Supported
    operation types are: CopyLogEntries, CreateBucket and UpdateBucket. Other
    supported filter expression are: operation_start_time,
    operation_finish_time and operation_state.

EXAMPLES
    To list CopyLogEntries operations, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging operations list --location=LOCATION \
          --operation-filter='request_type=CopyLogEntries'

    To list CopyLogEntries operations that started after a specified time, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging operations list --location=LOCATION \
          --operation-filter='request_type=CopyLogEntries AND
        operation_start_time>="2023-11-20T00:00:00Z"'

    To list CopyLogEntries operations that finished before a specified time,
    run:

        $ gcloud beta logging operations list --location=LOCATION \
          --operation-filter='request_type=CopyLogEntries AND
        operation_finish_time<="2023-11-20T00:00:00Z"'

    To list CopyLogEntries operations that have a specified state, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging operations list --location=LOCATION \
          --operation-filter='request_type=CopyLogEntries AND
        operation_state=STATE'

    To list CopyLogEntries operations that don't have a specified state, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging operations list --location=LOCATION \
          --operation-filter='request_type=CopyLogEntries AND
        operation_state!=STATE'

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the operations.

     --operation-filter=OPERATION_FILTER
        Filter expression that specifies the operations to return.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Billing account of the operations to list.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the operations to list.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the operations to list.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the operations to list.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud logging operations list

        $ gcloud alpha logging operations list
