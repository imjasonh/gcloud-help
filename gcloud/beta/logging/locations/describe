NAME
    gcloud beta logging locations describe - display information about a
        location

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta logging locations describe LOCATION_ID
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Displays information about a location.

EXAMPLES
    To describe a location in a project, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging locations describe my-location

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     LOCATION_ID
        Id of the location to describe.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Describe a location associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Describe a location associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Describe a location associated with this organization.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Describe a location associated with this project.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS

    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
