NAME
    gcloud beta container fleet scopes list-app-operator-bindings - list app
        operator principals corresponding to a fleet scope and their roles
        based on project-level IAM bindings, fleet scope-level IAM bindings,
        and fleet scope RBAC role bindings

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container fleet scopes list-app-operator-bindings SCOPE
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command lists bindings corresponding to a fleet scope. The
    bindings, which consist of an app operator principal and a role, grant
    permissions required for an app operator, including usage of fleet scopes,
    connect gateway, logging, and metrics. The overarching principal role
    (view/edit/admin, or custom) is determined by (1) the fleet scope RBAC role
    (view, edit, or admin), (2) the fleet scope-level IAM role
    (roles/gkehub.scopeViewer, roles/gkehub.scopeEditor, or
    roles/gkehub.scopeAdmin), (3) the project-level IAM role
    (roles/gkehub.scopeViewerProjectLevel, or
    roles/gkehub.scopeEditorProjectLevel), and (4) the conditional log view
    access role for the scope bucket.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The scope specified does not exist.
      ▪ The user does not have access to the specified scope.

EXAMPLES
    The following command lists app operator principals corresponding to SCOPE
    under PROJECT_ID, their roles, and role details (fleet scope RBAC role,
    fleet scope-level IAM role, project-level IAM role, and log view access):

        $ gcloud beta container fleet scopes list-app-operator-bindings \
            --scope=SCOPE --project=PROJECT_ID

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Scope resource - The group of arguments defining the Fleet Scope. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument SCOPE on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     To set the location attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument SCOPE on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ global is the only supported location.

     This must be specified.

       SCOPE
          ID of the scope or fully qualified identifier for the scope.

          To set the scope attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument SCOPE on the command line.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet scopes list-app-operator-bindings
