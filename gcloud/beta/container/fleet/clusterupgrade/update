        clusterupgrade feature for a fleet within a given project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container fleet clusterupgrade update
        [--default-upgrade-soaking=DEFAULT_UPGRADE_SOAKING]
        [--remove-upgrade-soaking-overrides
          | --add-upgrade-soaking-override=ADD_UPGRADE_SOAKING_OVERRIDE

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update the clusterupgrade feature for a fleet within a given
    project.

EXAMPLES
    To update the clusterupgrade feature for the current fleet, run:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet clusterupgrade update \
            --default-upgrade-soaking=DEFAULT_UPGRADE_SOAKING

FLAGS
     --default-upgrade-soaking=DEFAULT_UPGRADE_SOAKING
        Note: This flag only applies to Rollout Sequencing v1, not Rollout
        Sequencing v2 (which uses custom stages). If using Rollout Sequencing
        v1 and this flag is not provided, a default value of 7 days will be
        used.

        Configures the default soaking duration for each upgrade propagating
        through the current fleet to become "COMPLETE". Soaking begins after
        all clusters in the fleet are on the target version, or after 30 days
        if all cluster upgrades are not complete. Once an upgrade state becomes
        "COMPLETE", it will automatically be propagated to the downstream
        fleet. Max is 30 days.

        To configure Rollout Sequencing for a fleet, this attribute must be
        set. To do this while specifying a default soaking duration of 7 days,
        run:

            $ gcloud beta container fleet clusterupgrade update \
                --default-upgrade-soaking=7d

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --remove-upgrade-soaking-overrides
          Removes soaking time overrides for all upgrades propagating through
          the current fleet. Consequently, all upgrades will follow the soak
          time configured by --default-upgrade-soaking until new overrides are
          configured with --add_upgrade_soaking_override and
          --upgrade_selector.

          To remove all configured soaking time overrides, run:

              $ gcloud beta container fleet clusterupgrade update \
                  --remove-upgrade-soaking-overrides

       Upgrade soaking override.

       Defines a specific soaking time override for a particular upgrade
       propagating through the current fleet that supercedes the default
       soaking duration configured by --default-upgrade-soaking.

       To set an upgrade soaking override of 12 hours for the upgrade with
       name, k8s_control_plane, and version, 1.23.1-gke.1000, run:

           $ gcloud beta container fleet clusterupgrade update               \
               --add-upgrade-soaking-override=12h               \
               --upgrade-selector=name="k8s_control_plane",\
           version="1.23.1-gke.1000"

         --add-upgrade-soaking-override=ADD_UPGRADE_SOAKING_OVERRIDE
            Overrides the soaking time for a particular upgrade name and
            version propagating through the current fleet. Set soaking to 0
            days to bypass soaking and fast-forward the upgrade to the
            downstream fleet.

            See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --upgrade-selector=[name=NAME],[version=VERSION]
            Name and version of the upgrade to be overridden where version is a
            full GKE version. Currently, name can be either k8s_control_plane
            or k8s_node.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --reset-upstream-fleet
          Clears the relationship between the current fleet and its upstream
          fleet in the rollout sequence.

          To remove the link between the current fleet and its upstream fleet,
          run:

              $ gcloud beta container fleet clusterupgrade update \
                  --reset-upstream-fleet

       --upstream-fleet=UPSTREAM_FLEET
          The upstream fleet. GKE will finish upgrades on the upstream fleet
          before applying the same upgrades to the current fleet.

          To configure the upstream fleet, run:

              $ gcloud beta container fleet clusterupgrade update             \
                  --upstream-fleet={upstream_fleet}
