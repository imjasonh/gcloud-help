NAME
    gcloud beta container fleet clusterupgrade describe - describe the
        clusterupgrade feature for a fleet within a given project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container fleet clusterupgrade describe
        [--show-linked-cluster-upgrade] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Describe the Fleet clusterupgrade feature used for configuring
    fleet-based rollout sequencing.

EXAMPLES
    To view the cluster upgrade feature information for the current fleet, run:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet clusterupgrade describe

FLAGS
     --show-linked-cluster-upgrade
        Shows the cluster upgrade feature information for the current fleet as
        well as information for all other fleets linked in the same rollout
        sequence (provided that the caller has permission to view the upstream
        and downstream fleets). This displays cluster upgrade information for
        fleets in the current fleet's rollout sequence in order of furthest
        upstream to downstream.

        To view the cluster upgrade feature information for the rollout
        sequence containing the current fleet, run:

            $ gcloud beta container fleet clusterupgrade describe \
                --show-linked-cluster-upgrade
