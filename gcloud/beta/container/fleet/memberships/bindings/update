        Binding in a Membership

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container fleet memberships bindings update
        (BINDING : --location=LOCATION --membership=MEMBERSHIP)
        (--fleet=FLEET | --scope=SCOPE) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The Membership specified does not exist.
      ▪ The Binding does not exist in the Membership.
      ▪ The caller does not have permission to access the Membership/Binding.
      ▪ The Scope specified does not exist.
      ▪ The caller did not specify the location (--location) if referring to
        location other than global.

EXAMPLES

    the active project:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet memberships bindings update \
            BINDING_NAME --membership=MEMBERSHIP_NAME

    To update a Binding BINDING_NAME associated with regional membership
    MEMBERSHIP_NAME, provide the location LOCATION_NAME for the Membership
    where the Binding belongs along with membership name and associated Scope
    SCOPE_NAME.

        $ gcloud beta container fleet memberships bindings update \
            BINDING_NAME --membership=MEMBERSHIP_NAME --scope=SCOPE_NAME \
            --location=LOCATION_NAME
