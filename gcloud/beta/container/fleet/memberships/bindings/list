NAME
    gcloud beta container fleet memberships bindings list - list Bindings in a
        Membership

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container fleet memberships bindings list
        --membership=MEMBERSHIP [--location=LOCATION; default="global"]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The Membership specified does not exist.
      ▪ The user does not have access to the Membership specified.
      ▪ The caller did not specify the location (--location) if referring to
        location other than global.

EXAMPLES
    The following command lists Bindings in global Membership MEMBERSHIP_NAME:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet memberships bindings list \
            --membership=MEMBERSHIP_NAME

    To list all the bindings associated with regional membership
    MEMBERSHIP_NAME, provide the location LOCATION_NAME for the Membership
    where the Binding belongs along with membership name.

        $ gcloud beta container fleet memberships bindings list \
            BINDING_NAME --membership=MEMBERSHIP_NAME \
            --location=LOCATION_NAME

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --membership=MEMBERSHIP
        Name of the Membership to list Bindings from.

FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION; default="global"
        Name of the Membership location to list Bindings from.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha container fleet memberships bindings list
