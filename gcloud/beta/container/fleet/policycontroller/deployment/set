NAME
    gcloud beta container fleet policycontroller deployment set - sets
        configuration of the Policy Controller components

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container fleet policycontroller deployment set DEPLOYMENT
        PROPERTY VALUE [--effect=EFFECT]
        [--all-memberships
          | [--memberships=[MEMBERSHIPS,...] : --location=LOCATION]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Customizes on-cluster components of Policy Controller. Supported
    properties may be set with this command, or removed with 'remove'. These
    components are managed as individual kubernetes deployments (e.g.
    'admission') in the gatekeeper-system namespace.

    When setting cpu or memory limits and requests, Kubernetes-standard
    resource units are used.

    All properties set using this command will overwrite previous properties,
    with the exception of tolerations which can only be added, and any number
    may be added. To edit a toleration, use 'remove' to first delete it, and
    then 'set' the desired toleration.

EXAMPLES
    To set the replica count for a component:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet policycontroller deployment set \
            admission replica-count 3

    To set the replica count for a component across all fleet memberships:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet policycontroller deployment set \
            admission replica-count 3 --all-memberships

    To set a toleration with key 'my-key' on a component (which is an 'Exists'
    operator):

        $ gcloud beta container fleet policycontroller deployment set \
            admission toleration my-key

    To set a toleration with key 'my-key' and 'my-value' on a component (which
    is an 'Equal' operator):

        $ gcloud beta container fleet policycontroller deployment set \
            admission toleration my-key=my-value

    To set a toleration with key 'my-key' and 'my-value' on a component, along
    with the effect 'NoSchedule' (which is an 'Equal' operator):

        $ gcloud beta container fleet policycontroller deployment set \
            admission toleration my-key=my-value --effect=NoSchedule

    To set a memory limit:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet policycontroller deployment set \
            audit memory-limit 4Gi

    To set a memory request:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet policycontroller deployment set \
            mutation memory-request 2Gi

    To set a cpu limit:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet policycontroller deployment set \
            admission cpu-limit 500m

    To set a cpu request:

        $ gcloud beta container fleet policycontroller deployment set \
            audit cpu-request 250m

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DEPLOYMENT
        The PolicyController deployment component (e.g. "admission", "audit" or
        "mutation") upon which to set configuration.

     PROPERTY
        Property to be set.

     VALUE
        The value to set the property to. Valid input varies based on the
        property being set.

FLAGS
     --effect=EFFECT
        Applies only to "toleration" property. EFFECT must be one of:
        NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule, NoExecute.

     Membership flags.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --all-memberships
          If supplied, apply to all Policy Controllers memberships in the
          fleet.

       Membership resource - The group of arguments defining one or more
       memberships. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
       attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
       arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

       To set the project attribute:
        ▸ provide the argument --memberships on the command line with a fully
          specified name;
        ▸ provide the argument --project on the command line;
        ▸ set the property core/project.

         --memberships=[MEMBERSHIPS,...]
            IDs of the memberships or fully qualified identifiers for the
            memberships.

            To set the memberships attribute:
            ▫ provide the argument --memberships on the command line.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --location=LOCATION
            Location for the memberships.

            To set the location attribute:
            ▫ provide the argument --memberships on the command line with a
              fully specified name;
            ▫ provide the argument --location on the command line;
            ▫ set the property gkehub/location.
