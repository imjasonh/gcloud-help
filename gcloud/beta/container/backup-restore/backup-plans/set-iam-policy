EXAMPLES
    To set the IAM policy for a backup plan my-backup-plan in project
    my-project in location us-central1 with the policy defined in the JSON file
    policy.json, run:

        $ gcloud beta container backup-restore backup-plans set-iam-policy \

            --location=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup plan resource - Name of the backup plan for which to set IAM
     policy. The name may be provided either as a relative name, e.g.
     projects/<project>/locations/<location>/backupPlans/<backupPlan> or as a
     single ID name (with the parent resources provided via options or through
     properties), e.g. BACKUP_PLAN --project=<project> --location=<location>
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument backup_plan on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP_PLAN
          ID of the backup plan or fully qualified identifier for the backup
          plan.

          To set the backup_plan attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup_plan on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup_plan on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property gkebackup/location.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
