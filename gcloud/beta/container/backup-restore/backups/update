        [--delete-lock-days=DELETE_LOCK_DAYS] [--description=DESCRIPTION]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update a Backup for GKE backup.

EXAMPLES
    To update a backup my-backup in project my-project in location us-central1
    under backup plan my-backup-plan to add new description, run:

        $ gcloud beta container backup-restore backups update 'my-backup' \
            --backup-plan=my-backup-plan --project=my-project \
            --location=us-central1 --description="New description"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup resource - Name of the backup to update. The name may be provided
     either as a relative name, e.g.
     projects/<project>/locations/<location>/backupPlans/<backupPlan>/backups/<backup>
     or as a single ID name (with the parent resources provided via options or
     through properties), e.g. BACKUP --project=<project> --location=<location>
     --backup-plan=<backupPlan>. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument backup on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP
          ID of the backup or fully qualified identifier for the backup. To set
          the backup attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --backup-plan=BACKUP_PLAN
          Backup Plan name. To set the backup-plan attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --backup-plan on the command line;
          ▸ set the property gkebackup/backup_plan.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property gkebackup/location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --delete-lock-days=DELETE_LOCK_DAYS
        Delete lock days specifies the number of days from the createTime of
        this Backup before which deletion will be blocked. Must be >= the value
        in the backup plan. If not specified, inherited from the backup plan.
        Manual creation of a backup with this field unspecified causes the
        service to use the value of
        backupPlan.RetentionPolicy.backupDeleteBlockDays. Creation of a backup
        with this field set to a value SMALLER than
        backupPlan.RetentionPolicy.backupDeleteBlockDays results in an invalid
        response from the service. This field MUST be an int value between
        0-90(inclusive). This field may only be INCREASED in an update command,
        or an invalid response will be returned by the service.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Optional text description for the backup.

     --etag=ETAG
        The etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        prevent simultaneous updates or deletes of a resource from overwriting
        each other.

     --retain-days=RETAIN_DAYS
        Retain days specifies the desired number of days from the createTime of
        this backup after which it will be automatically deleted. If not
        specified or set to 0, it means the backup will NOT be automatically
        deleted. Manual creation of a backup with this field unspecified causes
        the service to use the value of
        backupPlan.retentionPolicy.backupRetainDays. Creation of a backup with
        this field set to a value SMALLER than deleteLockDays results in an
        invalid response from the service. This field may ONLY be increased in
        an Update command, or an invalid response will be returned by the
        service immediately. Default to 0.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud beta container backup-restore backups update --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud beta container backup-restore backups update \
                --clear-labels --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.
