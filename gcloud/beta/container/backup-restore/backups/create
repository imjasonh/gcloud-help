            --project=my-project --location=us-central1 \
            --backup-plan=my-backup-plan

    To create a backup my-backup in project my-project in location us-central1
    under backup plan my-backup-plan and not wait for the resulting operation
    to finish, run:

        $ gcloud beta container backup-restore backups create my-backup \
            --project=my-project --location=us-central1 \
            --backup-plan=my-backup-plan --async

    To create a backup my-backup in project my-project in location us-central1
    under backup plan my-backup-plan and wait for the Backup        to complete, run:

        $ gcloud beta container backup-restore backups create my-backup \
            --project=my-project --location=us-central1 \
            --backup-plan=my-backup-plan --wait-for-completion

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup resource - Name of the backup to create. Once the backup is
     created, this name can't be changed. This must be 63 or fewer characters
     long and must be unique within the project, location, and backup plan. The
     name may be provided either as a relative name, e.g.
     projects/<project>/locations/<location>/backupPlans/<backupPlan>/backups/<backup>
     or as a single ID name (with the parent resources provided via options or
     through properties), e.g. BACKUP --project=<project> --location=<location>
     --backup_plan=<backupPlan>. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument backup on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       BACKUP
          ID of the backup or fully qualified identifier for the backup.

          To set the name attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --backup-plan=BACKUP_PLAN
          Backup Plan name.

          To set the backup-plan attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --backup-plan on the command line;
          ▸ set the property gkebackup/backup_plan.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument backup on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property gkebackup/location.

FLAGS
     --delete-lock-days=DELETE_LOCK_DAYS
        Delete lock days specifies the number of days from the createTime of
        this Backup before which deletion will be blocked. Must be >= the value
        in the backup plan. If not specified, inherited from the backup plan.
        Manual creation of a backup with this field unspecified causes the
        service to use the value of
        backupPlan.RetentionPolicy.backupDeleteBlockDays. Creation of a backup
        with this field set to a value SMALLER than
        backupPlan.RetentionPolicy.backupDeleteBlockDays results in an invalid
        response from the service. This field MUST be an int value between
        0-90(inclusive). This field may only be INCREASED in an update command,
        or an invalid response will be returned by the service.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Optional text description for the backup being created.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --retain-days=RETAIN_DAYS
        Retain days specifies the desired number of days from the createTime of
        this backup after which it will be automatically deleted. If not
        specified or set to 0, it means the backup will NOT be automatically
        deleted. Manual creation of a backup with this field unspecified causes
        the service to use the value of
        backupPlan.retentionPolicy.backupRetainDays. Creation of a Backup with
        this field set to a value SMALLER than delete_lock_days results in an
        invalid response from the service. This field may ONLY be increased in
        an Update request, or an invalid response will be returned by the
        service immediately. Default to 0 if not provided.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --async
          Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
          complete.

       --wait-for-completion
          Wait for the created backup to complete.
