NAME
    gcloud beta container operations cancel - cancel a running operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container operations cancel OPERATION_ID
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Cancel a running operation.

    Cancel is a best-effort method for aborting a running operation. Operations
    that have already completed can not be cancelled. If the operation has
    passed the "point of no-return", cancel will have no effect.

    An example of "point of no-return" in the context of Upgrade operations
    would be if all the nodes have been upgraded but the operation hasn't been
    marked as complete.

EXAMPLES
    To cancel an operation, run:

        $ gcloud beta container operations cancel sample-operation-id

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION_ID
        The operation id to cancel.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
