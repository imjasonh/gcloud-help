NAME
    gcloud beta container clusters resize - resizes an existing cluster for
        running containers

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container clusters resize NAME
        (--num-nodes=NUM_NODES | --size=NUM_NODES) [--async]
        [--node-pool=NODE_POOL]
        [--location=LOCATION | --region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Resize an existing cluster to a provided size.

    If you have multiple node pools, you must specify which node pool to resize
    by using the --node-pool flag. You are not required to use the flag if you
    have a single node pool.

    When increasing the size of a container cluster, the new instances are
    created with the same configuration as the existing instances. Existing
    pods are not moved onto the new instances, but new pods (such as those
    created by resizing a replication controller) will be scheduled onto the
    new instances.

    When decreasing a cluster, the nodes are drained. As a result, the pods
    running on these nodes are gracefully terminated. If your pods are being
    managed by a workload controller, the controller will attempt to reschedule
    them onto the remaining instances. If your pods are not managed by a
    workload controller, they will not be restarted. Note that when resizing
    down, instances running pods and instances without pods are not
    differentiated. Resize will pick instances to remove at random.

    When you resize a node pool that spans multiple zones, the new size
    represents the number of nodes in the node pool per zone. For example, if
    you have a node pool of size 2 spanning two zones, the total node count is
    4. If you resize the node pool with --num-nodes=4, the total node count
    becomes 8.

EXAMPLES
    To resize the default node pool of an existing cluster, run:

        $ gcloud beta container clusters resize sample-cluster --num-nodes=2

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of this cluster.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --num-nodes=NUM_NODES
          Target number of nodes in the cluster.

       --size=NUM_NODES
          (DEPRECATED) Target number of nodes in the cluster.

          The --size flag is now deprecated. Please use --num-nodes instead.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --node-pool=NODE_POOL
        The node pool to resize.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --location=LOCATION
          Compute zone or region (e.g. us-central1-a or us-central1) for the
          cluster. Overrides the default compute/region or compute/zone value
          for this command invocation. Prefer using this flag over the --region
          or --zone flags.

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for a regional cluster. Overrides
          the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for a zonal cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container clusters resize

        $ gcloud alpha container clusters resize
