NAME
    gcloud beta container clusters upgrade - upgrade the Kubernetes version of
        an existing container cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container clusters upgrade NAME [--async]
        [--cluster-version=CLUSTER_VERSION] [--image-type=IMAGE_TYPE]
        [--master] [--node-pool=NODE_POOL]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Upgrades the Kubernetes version of an existing container cluster.

    This command upgrades the Kubernetes version of the node pools or master of
    a cluster. Note that the Kubernetes version of the cluster's master is also
    periodically upgraded automatically as new releases are available.

    If desired cluster version is omitted, node pool upgrades default to the
    current master version and master upgrades default to the default cluster
    version, which can be found in the server config.

    During node pool upgrades, nodes will be deleted and recreated. While
    persistent Kubernetes resources, such as Pods backed by replication
    controllers, will be rescheduled onto new nodes, a small cluster may
    experience a few minutes where there are insufficient nodes available to
    run all of the scheduled Kubernetes resources.

    Please ensure that any data you wish to keep is stored on a persistent disk
    before upgrading the cluster. Ephemeral Kubernetes resources--in
    particular, Pods without replication controllers--will be lost, while
    persistent Kubernetes resources will get rescheduled.

EXAMPLES
    Upgrade the node pool pool-1 of sample-cluster to the Kubernetes version of
    the cluster's master.

        $ gcloud beta container clusters upgrade sample-cluster \
            --node-pool=pool-1

    Upgrade the node pool pool-1 of sample-cluster to Kubernetes version
    1.14.7-gke.14:

        $ gcloud beta container clusters upgrade sample-cluster \
            --node-pool=pool-1 --cluster-version="1.14.7-gke.14"

    Upgrade the master of sample-cluster to the default cluster version:

        $ gcloud beta container clusters upgrade sample-cluster --master

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the cluster to upgrade.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --cluster-version=CLUSTER_VERSION
        The GKE release version to which to upgrade the cluster's node pools or
        master.

        If desired cluster version is omitted, node pool upgrades default to
        the current master version and master upgrades default to the default
        cluster version, which can be found in the server config.

        You can find the list of allowed versions for upgrades by running:

            $ gcloud container get-server-config

     --image-type=IMAGE_TYPE
        The image type to use for the cluster/node pool. Defaults to
        server-specified.

        Image Type specifies the base OS that the nodes in the cluster/node
        pool will run on. If an image type is specified, that will be assigned
        to the cluster/node pool and all future upgrades will use the specified
        image type. If it is not specified the server will pick the default
        image type.

        The default image type and the list of valid image types are available
        using the following command.

            $ gcloud container get-server-config

     --master
        Upgrade the cluster's master. Node pools cannot be upgraded at the same
        time as the master.

     --node-pool=NODE_POOL
        The node pool to upgrade.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container clusters upgrade

        $ gcloud alpha container clusters upgrade
