    gcloud beta container binauthz attestors add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM
        policy binding to a Binary Authorization attestor

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container binauthz attestors add-iam-policy-binding ATTESTOR
        --member=PRINCIPAL --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Add an IAM policy binding to the IAM policy of a Binary
    Authorization attestor. One binding consists of a member, a role, and an
    optional condition.

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of
    roles/binaryauthorization.attestorsEditor for the user test-user@gmail.com
    on attestor my_attestor, run:

        $ gcloud beta container binauthz attestors add-iam-policy-binding \
            my_attestor --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/binaryauthorization.attestorsEditor'

    To add an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018 for
    the role of roles/binaryauthorization.attestorsEditor and the user
    test-user@gmail.com on attestor my_attestor, run:

        $ gcloud beta container binauthz attestors add-iam-policy-binding \
            my_attestor --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/binaryauthorization.attestorsEditor' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Attestor resource - The Binary Authorization attestor for which to add IAM
     policy binding to. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument attestor on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       ATTESTOR
          ID of the attestor or fully qualified identifier for the attestor. To
          set the attestor attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument attestor on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Role name to assign to the principal. The role name is the complete
        path of a predefined role, such as roles/logging.viewer, or the role ID
        for a custom role, such as
        organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/logging.viewer.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          A condition to include in the binding. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a basic role. Basic roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer. For more on conditions, refer to the
          conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.
