    gcloud beta container hub memberships bindings describe - show
        Membership-Binding info

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container hub memberships bindings describe
        (BINDING : --location=LOCATION --membership=MEMBERSHIP)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The Membership specified does not exist.
      ▪ The Membership Binding specified does not exist in the project.
      ▪ The caller does not have permission to access the Membership Binding.
      ▪ The caller did not specify the location (--location) if referring to
        location other than global.

EXAMPLES
    To print metadata for the membership Binding BINDING_NAME in a global
    membership MEMBERSHIP_NAME, run:

        $ gcloud beta container hub memberships bindings describe \
            BINDING_NAME --membership=MEMBERSHIP_NAME

    To print metadata for the Binding BINDING_NAME associated with regional
    membership MEMBERSHIP_NAME, provide the location LOCATION_NAME for the
    Membership where the Binding belongs along with membership name.

        $ gcloud beta container hub memberships bindings describe \
            BINDING_NAME --membership=MEMBERSHIP_NAME \
            --location=LOCATION_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Binding resource - The group of arguments defining a Membership Binding.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location for the binding. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument BINDING on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
