NAME
    gcloud beta deployment-manager - manage deployments of cloud resources

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta deployment-manager GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) The gcloud beta deployment-manager command group lets you manage the
    deployment of Google Cloud Platform resources using Google Cloud Deployment
    Manager.

    Google Cloud Deployment Manager allows you to specify all the resources
    needed for your application in a declarative format using YAML. You can
    also use Python or Jinja2 templates to parameterize the configuration and
    allow reuse of common deployment paradigms such as a load balanced,
    auto-scaled instance group.
