NAME
    gcloud beta ai endpoints - manage Vertex AI endpoints

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta ai endpoints COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) An endpoint contains one or more deployed models, all of which must
    have the same interface but may come from different models. An endpoint is
    to obtain online prediction and explanation from one of its deployed
    models.

    When you communicate with Vertex AI services, you identify a specific
    endpoint that is deployed in the cloud using a combination of the current
    project, the region, and the endpoint.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
