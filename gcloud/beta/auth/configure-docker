NAME
    gcloud beta auth configure-docker - register gcloud as a Docker credential
        helper

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta auth configure-docker [REGISTRIES] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta auth configure-docker adds the Docker credHelper entry
    to Docker's configuration file, or creates the file if it doesn't exist.
    This will register gcloud as the credential helper for all Google-supported
    Docker registries. If the Docker configuration already contains a
    credHelper entry, it will be overwritten.

    Note: docker and gcloud need to be on the same system PATH to work
    correctly.

    Note: This command will not work for docker installed via Snap, as the
    docker snap package does not currently provide an interface for credential
    helpers.

    For more details on Docker registries, see
    https://docs.docker.com/registry/.

    helper, see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/docker-credential-gcr.
