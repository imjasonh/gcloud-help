NAME
    gcloud beta auth login - authorize gcloud to access the Cloud Platform with
        Google user credentials

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta auth login [ACCOUNT] [--no-activate] [--brief] [--no-browser]
        [--cred-file=CRED_FILE] [--enable-gdrive-access] [--force]
        [--no-launch-browser] [--update-adc] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Obtains access credentials for your user account via a web-based
    authorization flow. When this command completes successfully, it sets the
    active account in the current configuration to the account specified. If no
    configuration exists, it creates a configuration named default.

    If valid credentials for an account are already available from a prior
    authorization, the account is set to active without rerunning the flow.

    Use gcloud auth list to view credentialed accounts.

    If you'd rather authorize without a web browser but still interact with the
    command line, use the --no-browser flag. To authorize without a web browser
    and non-interactively, create a service account with the appropriate scopes
    using the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com) and use
    gcloud auth activate-service-account with the corresponding JSON key file.

    In addition to Google user credentials, authorization using workload
    identity federation or service account keys is also supported.

    For authorization with external accounts (workload identity pools) or
    service accounts, the --cred-file flag must be specified with the path to
    the workload identity credential configuration file or service account key
    file (JSON). Login with workload identity federation is also supported in
    gsutil and this command is the recommended way of using external accounts.
    For more information on workload identity federation, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation.

    For more information on authorization and credential types, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing.

EXAMPLES
    To obtain access credentials for your user account, run:

        $ gcloud beta auth login

    To obtain access credentials using workload identity federation, run:

        $ gcloud beta auth login \
            --cred-file=/path/to/workload/configuration/file

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [ACCOUNT]
        User account used for authorization.

FLAGS
     --activate
        Set the new account to active. Enabled by default, use --no-activate to
        disable.

     --brief
        Minimal user output.

     --no-browser
        Use this flag to authenticate the gcloud CLI on a machine without a web
        browser.

        Run gcloud auth login --no-browser and follow these steps:

        1. Copy the long command that begins with "gcloud auth login
        --remote-bootstrap=".

        2. Paste and run this command on the command line of a different,
        trusted machine that has local installations of both a web browser and
        the gcloud CLI tool version 372.0 or later.

        3. Copy the long URL output from the machine with the web browser.

        4. Paste the long URL back to the first machine under the prompt,
        "Enter the output of the above command", and press Enter to complete
        the authorization.

     --cred-file=CRED_FILE
        Path to the external account configuration file (workload identity
        pool, generated by the Cloud Console or gcloud iam
        workload-identity-pools create-cred-config) or service account
        credential key file (JSON).

     --enable-gdrive-access
        Enable Google Drive access.

     --force
        Re-run the web authorization flow even if the given account has valid
        credentials.

     --launch-browser
        (DEPRECATED) Launch a browser for authorization. If not enabled or if
        it is not possible to launch a browser, prints a URL to standard output
        to be copied.

        The --[no-]launch-browser flags are deprecated and will be removed on
        June 7th 2022 (Release 389.0.0). Use --no-browser to replace
        --no-launch-browser. Enabled by default, use --no-launch-browser to
        disable.

     --update-adc
        Write the obtained credentials to the well-known location for
        Application Default Credentials (ADC). Run $ gcloud auth
        application-default --help to learn more about ADC. Any credentials
        previously generated by gcloud auth application-default login will be
        overwritten.

    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
