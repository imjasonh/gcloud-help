EXAMPLES
    To update the trigger my-trigger by setting its destination Cloud Run
    service to my-service, run:

        $ gcloud beta eventarc triggers update my-trigger \
             --destination-run-service=my-service

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Trigger resource - The trigger to update. The arguments in this group can
     be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument trigger on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       TRIGGER
          ID of the trigger or fully qualified identifier for the trigger.

          To set the trigger attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument trigger on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location for the Eventarc trigger, which should be either global
          or one of the supported regions. Alternatively, set the
          [eventarc/location] property.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument trigger on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property eventarc/location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --matching-criteria=[ATTRIBUTE=VALUE,...]
        The criteria by which events are filtered for the trigger, specified as
        a comma-separated list of CloudEvents attribute names and values. This
        flag can also be repeated to add more criteria to the list. Only events
        that match with this criteria will be sent to the destination. The
        criteria must include the type attribute, as well as any other
        attributes that are expected for the chosen type.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-service-account
          Clear the IAM service account associated with the trigger.

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          The IAM service account email associated with the trigger.

     Flags for updating the destination to which events should be sent.

       Flags for updating a Cloud Run fully-managed resource destination.

         --destination-run-region=DESTINATION_RUN_REGION
            Region in which the destination Cloud Run service can be found. If
            not specified, it is assumed that the service is in the same region
            as the trigger.

         --destination-run-service=DESTINATION_RUN_SERVICE
            Name of the Cloud Run fully-managed service that receives the
            events for the trigger. The service must be in the same project as
            the trigger.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --clear-destination-run-path
              Clear the relative path on the destination Cloud Run service to
              which the events for the trigger should be sent.

           --destination-run-path=DESTINATION_RUN_PATH
              Relative path on the destination Cloud Run service to which the
              events for the trigger should be sent. Examples: /route, route,
              route/subroute.
