DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) A pipeline is a transformation of a set of inputs to a set of
    outputs. Supports Docker-based commands.

EXAMPLES
    To run a pipeline described in the pipeline.json file, run:

        $ gcloud beta lifesciences pipelines run \
            --pipeline-file=pipeline.json

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --command-line=COMMAND_LINE
          Command line to run with /bin/sh in the specified Docker image.
          Cannot be used with --pipeline-file.

       --pipeline-file=PIPELINE_FILE
          A YAML or JSON file containing a Pipeline object. See
          https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs/reference/rest/v2beta/projects.locations.pipelines/run#pipeline

COMMONLY USED FLAGS
     --disk-size=DISK_SIZE
        The disk size(s) in GB, specified as a comma-separated list of pairs of
        disk name and size. For example: --disk-size "name:size,name2:size2".
        Overrides any values specified in the pipeline-file.

     --docker-image=DOCKER_IMAGE; default="google/cloud-sdk:slim"
        A Docker image to run. Requires --command-line to be specified and
        cannot be used with --pipeline-file.

     --env-vars=[NAME=VALUE,...]
        List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables.

     --inputs=[NAME=VALUE,...]
        Map of input PipelineParameter names to values. Used to pass literal
        parameters to the pipeline, and to specify input files in Google Cloud
        Storage that will have a localCopy made. Specified as a comma-separated
        list: --inputs file=gs://my-bucket/in.txt,name=hello

     --inputs-from-file=[NAME=FILE,...]
        Map of input PipelineParameter names to values. Used to pass literal
        parameters to the pipeline where values come from local files; this can
        be used to send large pipeline input parameters, such as code, data, or
        configuration values. Specified as a comma-separated list:
        --inputs-from-file script=myshellscript.sh,pyfile=mypython.py

     --logging=LOGGING
        The location in Google Cloud Storage to which the pipeline logs will be
        copied. Can be specified as a fully qualified directory path, in which
        case logs will be output with a unique identifier as the filename in
        that directory, or as a fully specified path, which must end in .log,
        in which case that path will be used. Stdout and stderr logs from the
        run are also generated and output as -stdout.log and -stderr.log.

     --outputs=[NAME=VALUE,...]
        Map of output PipelineParameter names to values. Used to specify output
        files in Google Cloud Storage that will be made from a localCopy.
        Specified as a comma-separated list: --outputs
        ref=gs://my-bucket/foo,ref2=gs://my-bucket/bar

     --preemptible
        Whether to use a preemptible VM for this pipeline. The "resource"
        section of the pipeline-file must also set preemptible to "true" for
        this flag to take effect.

OTHER FLAGS
     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk in GB.

        The boot disk size must be large enough to accommodate all Docker
        images from each action in the pipeline at the same time. If not
        specified, a small but reasonable default value is used.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     Location resource - The Google Cloud location to run the pipeline. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --location on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property lifesciences/location with a fully specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location or fully qualified identifier for the location. To
          set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property lifesciences/location.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE; default="n1-standard-1"
        The type of VirtualMachine to use. Defaults to n1-standard-1.

     --network=NETWORK
        The network name to attach the VM's network interface to.

        The value will be prefixed with global/networks/ unless it contains a
        /, in which case it is assumed to be a fully specified network resource
        URL.

        If unspecified, the global default network is used.

     --regions=[REGION,...]
        List of Compute Engine regions the pipeline can run in.

        If no regions are specified with the regions flag, then regions in the
        pipeline definition file will be used.

        If no regions are specified in the pipeline definition, then the
        default region in your local client configuration is used.

        At least one region or region must be specified.

        For more information on default regions, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/#set_default_zone_and_region_in_your_local_client

     --service-account-email=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL; default="default"
        The service account used on the Compute Engine VMs that run the
        pipeline. If unspecified, defaults to the Compute Engine service
        account for your project.

     --service-account-scopes=[SCOPE,...]
        List of additional scopes to be made available for this service
        account. The following scopes are always requested:

            https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform

     --subnetwork=SUBNETWORK
        The subnetwork to use on the provided network.

        If the specified network is configured for custom subnet creation, the
        name of the subnetwork to attach the instance to must be specified
        here.

        The value is prefixed with regions/*/subnetworks/ unless it contains a
        /, in which case it is assumed to be a fully specified subnetwork
        resource URL.

        If the * character appears in the value, it is replaced with the region
        that the virtual machine has been allocated in.

     --zones=[ZONE,...]
        List of Compute Engine zones the pipeline can run in.

        If no zones are specified with the zones flag, then zones in the
        pipeline definition file will be used.

        If no zones are specified in the pipeline definition, then the default
        zone in your local client configuration is used (and must be
        specified).

        For more information on default zones, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/#set_default_zone_and_region_in_your_local_client
