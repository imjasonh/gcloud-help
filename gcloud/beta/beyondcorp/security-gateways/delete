DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Delete a securityGateway

EXAMPLES
    To delete the securityGateway, run:

        $ gcloud beta beyondcorp security-gateways delete

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SecurityGateway resource - BeyondCorp SecurityGateway name using the form:
     projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/securityGateways/{security_gateway_id}
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument security_gateway on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SECURITY_GATEWAY
          ID of the securityGateway or fully qualified identifier for the
          securityGateway.

          To set the security_gateway attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument security_gateway on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the securityGateway resource. We support only
          global location.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument security_gateway on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --request-id=REQUEST_ID
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request
        ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
        ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
        guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
        the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
        request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
        request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.
        This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID
        is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

     --validate-only
        If set, validates request by executing a dry-run which would not alter
        the resource in any way.
