SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta beyondcorp client-connector services COMMAND
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) The client connector service is used to define a common
    configuration for a group of client gateways. Client gateways refer to the
    client connector service and are used to control the regions where you want
    to manage user traffic. The gateways communicate with the BeyondCorp
    Enterprise enforcement system to enforce context-aware checks. The
    BeyondCorp Enterprise enforcement system uses Identity-Aware Proxy and
    Access Context Manager, a flexible BeyondCorp Enterprise zero trust policy
    engine.
