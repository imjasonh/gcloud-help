DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update the resource shape of reservations within the commitment.

EXAMPLES
    To update reservations of the commitment called commitment-1 in the
    us-central1 region with values from reservations.yaml, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute commitments update-reservations commitment-1 \
            --reservations-from-file=reservations.yaml

    For detailed examples, please refer to
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/reserving-zonal-resources#modifying_reservations_that_are_attached_to_commitments

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     COMMITMENT
        Name of the commitment to update reservation.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the commitment to update reservation. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     Manage reservations that are attached to the commitment.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --reservations-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          Path to a YAML file of two reservations' configuration. Use a full or
          relative path to a local file containing the value of reservations.

       Specify source and destination reservations configuration.

         --dest-reservation=[machine-type=MACHINE-TYPE],[min-cpu-platform=MIN-CPU-PLATFORM],[require-specific-reservation=REQUIRE-SPECIFIC-RESERVATION],[reservation=RESERVATION],[reservation-zone=RESERVATION-ZONE],[vm-count=VM-COUNT]
            destination reservation configuration.
             reservation
                Name of the destination reservation to operate on.
             reservation-zone
                Zone of the destination reservation to operate on.
             vm-count
                The number of VM instances that are allocated to this
                reservation. The value of this field must be an int in the
                range [1, 1000].
             machine-type
                The type of machine (name only) which has a fixed number of
                vCPUs and a fixed amount of memory. This also includes
                specifying custom machine type following
                custom-number_of_CPUs-amount_of_memory pattern, e.g.
                custom-32-29440.
             min-cpu-platform
                Optional minimum CPU platform of the reservation to create.
             require-specific-reservation
                Indicates whether the reservation can be consumed by VMs with
                "any reservation" defined. If enabled, then only VMs that
                target this reservation by name using
                --reservation-affinity=specific can consume from this
                reservation.

                This flag argument must be specified if any of the other
                arguments in this group are specified.

         --source-reservation=[machine-type=MACHINE-TYPE],[min-cpu-platform=MIN-CPU-PLATFORM],[require-specific-reservation=REQUIRE-SPECIFIC-RESERVATION],[reservation=RESERVATION],[reservation-zone=RESERVATION-ZONE],[vm-count=VM-COUNT]
            source reservation configuration.

             reservation-zone
                Zone of the source reservation to operate on.
             vm-count
                The number of VM instances that are allocated to this
                reservation. The value of this field must be an int in the
                range [1, 1000].
             machine-type
                The type of machine (name only) which has a fixed number of
                vCPUs and a fixed amount of memory. This also includes
                specifying custom machine type following
                custom-number_of_CPUs-amount_of_memory pattern, e.g.
                custom-32-29440.
             min-cpu-platform
                Optional minimum CPU platform of the reservation to create.
             require-specific-reservation
                Indicates whether the reservation can be consumed by VMs with
                "any reservation" defined. If enabled, then only VMs that
                target this reservation by name using
                --reservation-affinity=specific can consume from this
                reservation.
