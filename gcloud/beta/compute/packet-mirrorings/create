DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a Compute Engine packet mirroring policy.

EXAMPLES
    Mirror all tcp traffic to/from all instances in subnet my-subnet in
    us-central1, and send the mirrored traffic to the collector-fr Forwarding
    Rule.

        $ gcloud beta compute packet-mirrorings create my-pm \
            --network my-network --region us-central1 \
            --mirrored-subnets my-subnet --collector-ilb collector-fr \
            --filter-protocols tcp

    Mirror all traffic between instances with tag t1 and external server with
    IP 11.22.33.44 in us-central1, and send the mirrored traffic to the
    collector-fr Forwarding Rule.

        $ gcloud beta compute packet-mirrorings create my-pm \
            --network my-network --region us-central1 --mirrored-tags t1 \
            --collector-ilb collector-fr --filter-cidr-ranges 11.22.33.44/32

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the packet mirroring to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --collector-ilb=COLLECTOR_ILB
        Forwarding rule configured as collector. This must be a regional
        forwarding rule (in the same region) with load balancing scheme
        INTERNAL and isMirroringCollector set to true.

        You can provide this as the full URL to the forwarding rule, partial
        URL, or name. For example, the following are valid values:
        ◆ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/
          regions/us-central1/forwardingRules/fr-1
        ◆ projects/myproject/regions/us-central1/forwardingRules/fr-1
        ◆ fr-1

     --network=NETWORK
        Network for this packet mirroring. Only the packets in this network
        will be mirrored. It is mandatory that all mirrored VMs have a network
        interface controller (NIC) in the given network. All mirrored
        subnetworks should belong to the given network.

        You can provide this as the full URL to the network, partial URL, or
        name. For example, the following are valid values:
        ◆ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/
          global/networks/network-1
        ◆ projects/myproject/global/networks/network-1
        ◆ network-1

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Optional, textual description for the packet mirroring.

     --enable
        Enable or disable the packet-mirroring. Enabled by default, use
        --no-enable to disable.

     --filter-cidr-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE,...]
        List of IP CIDR ranges that apply as filters on the source or
        destination IP in the IP header for packet mirroring traffic. All
        traffic between the VM and the IPs listed here will be mirrored using
        this configuration. This can be a Public IP as well. If unspecified,
        the config applies to all traffic.

     --filter-direction=DIRECTION
        ◆ For ingress, only ingress traffic is mirrored.
        ◆ For egress, only egress traffic is mirrored.
        ◆ For both (default), both directions are mirrored. DIRECTION must be
          one of: both, egress, ingress.

     --filter-protocols=[PROTOCOL,...]
        List of IP protocols that apply as filters for packet mirroring
        traffic. If unspecified, the packet mirroring applies to all traffic.
        PROTOCOL can be one of tcp, udp, icmp, esp, ah, ipip, sctp, or an IANA
        protocol number.

     --mirrored-instances=[INSTANCE,...]
        List of instances to be mirrored. You can provide this as the full or
        valid partial URL to the instance. For example, the following are valid
        values:
        ◆ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/
          zones/us-central1-a/instances/instance-
        ◆ projects/myproject/zones/us-central1-a/instances/instance-1

     --mirrored-subnets=[SUBNET,...]
        List of subnets to be mirrored. You can provide this as the full URL to
        the subnet, partial URL, or name. For example, the following are valid
        values:
        ◆ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/
          regions/us-central1/subnetworks/subnet-1
        ◆ projects/myproject/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/subnet-1
        ◆ subnet-1

     --mirrored-tags=[TAG,...]
        List of virtual machine instance tags to be mirrored.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        The virtual machines with the provided tags must live in zones
        contained in the same region as this packet mirroring.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the packet mirroring to create. Overrides the default
        compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
