NAME
    gcloud beta compute os-config os-upgrade - upgrade the instances OS version

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute os-config os-upgrade INSTANCE_NAME
        --source-os=SOURCE_OS --target-os=TARGET_OS [--async] [--auto-rollback]
        [--no-create-machine-backup] [--log-location=LOG_LOCATION]
        [--timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute os-config os-upgrade upgrades the instance's OS
    version.

    OS Upgrade involves:
      ▪ Create a snapshot and/or machine image for the instance.
      ▪ Create an install media disk and attach it to the instance.
      ▪ Upgrade the OS version.
      ▪ Cleanup install media disk after upgrade.

    Virtual instances, snapshots, machine images, and disks in Compute Engine
    and files stored on Cloud Storage incur charges. See
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/importing-virtual-disks#resource_cleanup.

EXAMPLES
    To upgrade a instance named my-instance from windows-2008r2 to
    windows-2012r2, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute os-config os-upgrade my-instance \
            --source-os=windows-2008r2 --target-os=windows-2012r2

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to os-upgrade. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --source-os=SOURCE_OS
        OS version of the source instance to upgrade. SOURCE_OS must be (only
        one value is supported): windows-2008r2.

     --target-os=TARGET_OS
        Version of the OS after upgrade. TARGET_OS must be (only one value is
        supported): windows-2012r2.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --auto-rollback
        When auto rollback is enabled, the instance and its resources are
        restored to their original state. Otherwise, the instance and any
        temporary resources are left in the intermediate state of the time of
        failure. This is useful for debugging.

     --create-machine-backup
        When enabled, a machine image is created that backs up the original
        state of your instance. Enabled by default, use
        --no-create-machine-backup to disable.

     --log-location=LOG_LOCATION
        Directory in Cloud Storage to hold build logs. If not set,
        gs://<project num>.cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/ is created
        and used.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"
        Maximum time an upgrade can last before it fails as "TIMEOUT". For
        example, if you specify 2h, the process fails after 2 hours. See $
        gcloud topic datetimes for information about duration formats.

        This timeout option has a maximum value of 24 hours.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to os-upgrade. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
