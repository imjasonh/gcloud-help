NAME
    gcloud beta compute os-config guest-policies lookup - display the guest
        policies that are applied to an instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute os-config guest-policies lookup INSTANCE_NAME
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

EXAMPLES
    To view all guest policies that are applied to an instance named
    my-instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute os-config guest-policies lookup my-instance

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to look up guest policies for. For details on
        valid instance names, refer to the criteria documented under the field
        'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to look up guest policies for. If not specified,
        you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud
        attempts to identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in
        your currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute os-config guest-policies lookup
