NAME
    gcloud beta compute url-maps add-host-rule - add a rule to a URL map to map
        hosts to a path matcher

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute url-maps add-host-rule URL_MAP --hosts=HOST,[HOST,...]
        --path-matcher-name=PATH_MATCHER_NAME [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute url-maps add-host-rule is used to add a mapping
    of hosts to a path matcher in a URL map. The mapping will match the host
    component of HTTP requests to path matchers which in turn map the request
    to a backend service. Before adding a host rule, at least one path matcher
    must exist in the URL map to take care of the path component of the
    requests. gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher or gcloud compute
    url-maps edit can be used to add path matchers.

EXAMPLES
    To create a host rule mapping the *-foo.example.com and example.com hosts
    to the www path matcher, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute url-maps add-host-rule MY-URL-MAP \
            --hosts='*-foo.example.com,example.com' --path-matcher-name=www

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL_MAP
        Name of the URL map to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --hosts=HOST,[HOST,...]
        The set of hosts to match requests against. Each host must be a fully
        qualified domain name (FQDN) with the exception that the host can begin
        with a ``*'' or ``*-''. ``*'' acts as a glob and will match any string
        of atoms to the left where an atom is separated by dots (``.'') or
        dashes (``-'').

     --path-matcher-name=PATH_MATCHER_NAME
        The name of the path matcher to use if a request matches this host
        rule. The path matcher must already exist in the URL map (see gcloud
        compute url-maps add-path-matcher).

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the host rule.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the URL map is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the URL map to operate on. If not specified, you might be
          prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute url-maps add-host-rule

        $ gcloud alpha compute url-maps add-host-rule
