NAME
    gcloud beta compute start-iap-tunnel - starts an IAP TCP forwarding tunnel

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute start-iap-tunnel INSTANCE_NAME INSTANCE_PORT
        [--iap-tunnel-disable-connection-check]
        [--local-host-port=LOCAL_HOST_PORT; default="localhost:0"]
        [--zone=ZONE]
        [--network=NETWORK --region=REGION : --dest-group=DEST_GROUP]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Starts a tunnel to Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy for TCP forwarding
    through which another process can create a connection (eg. SSH, RDP) to a
    Google Compute Engine instance.

    To learn more, see the IAP for TCP forwarding documentation
    (https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/tcp-forwarding-overview).

EXAMPLES
    To open a tunnel to the instances's RDP port on an arbitrary local port,
    run:

        $ gcloud beta compute start-iap-tunnel my-instance 3389

    To open a tunnel to the instance's RDP port on a specific local port, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute start-iap-tunnel my-instance 3389 \
            --local-host-port=localhost:3333

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

     INSTANCE_PORT
        The name or number of the instance's port to connect to.

FLAGS
     --iap-tunnel-disable-connection-check
        Disables the immediate check of the connection.

     --local-host-port=LOCAL_HOST_PORT; default="localhost:0"
        LOCAL_HOST:LOCAL_PORT on which gcloud should bind and listen for
        connections that should be tunneled.

        LOCAL_PORT may be omitted, in which case it is treated as 0 and an
        arbitrary unused local port is chosen. The colon also may be omitted in
        that case.

        If LOCAL_PORT is 0, an arbitrary unused local port is chosen.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     --network=NETWORK
        Configures the VPC network to use when connecting via IP address or
        FQDN.

     --region=REGION
        Configures the region to use when connecting via IP address or FQDN.

     --dest-group=DEST_GROUP
        Configures the destination group to use when connecting via IP address
        or FQDN.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute start-iap-tunnel
