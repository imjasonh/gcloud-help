NAME
    gcloud beta compute target-instances delete - delete target instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute target-instances delete NAME [NAME ...] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute target-instances delete deletes one or more
    Compute Engine target instances. Target instances can be deleted only if
    they are not being used by any other resources like forwarding rules.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the target instances to delete.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the target instances to delete. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
