DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-templates create facilitates the
    creation of Compute Engine virtual machine instance templates. Instance
    templates are global resources, and can be used to create instances in any
    zone.

EXAMPLES
    To create an instance template named 'INSTANCE-TEMPLATE' with the 'n2' vm
    type, '9GB' memory, and 2 CPU cores, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-templates create INSTANCE-TEMPLATE \
            --custom-vm-type=n2 --custom-cpu=2 --custom-memory=9GB

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the instance template to create.

FLAGS
     --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
        Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

         type
            The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
            accelerator to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute
            accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
            types.

         count
            Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default
            value is 1.

     --boot-disk-auto-delete
        Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted.
        Enabled by default, use --no-boot-disk-auto-delete to disable.

     --boot-disk-device-name=BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
        The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This
        option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
        opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

     --boot-disk-provisioned-iops=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_IOPS
        Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the number
        of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value must be
        between 10,000 and 120,000.

     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
        terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. The
        minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a
        multiple of 1 GB. Limit boot disk size to 2 TB to account for MBR
        partition table limitations. Default size unit is GB.

     --boot-disk-type=BOOT_DISK_TYPE
        The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
        compute disk-types list.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
        non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

     --confidential-compute
        The instance boots with Confidential Computing enabled. Confidential
        Computing is based on Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), an AMD
        virtualization feature for running confidential instances.

     --configure-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        This option has effect only when used with --source-instance. It allows
        you to override how the source-instance's disks are defined in the
        template.

         auto-delete
            If true, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when
            the instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached
            from the instance, this option won't apply. If not provided, the
            setting is copied from the source instance. Allowed values of the
            flag are: false, no, true, and yes.

         device-name
            Name of the device.

         instantiate-from
            Specifies whether to include the disk and which image to use. Valid
            values are: attach-read-only, blank, custom-image, do-not-include,
            source-image, source-image-family

         custom-image
            The custom image to use if custom-image is specified for
            instantiate-from.

     --create-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

         name
            Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if
            more than one instance is being created.

         description
            Optional textual description for the disk being created.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default.

         image
            Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized
            with. A new disk will be created based on the given image. To view
            a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud compute images
            list. It is best practice to use image when a specific version of
            an image is needed. If both image and image-family flags are
            omitted a blank disk will be created.

         image-family
            The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will
            be initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux
            distributions, some of which are available as both regular and
            Shielded VM images. When a family is specified instead of an image,
            the latest non-deprecated image associated with that family is
            used. It is best practice to use --image-family when the latest
            version of an image is needed.

         image-project
            The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
            references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
            image-project. A full list of available image projects can be
            generated by running gcloud compute images list.

            ▸ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
              provided.
            ▸ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
              projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to
              be used.
            ▸ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided,
              the current default project is used.

         size
            The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
            a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,
            or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte
            disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the
            default image size will be used for the new disk.

         type
            The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $
            gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
            pd-standard.

         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used.

         provisioned-iops
            Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the
            number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value
            must be between 10,000 and 120,000.

         disk-resource-policy
            Resource policy to apply to the disk. Specify a full or partial
            URL. For example:
            ▸ https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy
            ▸ projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy

            For more information, see the following docs:
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/resource-policies/
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The instance will use
            the first partition of the disk for its root file system. The
            default value for this is no.

         kms-key
            Fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name that will protect the
            disk.

            This can either be the fully qualified path or the name.

            The fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name format is:
            projects/<kms-project>/locations/<kms-location>/keyRings/<kms-keyring>/
            cryptoKeys/<key-name>.

            If the value is not fully qualified then kms-location, kms-keyring,
            and optionally kms-project are required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-project
            Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the
            disk.

            If the project is not specified then the project where the disk is
            being created will be used.

            If this flag is set then key-location, kms-keyring, and kms-key are
            required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-location
            Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the
            disk.

            All Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a list
            of possible locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'. If this flag
            is set then kms-keyring and kms-key are required. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-keyring
            The keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will
            protect the disk.

            If this flag is set then kms-location and kms-key are required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         multi-writer
            If yes, the disk is created in multi-writer mode so that it can be
            attached with read-write access to two VMs. The default value is
            no. The multi-writer feature requires specialized filesystems,
            among other restrictions. For more information, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/sharing-disks-between-vms.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description for the instance template.

     --disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[boot=BOOT],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[name=NAME]
        Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified must
        already exist.

         name
            The disk to attach to the instances. When creating more than one
            instance and using this property, the only valid mode for attaching
            the disk is read-only (see mode below).

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default. It is an error for mode to be rw when creating more than
            one instance because read-write disks can only be attached to a
            single instance.

         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machines
            will use the first partition of the disk for their root file
            systems. The default value for this is no.

         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used.

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

     --[no-]enable-nested-virtualization
        If set to true, enables nested virtualization for the instance. Use
        --enable-nested-virtualization to enable and
        --no-enable-nested-virtualization to disable.

     --[no-]enable-uefi-networking
        If set to true, enables UEFI networking for the instance creation. Use
        --enable-uefi-networking to enable and --no-enable-uefi-networking to
        disable.

     --host-error-timeout-seconds=HOST_ERROR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
        The timeout in seconds for host error detection. The value must be set
        with 30 second increments, with a range of 90 to 330 seconds. If unset,
        the default behavior of the host error recovery is used.

     --instance-termination-action=INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION
        Specifies the termination action that will be taken upon VM preemption.
        INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION must be one of:

         DELETE
            Permanently delete the VM.
         STOP
            Default. Stop the VM without preserving memory. The VM can be
            restarted later.

     --ipv6-network-tier=IPV6_NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the IPv6 network tier that will be used to configure the
        instance network interface IPv6 access config. IPV6_NETWORK_TIER must
        be (currently only one value is supported):

         PREMIUM
            High quality, Google-grade network tier.

     --key-revocation-action-type=POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the instance when the KMS key of one of its
        attached disks is revoked. The default is none. POLICY must be one of:

         none
            No operation is performed.
         stop
            The instance is stopped when the KMS key of one of its attached
            disks is revoked.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --local-ssd=[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[interface=INTERFACE]
        Attaches a local SSD to the instances.

         device-name
            Optional. A name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Can only be specified if interface is SCSI. If
            omitted, a device name of the form local-ssd-N will be used.

         interface
            Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this
            SSD. Valid values are SCSI and NVME. SCSI is the default and is
            supported by more guest operating systems. NVME might provide
            higher performance.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

     --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the VMs when their host machines undergo
        maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. For more information, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/host-maintenance-options.
        MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

         MIGRATE
            The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
            temporarily impact the performance of instances during a migration
            event.
         TERMINATE
            The instances should be terminated.

     --mesh=[gke-cluster=GKE-CLUSTER],[workload=WORKLOAD]
        Controls whether the Anthos Service Mesh service proxy (Envoy) and
        agent are installed and configured on the VM. "cloud-platform" scope is
        enabled automatically to allow the service proxy to be started. Do not
        use the --no-scopes flag.

         gke-cluster
            The location/name of the GKE cluster. The location can be a zone or
            a region, e.g. us-central1-a/my-cluster.

         workload
            The workload identifier of the VM. In a GKE cluster, it is the
            identifier namespace/name of the WorkloadGroup custom resource
            representing the VM workload, e.g. foo/my-workload.

     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128
        bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for
        all metadata entries is 512 KB.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

        For startup scripts on Windows instances, the following metadata keys
        have special meanings: windows-startup-script-url,
        windows-startup-script-cmd, windows-startup-script-bat,
        windows-startup-script-ps1, sysprep-specialize-script-url,
        sysprep-specialize-script-cmd, sysprep-specialize-script-bat, and
        sysprep-specialize-script-ps1. For more information, see Running
        startup scripts (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript).

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud beta compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        You can find more information on-line:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --min-node-cpu=MIN_NODE_CPU
        Minimum number of virtual CPUs this instance will consume when running
        on a sole-tenant node.

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network that the VM instances are a part of. If --subnet
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by this --network flag. If neither is specified, the default network is
        used.

     --network-interface=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a network interface to the instance. Mutually exclusive with any
        of these flags: --address, --network, --network-tier, --subnet,
        --private-network-ip, --stack-type, --ipv6-network-tier,
        --ipv6-public-ptr-domain. This flag can be repeated to specify multiple
        network interfaces.

        The following keys are allowed:
         address
            Assigns the given external address to the instance that is created.
            Specifying an empty string will assign an ephemeral IP. Mutually
            exclusive with no-address. If neither key is present the instance
            will get an ephemeral IP.

         network
            Specifies the network that the interface will be part of. If subnet
            is also specified it must be subnetwork of this network. If neither
            is specified, this defaults to the "default" network.

         no-address
            If specified the interface will have no external IP. Mutually
            exclusive with address. If neither key is present the instance will
            get an ephemeral IP.

         network-tier
            Specifies the network tier of the interface. NETWORK_TIER must be
            one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD, FIXED_STANDARD. The default value is
            PREMIUM.

         private-network-ip
            Assigns the given RFC1918 IP address to the interface.

         subnet
            Specifies the subnet that the interface will be part of. If network
            key is also specified this must be a subnetwork of the specified
            network.

         nic-type
            Specifies the Network Interface Controller (NIC) type for the
            interface. NIC_TYPE must be one of: GVNIC, VIRTIO_NET.

         stack-type
            Specifies whether IPv6 is enabled on the interface. STACK_TYPE must
            be one of: IPV4_ONLY, IPV4_IPV6. The default value is IPV4_ONLY.

         ipv6-network-tier
            Specifies the IPv6 network tier that will be used to configure the
            instance network interface IPv6 access config. IPV6_NETWORK_TIER
            must be PREMIUM (currently only one value is supported).

         ipv6-public-ptr-domain
            Assigns a custom PTR domain for the external IPv6 in the IPv6
            access configuration of instance. If its value is not specified,
            the default PTR record will be used. This option can only be
            specified for the default network interface, nic0.

         aliases
            Specifies the IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If
            there are multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by
            semicolons.

            For example:

                --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"

                Each IP alias range consists of a range name and an CIDR netmask
                (e.g. `/24`) separated by a colon, or just the netmask.
                The range name is the name of the range within the network
                interface's subnet from which to allocate an IP alias range. If
                unspecified, it defaults to the primary IP range of the subnet.
                The IP allocator will pick an available range with the specified
                netmask and allocate it to this network interface.

     --network-performance-configs=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Configures network performance settings for the instance. If this flag
        is not specified, the instance will be created with its default network
        performance configuration.

         total-egress-bandwidth-tier
            Total egress bandwidth is the available outbound bandwidth from a
            VM, regardless of whether the traffic is going to internal IP or
            external IP destinations. The following tier values are allowed:
            [DEFAULT,TIER_1]

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the instance.
        NETWORK_TIER must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD, FIXED_STANDARD. The
        default value is PREMIUM.

     --post-key-revocation-action-type=POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the instance when the KMS key of one of its
        attached disks is revoked. The default is noop. POLICY must be one of:

         noop
            No operation is performed.
         shutdown
            The instance is shut down when the KMS key of one of its attached
            disks is revoked.

     --preemptible
        If provided, instances will be preemptible and time-limited. Instances
        might be preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and
        will only be able to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible
        instances can not be restarted and will not migrate.

     --private-ipv6-google-access-type=PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE
        The private IPv6 Google access type for the VM.
        PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of:
        enable-bidirectional-access, enable-outbound-vm-access,
        inherit-subnetwork.

     --private-network-ip=PRIVATE_NETWORK_IP
        Specifies the RFC1918 IP to assign to the instance. The IP should be in
        the subnet or legacy network IP range.

     --provisioning-model=PROVISIONING_MODEL
        Specifies provisioning model, which determines price, obtainability,
        and runtime for the VM instance. PROVISIONING_MODEL must be one of:

         SPOT
            Spot VMs are spare capacity; Spot VMs are discounted to have much
            lower prices than standard VMs but have no guaranteed runtime. Spot
            VMs are the new version of preemptible VM instances, except Spot
            VMs do not have a 24-hour maximum runtime.
         STANDARD
            Default. Standard provisioning model for VM instances, which has
            user-controlled runtime but no Spot discounts.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to attach. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --resource-manager-tags=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Specifies a list of resource manager tags to apply to the instance.

     --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...]
        A list of resource policy names (not URLs) to be added to each instance
        created using this instance template. If you attach any resource
        policies to an instance template, you can only use that instance
        template to create instances that are in the same region as the
        resource policies. Do not include resource policies that are located in
        different regions in the same instance template.

     --restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.
        Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --shielded-integrity-monitoring
        Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the
        instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy
        baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly
        trusted boot image when the instance is created. This baseline can be
        updated by using gcloud compute instances update
        --shielded-learn-integrity-policy. On Shielded VM instances, integrity
        monitoring is enabled by default. For information about how to modify
        Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.
        For information about monitoring integrity on Shielded VM instances,
        see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/integrity-monitoring."

     --shielded-secure-boot
        The instance boots with secure boot enabled. On Shielded VM instances,
        Secure Boot is not enabled by default. For information about how to
        modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --shielded-vtpm
        The instance boots with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled. A
        TPM is a hardware module that can be used for different security
        operations such as remote attestation, encryption, and sealing of keys.
        On Shielded VM instances, vTPM is enabled by default. For information
        about how to modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --source-instance=SOURCE_INSTANCE

        property value for this command invocation.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        Specifies whether IPv6 is enabled on the default network interface. If
        not specified, IPV4_ONLY will be used. STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            The network interface can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
         IPV4_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv4 addresses

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet that the VM instances are a part of. If --network
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by the --network flag.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instance. These tags allow
        network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1) for more
        details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list instances with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list instances tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     --threads-per-core=THREADS_PER_CORE
        The number of visible threads per physical core. To disable
        simultaneous multithreading (SMT) set this to 1. Valid values are: 1 or
        2.

        For more information about configuring SMT, see:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/configuring-simultaneous-multithreading.

     --visible-core-count=VISIBLE_CORE_COUNT
        The number of physical cores to expose to the instance's guest
        operating system. The number of virtual CPUs visible to the instance's
        guest operating system is this number of cores multiplied by the
        instance's count of visible threads per physical core.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --address=ADDRESS
          Assigns the given external IP address to the instance that is
          created. This option can only be used when creating a single
          instance.

       --no-address
          If provided, the instances are not assigned external IP addresses. To
          pull container images, you must configure private Google access if
          using Container Registry or configure Cloud NAT for instances to
          access container images directly. For more information, see:
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/using-nat

     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the disk. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource.

       --boot-disk-kms-key=BOOT_DISK_KMS_KEY
          ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key. To set the
          kms-key attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-key on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --boot-disk-kms-keyring=BOOT_DISK_KMS_KEYRING
          The KMS keyring of the key. To set the kms-keyring attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-keyring on the command line.

       --boot-disk-kms-location=BOOT_DISK_KMS_LOCATION
          The Cloud location for the key. To set the kms-location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-location on the command
            line.

       --boot-disk-kms-project=BOOT_DISK_KMS_PROJECT
          The Cloud project for the key. To set the kms-project attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-project on the command line;
          ▸ set the property core/project.

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value specifying the number of cores that are needed
          in the custom machine type.

          For some machine types, shared-core values can also be used. For
          example, for E2 machine types, you can specify micro, small, or
          medium.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies VM type. n1 - VMs with CPU platforms Skylake and older, n2
          - VMs with CPU platform Cascade Lake. n2 offers flexible sizing from
          2 to 80 vCPUs, and 1 to 640GBs of memory. It also features a number
          of performance enhancements including exposing a more accurate NUMA
          topology to the guest OS. The default is n1.

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
        references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
        image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated by
        running gcloud projects list.
        ◆ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        ◆ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        ◆ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new
          boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will
          have the same name as the instance. To view a list of public images
          and projects, run $ gcloud compute images list. It is best practice
          to use --image when a specific version of an image is needed.

          When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size
          can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,
          respectively.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be
          initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions,
          some of which are available as both regular and Shielded VM images.
          When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
          non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best
          practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is
          needed.

          By default, debian-11 is assumed for this flag.

     Sole Tenancy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --node=NODE
          The name of the node to schedule this instance on.

       --node-affinity-file=NODE_AFFINITY_FILE
          The JSON/YAML file containing the configuration of desired nodes onto
          which this instance could be scheduled. These rules filter the nodes
          according to their node affinity labels. A node's affinity labels
          come from the node template of the group the node is in.

          The file should contain a list of a JSON/YAML objects with the
          following fields:

           key
              Corresponds to the node affinity label keys of the Node resource.
           operator
              Specifies the node selection type. Must be one of: IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to seek for matched nodes. NOT_IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to avoid certain nodes.
           values
              Optional. A list of values which correspond to the node affinity
              label values of the Node resource.

       --node-group=NODE_GROUP
          The name of the node group to schedule this instance on.

     Specifies the reservation for instances created from this template.

       --reservation=RESERVATION
          The name of the reservation, required when
          --reservation-affinity=specific.

       --reservation-affinity=RESERVATION_AFFINITY; default="any"
          The type of reservation for instances created from this template.
          RESERVATION_AFFINITY must be one of: any, none, specific.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,
          described below.

          SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. Default
          scopes are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

       --no-scopes
          Create instance without scopes

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          A service account is an identity attached to the instance. Its access
          tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and are
          used to authenticate applications on the instance. The account can be
          set using an email address corresponding to the required service
          account.

          If not provided, the instance will use the project's default service
          account.

       --no-service-account
          Create instance without service account

     --service-proxy=[enabled],[intercept-all-outbound-traffic],[access-log=ACCESS-LOG],[exclude-outbound-ip-ranges=EXCLUDE-OUTBOUND-IP-RANGES],[exclude-outbound-port-ranges=EXCLUDE-OUTBOUND-PORT-RANGES],[mesh=MESH],[network=NETWORK],[project-number=PROJECT-NUMBER],[proxy-port=PROXY-PORT],[scope=SCOPE],[serving-ports=SERVING-PORTS],[tracing=TRACING]
        Controls whether the Traffic Director service proxy (Envoy) and agent
        are installed and configured on the VM. "cloud-platform" scope is
        enabled automatically to allow connections to the Traffic Director API.
        Do not use the --no-scopes flag.

         enabled
            If specified, the service-proxy software will be installed when the
            instance is created. The instance is configured to work with
            Traffic Director.

         serving-ports
            Semi-colon-separated (;) list of the ports, specified inside
            quotation marks ("), on which the customer's application/workload
            is serving.

            For example:

                serving-ports="80;8080"

            The service proxy will intercept inbound traffic, then forward it
            to the specified serving port(s) on localhost. If not provided, no
            incoming traffic is intercepted.

         proxy-port
            The port on which the service proxy listens. The VM intercepts
            traffic and redirects it to this port to be handled by the service
            proxy. If omitted, the default value is '15001'.

         tracing
            Enables the service proxy to generate distributed tracing
            information. If set to ON, the service proxy's control plane
            generates a configuration that enables request ID-based tracing.
            For more information, refer to the generate_request_id
            documentation for the Envoy proxy. Allowed values are ON and OFF.

         access-log
            The filepath for access logs sent to the service proxy by the
            control plane. All incoming and outgoing requests are recorded in
            this file. For more information, refer to the file access log
            documentation for the Envoy proxy.

         network
            The name of a valid VPC network. The Google Cloud Platform VPC
            network used by the service proxy's control plane to generate
            dynamic configuration for the service proxy.

         intercept-all-outbound-traffic
            Enables interception of all outgoing traffic. The traffic is
            intercepted by the service proxy and then redirected to external
            host.

         exclude-outbound-ip-ranges
            Semi-colon-separated (;) list of the IPs or CIDRs, specified inside
            quotation marks ("), that should be excluded from redirection. Only
            applies when intercept-all-outbound-traffic flag is set.

            For example:

                exclude-outbound-ip-ranges="8.8.8.8;129.168.10.0/24"

         exclude-outbound-port-ranges
            Semi-colon-separated (;) list of the ports or port ranges,
            specified inside quotation marks ("), that should be excluded from
            redirection. Only applies when intercept-all-outbound-traffic flag
            is set.

            For example:

                exclude-outbound-port-ranges="81;8080-8090"

         scope
            Scope defines a logical configuration boundary for a Gateway
            resource. On VM boot up, the service proxy reaches the Traffic
            Director to retrieve routing information that corresponds to the
            routes attached to the gateway with this scope name. When scope is
            specified, the network value is ignored. You cannot specify scope
            and mesh values at the same time.

         mesh
            Mesh defines a logical configuration boundary for a Mesh resource.
            On VM boot up, the service proxy reaches the Traffic Director to
            retrieve routing information that corresponds to the routes
            attached to the mesh with this mesh name. When mesh is specified,
            the network value is ignored. You cannot specify scope and mesh
            values at the same time.

         project-number
            Project number defines the project where Mesh and Gateway resources
            are created. If not specified, the project where the instance
            exists is used.

     --service-proxy-labels=[KEY=VALUE, ...,...]
        Labels that you can apply to your service proxy. These will be
        reflected in your Envoy proxy's bootstrap metadata. These can be any
        key=value pairs that you want to set as proxy metadata (for example,
        for use with config filtering). You might use these flags for
        application and version labels: app=review and/or version=canary.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:
