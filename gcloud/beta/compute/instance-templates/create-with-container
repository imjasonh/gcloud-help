DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-templates create-with-container creates
    a Compute Engine virtual machine instance template that runs a container
    image. To create an instance template named 'instance-template-1' that runs
    the 'busybox' image, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-templates create-with-container \
            instance-template-1              \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create a template named 'instance-template-1' that runs the
    gcr.io/google-containers/busybox image and executes 'echo "Hello world"' as
    a command, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-templates create-with-container \
            instance-template-1 \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox \
            --container-command='echo "Hello world"'

    To create a template running gcr.io/google-containers/busybox in privileged
    mode, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-templates create-with-container \
            instance-template-1 \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox \
            --container-privileged

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the instance template to create.

FLAGS
     --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
        Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

         type
            The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-t4 for NVIDIA T4) of
            accelerator to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute
            accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
            types.

         count
            Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default
            value is 1.

     --boot-disk-auto-delete
        Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted.
        Enabled by default, use --no-boot-disk-auto-delete to disable.

     --boot-disk-device-name=BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
        The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This
        option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
        opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

     --boot-disk-interface=BOOT_DISK_INTERFACE
        Indicates the interface to use for the boot disk. The value must be one
        of the following:
        ◆ SCSI
        ◆ NVME

     --boot-disk-provisioned-iops=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_IOPS
        Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the number
        of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle.

     --boot-disk-provisioned-throughput=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_THROUGHPUT
        Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk. This sets the
        number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.

     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
        terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. Disk size
        must be a multiple of 1 GB. Default size unit is GB.

     --boot-disk-type=BOOT_DISK_TYPE
        The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
        compute disk-types list.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
        non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

     --confidential-compute
        The instance boots with Confidential Computing enabled. Confidential
        Computing is based on Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), an AMD
        virtualization feature for running confidential instances.

     --container-arg=CONTAINER_ARG
        Argument to append to container entrypoint or to override container
        CMD. Each argument must have a separate flag. Arguments are appended in
        the order of flags. Example:

        Assuming the default entry point of the container (or an entry point
        overridden with --container-command flag) is a Bourne shell-compatible
        executable, in order to execute 'ls -l' command in the container, the
        user could use:

        --container-arg="-c" --container-arg="ls -l"

        Caveat: due to the nature of the argument parsing, it's impossible to
        provide the flag value that starts with a dash (-) without the = sign
        (that is, --container-arg "-c" will not work correctly).

        Default: None. (no arguments appended)

     --container-command=CONTAINER_COMMAND
        Specifies what executable to run when the container starts (overrides
        default entrypoint), eg. nc.

        Default: None (default container entrypoint is used)

     --container-env=[KEY=VALUE, ...,...]
        Declare environment variables KEY with value VALUE passed to container.
        Only the last value of KEY is taken when KEY is repeated more than
        once.

        Values, declared with --container-env flag override those with the same
        KEY from file, provided in --container-env-file.

     --container-env-file=CONTAINER_ENV_FILE
        Declare environment variables in a file. Values, declared with
        --container-env flag override those with the same KEY from file.

        File with environment variables in format used by docker (almost). This
        means:
        ◆ Lines are in format KEY=VALUE.
        ◆ Values must contain equality signs.
        ◆ Variables without values are not supported (this is different from
          docker format).
        ◆ If # is first non-whitespace character in a line the line is
          ignored as a comment.
        ◆ Lines with nothing but whitespace are ignored.

     --container-image=CONTAINER_IMAGE
        Full container image name, which should be pulled onto VM instance, eg.
        docker.io/tomcat.

     --container-mount-disk=[mode=MODE],[mount-path=MOUNT-PATH],[name=NAME],[partition=PARTITION]
        Mounts a disk to the specified mount path in the container. Multiple '
        flags are allowed. Must be used with --disk or --create-disk.

         name
            Name of the disk. If exactly one additional disk is attached to the
            instance using --disk or --create-disk, specifying disk name here
            is optional. The name of the single additional disk will be used by
            default.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

         partition
            Optional. The partition of the disk to mount. Multiple partitions
            of a disk can be mounted. Can't be used with --create-disk.

         mode
            Volume mount mode: rw (read/write) or ro (read-only). Defaults to
            rw. Fails if the disk mode is ro and volume mount mode is rw.

     --container-mount-host-path=[host-path=HOSTPATH,mount-path=MOUNTPATH[,mode=MODE],...]
        Mounts a volume by using host-path.

         host-path
            Path on host to mount from.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

         mode
            Volume mount mode: rw (read/write) or ro (read-only).

            Default: rw.

     --container-mount-tmpfs=[mount-path=MOUNTPATH,...]
        Mounts empty tmpfs into container at MOUNTPATH.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

     --container-privileged
        Specify whether to run container in privileged mode.

        Default: --no-container-privileged.

     --container-restart-policy=POLICY; default="always"
        Specify whether to restart a container on exit. POLICY must be one of:
        never, on-failure, always.

     --container-stdin
        Keep container STDIN open even if not attached.

        Default: --no-container-stdin.

     --container-tty
        Allocate a pseudo-TTY for the container.

        Default: --no-container-tty.

     --create-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

         name
            Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if
            more than one instance is being created. Must specify this option
            if attaching the disk to a container with --container-mount-disk.

         description
            Optional textual description for the disk being created.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default. It is an error to create a disk in ro mode if attaching it
            to a container with --container-mount-disk.

         image
            Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized
            with. A new disk will be created based on the given image. To view
            a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud compute images
            list. It is best practice to use image when a specific version of
            an image is needed. If both image and image-family flags are
            omitted a blank disk will be created.

         image-family
            The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will
            be initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux
            distributions, some of which are available as both regular and
            Shielded VM images. When a family is specified instead of an image,
            the latest non-deprecated image associated with that family is
            used. It is best practice to use --image-family when the latest
            version of an image is needed.

         image-project
            The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
            references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
            image-project. A full list of available image projects can be
            generated by running gcloud compute images list.

            ▸ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
              provided.
            ▸ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
              projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to
              be used.
            ▸ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided,
              the current default project is used.

         size
            The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
            a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,
            or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte
            disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the
            default image size will be used for the new disk.

         type
            The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $
            gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
            pd-standard.

         device-name
            An optional name to display the disk name in the guest operating
            system. Must be the same as name if used with
            --container-mount-disk. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N is used. If omitted and used with
            --container-mount-disk (where the name of the container mount disk
            is the same as in this flag), a device name equal to disk name is
            used.

         provisioned-iops
            Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the
            number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value
            must be between 10,000 and 120,000.

         provisioned-throughput
            Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk. This sets
            the number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.

         disk-resource-policy
            Resource policy to apply to the disk. Specify a full or partial
            URL. For example:
            ▸ https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy
            ▸ projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy

            For more information, see the following docs:
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/resource-policies/
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

         architecture
            Specifies the architecture or processor type that this disk can
            support. For available processor types on Compute Engine, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms.

         storage-pool
            The name of the storage pool in which the new disk is created. The
            new disk and the storage pool must be in the same location.

         interface
            The interface to use with the disk. The value must be one of the
            following:
            ▸ SCSI
            ▸ NVME

         multi-writer
            If yes, the disk is created in multi-writer mode so that it can be
            attached with read-write access to two VMs. The default value is
            no. The multi-writer feature requires specialized filesystems,
            among other restrictions. For more information, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/sharing-disks-between-vms.

         replica-zones
            Required for each regional disk associated with the instance.
            Specify the URLs of the zones where the disk should be replicated
            to. You must provide exactly two replica zones, and one zone must
            be the same as the instance zone.

         labels
            List of label KEY=VALUE pairs separated by : character to add to
            the disk.

            Example: Key1=Value1:Key2=Value2:Key3=Value3.

            Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
            (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values
            must contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase
            characters, and numbers.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description for the instance template.

     --disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[boot=BOOT],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[interface=INTERFACE],[mode=MODE],[name=NAME]
        Attaches an existing disk to the instances.

         name
            The disk to attach to the instances. If you create more than one
            instance, you can only attach a disk in read-only mode. By default,
            you attach a zonal disk located in the same zone of the instance.
            If you want to attach a regional disk, you must specify the disk
            using its URI; for example,
            projects/myproject/regions/us-central1/disks/my-regional-disk.

         mode
            The mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for read-only mode
            and rw for read-write mode. If omitted, rw is used as a default
            value. If you use rw when creating more than one instance, you
            encounter errors.

         boot
            If set to yes, you attach a boot disk. The virtual machine then
            uses the first partition of the disk for the root file systems. The
            default value for this is no.

         device-name
            An optional name to display the disk name in the guest operating
            system. Must be the same as name if used with
            --container-mount-disk. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N is used. If omitted and used with
            --container-mount-disk (where the name of the container mount disk
            is the same as in this flag), a device name equal to disk name is
            used.

         auto-delete
            If set to yes, the persistent disk is automatically deleted when
            the instance is deleted. However, if you detach the disk from the
            instance, deleting the instance doesn't delete the disk. The
            default value is yes.

         interface
            The interface to use for the disk. The value must be one of the
            following:
            ▸ SCSI
            ▸ NVME

     --external-ipv6-address=EXTERNAL_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given external IPv6 address to the instance that is
        created. The address must be the first IP address in the range. This
        option can be used only when creating a single instance.

     --external-ipv6-prefix-length=EXTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        The prefix length of the external IPv6 address range. This field should
        be used together with --external-ipv6-address. Only the /96 IP address
        range is supported, and the default value is 96.

     --internal-ipv6-address=INTERNAL_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given internal IPv6 address or range to the instance that
        is created. The address must be the first IP address in the range or
        from a /96 IP address range. This option can be used only when creating
        a single instance.

     --internal-ipv6-prefix-length=INTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        Optional field that indicates the prefix length of the internal IPv6
        address range. It should be used together with --internal-ipv6-address.
        Only /96 IP address range is supported and the default value is 96. If
        not set, either the prefix length from --internal-ipv6-address will be
        used or the default value of 96 will be assigned.

     --ipv6-network-tier=IPV6_NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the IPv6 network tier that will be used to configure the
        instance network interface IPv6 access config. IPV6_NETWORK_TIER must
        be (only one value is supported):

         PREMIUM
            High quality, Google-grade network tier.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --local-ssd=[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[interface=INTERFACE]
        Attaches a local SSD to the instances.

         device-name
            Optional. A name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Can only be specified if interface is SCSI. If
            omitted, a device name of the form local-ssd-N will be used.

         interface
            Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this
            SSD. Valid values are SCSI and NVME. SCSI is the default and is
            supported by more guest operating systems. NVME might provide
            higher performance.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

     --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the VMs when their host machines undergo
        maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. For more information, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/host-maintenance-options.
        MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

         MIGRATE
            The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
            temporarily impact the performance of instances during a migration
            event.
         TERMINATE
            The instances should be terminated.

     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128
        bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for
        all metadata entries is 512 KB.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

            For startup scripts on Windows instances, the following metadata
            keys have special meanings: windows-startup-script-url,
            windows-startup-script-cmd, windows-startup-script-bat,
            windows-startup-script-ps1, sysprep-specialize-script-url,
            sysprep-specialize-script-cmd, sysprep-specialize-script-bat, and
            sysprep-specialize-script-ps1. For more information, see Running
            startup scripts
            (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript).

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud beta compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        You can find more information on-line:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network that the VM instances are a part of. If --subnet
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by this --network flag. If neither is specified, the default network is
        used.

     --network-interface=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a network interface to the instance. Mutually exclusive with any
        of these flags: --address, --network, --network-tier, --subnet,
        --private-network-ip, --stack-type, --ipv6-network-tier,
        --internal-ipv6-address, --internal-ipv6-prefix-length, --ipv6-address,
        --ipv6-prefix-length, --external-ipv6-address,
        --external-ipv6-prefix-length. This flag can be repeated to specify
        multiple network interfaces.

        The following keys are allowed:
         address
            Assigns the given external address to the instance that is created.
            Specifying an empty string will assign an ephemeral IP. Mutually
            exclusive with no-address. If neither key is present the instance
            will get an ephemeral IP.

         network
            Specifies the network that the interface will be part of. If subnet
            is also specified it must be subnetwork of this network. If neither
            is specified, this defaults to the "default" network.

         no-address
            If specified the interface will have no external IP. Mutually
            exclusive with address. If neither key is present the instance will
            get an ephemeral IP.

         network-tier
            Specifies the network tier of the interface. NETWORK_TIER must be
            one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is PREMIUM.

         private-network-ip
            Assigns the given RFC1918 IP address to the interface.

         subnet
            Specifies the subnet that the interface will be part of. If network
            key is also specified this must be a subnetwork of the specified
            network.

         nic-type
            Specifies the Network Interface Controller (NIC) type for the
            interface. NIC_TYPE must be one of: GVNIC, VIRTIO_NET.

         stack-type
            Specifies whether IPv6 is enabled on the interface. STACK_TYPE must
            be one of: IPV4_ONLY, IPV4_IPV6, IPV6_ONLY. The default value is
            IPV4_ONLY.

         ipv6-network-tier
            Specifies the IPv6 network tier that will be used to configure the
            instance network interface IPv6 access config. IPV6_NETWORK_TIER
            must be PREMIUM (currently only one value is supported).

         internal-ipv6-address
            Assigns the given internal IPv6 address or range to the instance
            that is created. The address must be the first IP address in the
            range or from a /96 IP address range. This option can be used only
            when creating a single instance.

         internal-ipv6-prefix-length
            Optional field that indicates the prefix length of the internal
            IPv6 address range. It should be used together with
            internal-ipv6-address. Only /96 IP address range is supported and
            the default value is 96. If not set, either the prefix length from
            --internal-ipv6-address will be used or the default value of 96
            will be assigned.

         external-ipv6-address
            Assigns the given external IPv6 address to the instance that is
            created. The address must be the first IP address in the range.
            This option can be used only when creating a single instance.

         external-ipv6-prefix-length
            The prefix length of the external IPv6 address range. This field
            should be used together with external-ipv6-address. Only the /96 IP
            address range is supported, and the default value is 96.

         aliases
            Specifies the IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If
            there are multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by
            semicolons.

            For example:

                --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"

            Each IP alias range consists of a range name and a CIDR netmask
            (e.g. /24) separated by a colon or just the netmask. The range name
            is the name of the range within the network interface's subnet from
            which to allocate an IP alias range. If unspecified, it defaults to
            the primary IP range of the subnet. The IP allocator will pick an
            available range with the specified netmask and allocate it to this
            network interface.

         network-attachment
            Specifies the network attachment that this interface should connect
            to. Mutually exclusive with --network and --subnet flags.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the instance.
        NETWORK_TIER must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is
        PREMIUM.

     --preemptible
        If provided, instances will be preemptible and time-limited. Instances
        might be preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and
        will only be able to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible
        instances can not be restarted and will not migrate.

     --private-ipv6-google-access-type=PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE
        The private IPv6 Google access type for the VM.
        PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of:
        enable-bidirectional-access, enable-outbound-vm-access,
        inherit-subnetwork.

     --private-network-ip=PRIVATE_NETWORK_IP
        Specifies the RFC1918 IP to assign to the instance. The IP should be in
        the subnet or legacy network IP range.

     --provisioning-model=PROVISIONING_MODEL
        Specifies the provisioning model for your VM instances. This choice
        affects the price, availability, and how long your VM instances can
        run. PROVISIONING_MODEL must be one of:

         FLEX_START
            Instance is provisioned using the Flex Start provisioning model and
            has a limited runtime.
         RESERVATION_BOUND
            The VM instances run for the entire duration of their associated
            reservation. You can only specify this provisioning model if you
            want your VM instances to consume a specific reservation with
            either a calendar reservation mode or a dense deployment type.
         SPOT
            Compute Engine may stop a Spot VM instance whenever it needs
            capacity. Because Spot VM instances don't have a guaranteed
            runtime, they come at a discounted price.
         STANDARD
            The default option. The STANDARD provisioning model gives you full
            control over your VM instances' runtime.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the instance template to create. If not specified, you might
        be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...]
        A list of resource policy names (not URLs) to be added to each instance
        created using this instance template. If you attach any resource
        policies to an instance template, you can only use that instance
        template to create instances that are in the same region as the
        resource policies. Do not include resource policies that are located in
        different regions in the same instance template.

     --restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.
        Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --shielded-integrity-monitoring
        Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the
        instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy
        baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly
        trusted boot image when the instance is created. This baseline can be
        updated by using gcloud compute instances update
        --shielded-learn-integrity-policy. On Shielded VM instances, integrity
        monitoring is enabled by default. For information about how to modify
        Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.
        For information about monitoring integrity on Shielded VM instances,
        see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/integrity-monitoring."

     --shielded-secure-boot
        The instance boots with secure boot enabled. On Shielded VM instances,
        Secure Boot is not enabled by default. For information about how to
        modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --shielded-vtpm
        The instance boots with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled. A
        TPM is a hardware module that can be used for different security
        operations such as remote attestation, encryption, and sealing of keys.
        On Shielded VM instances, vTPM is enabled by default. For information
        about how to modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --[no-]skip-guest-os-shutdown
        If enabled, then, when the instance is stopped or deleted, the instance
        is immediately stopped without giving time to the guest OS to cleanly
        shut down. Use --skip-guest-os-shutdown to enable and
        --no-skip-guest-os-shutdown to disable.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        Specifies whether IPv6 is enabled on the default network interface. If
        not specified, IPV4_ONLY will be used. STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            The network interface can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
         IPV4_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv4 addresses
         IPV6_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv6 addresses

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet that the VM instances are a part of. If --network
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by the --network flag.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instance. These tags allow
        network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1) for more
        details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list instances with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list instances tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --address=ADDRESS
          Assigns the given external IP address to the instance that is
          created. This option can only be used when creating a single
          instance.

       --no-address
          If provided, the instances are not assigned external IP addresses. To
          pull container images, you must configure private Google access if
          using Container Registry or configure Cloud NAT for instances to
          access container images directly. For more information, see:
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/using-nat

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value specifying the number of cores that are needed
          in the custom machine type.

          For some machine types, shared-core values can also be used. For
          example, for E2 machine types, you can specify micro, small, or
          medium.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies a custom machine type. The default is n1. For more
          information about custom machine types, see:
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#custom_machine_types

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
        references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
        image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated by
        running gcloud projects list.
        ◆ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        ◆ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        ◆ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new
          boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will
          have the same name as the instance. To view a list of public images
          and projects, run $ gcloud compute images list. It is best practice
          to use --image when a specific version of an image is needed.

          When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size
          can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,
          respectively.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be
          initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions,
          some of which are available as both regular and Shielded VM images.
          When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
          non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best
          practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is
          needed.

          By default, debian-12 is assumed for this flag.

     Specifies the reservation for instances created from this template.

       --reservation=RESERVATION
          The name of the reservation, required when --reservation-affinity is
          one of: specific, specific-then-any-reservation or
          specific-then-no-reservation.

       --reservation-affinity=RESERVATION_AFFINITY; default="any"
          The type of reservation for instances created from this template.
          RESERVATION_AFFINITY must be one of:

           any
              Consume any available, matching reservation.
           none
              Do not consume from any reserved capacity.
           specific
              Must consume from a specific reservation.
           specific-then-any-reservation
              Prefer to consume from a specific reservation, but still consume
              any available matching reservation if the specified reservation
              is not available or exhausted.
           specific-then-no-reservation
              Prefer to consume from a specific reservation, but still consume
              from the on-demand pool if the specified reservation is not
              available or exhausted.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,
          described below.

          SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. Default
          scopes are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

            Alias                  URI

          DEPRECATION WARNING: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sqlservice
          account scope and sql alias do not provide SQL instance management
          capabilities and have been deprecated. Please, use
          https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sqlservice.admin or sql-admin to
          manage your Google SQL Service instances.

       --no-scopes
          Create instance without scopes

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          A service account is an identity attached to the instance. Its access
          tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and are
          used to authenticate applications on the instance. The account can be
          set using an email address corresponding to the required service
          account.

          If not provided, the instance will use the project's default service
          account.

       --no-service-account
          Create instance without service account
