NAME
    gcloud beta compute org-security-policies associations create - create a
        new association between a security policy and an organization or folder
        resource

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute org-security-policies associations create
        --security-policy=SECURITY_POLICY [--folder=FOLDER] [--name=NAME]
        [--organization=ORGANIZATION] [--replace-association-on-target]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute org-security-policies associations create is
    used to create organization security policy associations. An organization
    security policy is a set of rules that controls access to various
    resources.

EXAMPLES
    To associate an organization security policy under folder with ID
    ``123456789" to folder ``987654321", run:

        $ gcloud beta compute org-security-policies associations create \
            create --security-policy=123456789 --folder=987654321

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --security-policy=SECURITY_POLICY
        Security policy ID of the association.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --folder=FOLDER
        ID of the folder with which the association is created.

     --name=NAME
        Name to identify this association. If unspecified, the name will be set
        to "organization-{ORGANIZATION_ID}" or "folder-{FOLDER_ID}".

     --organization=ORGANIZATION
        ID of the organization in which the security policy is to be
        associated. Must be set if SECURITY_POLICY is display name.

     --replace-association-on-target
        By default, if you attempt to insert an association to an organization
        or folder resource that is already associated with a security policy
        the method will fail. If this is set, the existing association will be
        deleted at the same time that the new association is created.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
