DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update Compute Engine future reservations.

EXAMPLES
    To update total count, start and end time of a Compute Engine future
    reservation in us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute future-reservations update \
          my-future-reservation --total-count=1000 \
          --start-time=2021-11-10T07:00:00Z \
          --end-time=2021-12-10T07:00:00Z --zone=us-central1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FUTURE_RESERVATION
        Name of the future reservation to update.

FLAGS
     --[no-]auto-delete-auto-created-reservations
        If specified, the auto-created reservations for a future reservation
        are deleted at the end time (default) or at a specified delete time.
        Use --auto-delete-auto-created-reservations to enable and
        --no-auto-delete-auto-created-reservations to disable.

     --deployment-type=DEPLOYMENT_TYPE
        The deployment type for the reserved capacity. DEPLOYMENT_TYPE must be
        one of:

         DENSE
            DENSE mode is for densely deployed reservation blocks.
         FLEXIBLE
            FLEXIBLE mode is for highly flexible, logical reservation blocks.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description of the future reservation to create.

     --[no-]enable-emergent-maintenance
        Emergent maintenance flag for the reservation, which enrolls all the
        underlying vms, hosts and SB infrastructure to receive emergent
        maintenance notifications in advance. Use --enable-emergent-maintenance
        to enable and --no-enable-emergent-maintenance to disable.

     --planning-status=PLANNING_STATUS
        The planning status of the future reservation. The default value is
        DRAFT. While in DRAFT, any changes to the future reservation's
        properties will be allowed. If set to SUBMITTED, the future reservation
        will submit and its procurementStatus will change to PENDING_APPROVAL.
        Once the future reservation is pending approval, changes to the future
        reservation's properties will not be allowed. PLANNING_STATUS must be
        one of:

         DRAFT
            Default planning status value.
         SUBMITTED
            Planning status value to immediately submit the future reservation.

     --[no-]require-specific-reservation
        Indicate whether the auto-created reservations can be consumed by VMs
        with "any reservation" defined. If enabled, then only VMs that target
        the auto-created reservation by name using
        --reservation-affinity=specific can consume from this reservation.
        Auto-created reservations delivered with this flag enabled will inherit
        the name of the future reservation. Use --require-specific-reservation
        to enable and --no-require-specific-reservation to disable.

     --reservation-name=RESERVATION_NAME
        Name of reservations where the capacity is provisioned at the time of
        delivery of future reservations. If the reservation with the given name
        does not exist already, it is created automatically at the time of
        Approval with INACTIVE state till specified start-time. Either provide
        the reservation_name or a name_prefix.

     --scheduling-type=SCHEDULING_TYPE
        Maintenance for the reserved capacity. SCHEDULING_TYPE must be one of:

         GROUPED
            In GROUPED mode, maintenance on all reserved instances is
            synchronized.
         INDEPENDENT
            In INDEPENDENT mode, maintenance is not synchronized for this
            reservation, and each instance has its own maintenance window.

     --total-count=TOTAL_COUNT
        The total number of instances for which capacity assurance is requested
        at a future time period.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the future reservation to update. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Manage the auto-delete time properties.

          formatted as "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" where YYYY = year, MM = month, DD
          = day, HH = hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = time zone in
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, specify
          2021-11-20T07:00:00Z.

       --auto-created-reservations-duration=AUTO_CREATED_RESERVATIONS_DURATION
          Automatically deletes an auto-created reservations after a specified
          number of days, hours, minutes, or seconds. For example, specify 30m
          for 30 minutes, or 1d2h3m4s for 1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4
          seconds. For more information, see $ gcloud topic datetimes.

          delivered at the start time. Each auto-created reservation name

     Manage the properties of a shared future reservation.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-share-settings
          Clear share settings on future reservation. This will result in

         --share-setting=SHARE_SETTING
            Specify if this future reservation is shared, and if so, the type
            of sharing. If you omit this flag, this value is local by default.
            SHARE_SETTING must be one of: local, projects.

         --share-with=PROJECT,[PROJECT,...]
            If this future reservation is shared, provide a comma-separated
            list of projects that this future reservation is shared with. The

          of: TWELVE_MONTH, THIRTY_SIX_MONTH.

       --previous-commitment-terms=PREVIOUS_COMMITMENT_TERMS
          Applicable only if future reservation will deliver to an existing
          reservation with a ramp plan. When set to EXTEND, all associated
          parent Committed Used Discount's end-date/term will be extended to
          the end-time of this future reservation. Default is to extend
          previous commitment's time to the end_time of the reservation.
          PREVIOUS_COMMITMENT_TERMS must be (only one value is supported):
          EXTEND.

     Manage the specific SKU reservation properties.

                The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80)
                of accelerator to attach to instances in the reservation. Use
                gcloud compute accelerator-types list to learn about all
