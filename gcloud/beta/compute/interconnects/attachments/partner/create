NAME
    gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments partner create - create a
        Compute Engine partner interconnect attachment

SYNOPSIS

        --edge-availability-domain=AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN --router=ROUTER
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--enable-admin] [--mtu=MTU]
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments partner create is used
    to create partner interconnect attachments. A partner interconnect
    attachment binds the underlying connectivity of a provider's Interconnect
    to a path into and out of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --edge-availability-domain=AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN
        Desired edge availability domain for this attachment:
        availability-domain-1, availability-domain-2, any.

        In each metro where the Partner can connect to Google, there are two
        sets of redundant hardware. These sets are described as edge
        availability domain 1 and 2. Within a metro, Google will only schedule
        maintenance in one availability domain at a time. This guarantee does
        not apply to availability domains outside the metro; Google may perform
        maintenance in (say) New York availability domain 1 at the same time as
        Chicago availability domain 1.

        AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN must be one of:

         any
            Any Availability Domain
         availability-domain-1
            Edge Availability Domain 1
         availability-domain-2
            Edge Availability Domain 2

     --router=ROUTER
        The Google Cloud Router to use for dynamic routing.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. If not provided
        on creation, defaults to disabled. When this is enabled, the attachment
        is operational and will carry traffic. Use --no-enable-admin to disable
        it.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        passing through this interconnect attachment. Only 1440 and 1500 are
        allowed values. If not specified, the value will default to 1440.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to create. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner create

        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments partner create
