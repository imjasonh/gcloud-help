DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments dedicated create is
    used to create a dedicated interconnect attachments. An interconnect
    attachment is what binds the underlying connectivity of an interconnect to
    a path into and out of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interconnect=INTERCONNECT
        The interconnect for the interconnect attachment

     --router=ROUTER
        The Google Cloud Router to use for dynamic routing.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --bandwidth=BANDWIDTH
        Provisioned capacity of the attachment. BANDWIDTH must be one of:

         50m
            50 Mbit/s
         100m
            100 Mbit/s
         200m
            200 Mbit/s
         300m
            300 Mbit/s
         400m
            400 Mbit/s
         500m
            500 Mbit/s
         1g
            1 Gbit/s
         2g
            2 Gbit/s
         5g
            5 Gbit/s
         10g
            10 Gbit/s
         20g
            20 Gbit/s
         50g
            50 Gbit/s

     --candidate-ipv6-subnets=[IPV6_SUBNET,...]
        Up to 16 candidate prefixes that control the allocation of
        cloudRouterIpv6Address and customerRouterIpv6Address for this
        attachment. Each prefix must be in the Global Unique Address (GUA)
        space. It is highly recommended that it be in a range owned by the
        requestor. A GUA in a range owned by Google will cause the request to
        fail. Google will select an available prefix from the supplied
        candidates or fail the request. If not supplied, a /125 from a
        Google-owned GUA block will be selected.

     --candidate-subnets=[SUBNET,...]
        Up to 16 candidate prefixes that can be used to restrict the allocation
        of cloudRouterIpAddress and customerRouterIpAddress for this
        attachment. All prefixes must be within link-local address space.
        Google will attempt to select an unused /29 from the supplied candidate
        subnet(s), or all of link-local space if no subnets supplied. Google
        will not re-use a /29 already in-use by your project, even if it's
        contained in one of the candidate subnets. The request will fail if all
        /29s within the candidate subnets are in use at Google's edge.

     --cloud-router-ipv6-interface-id=INTERFACE_ID
        If supplied, the interface id (index within the subnet) to be used for
        the Cloud Router address. The id must be in the range of 1 to 6. If a
        subnet mask is supplied, it must be /125, and the subnet should either
        be 0 or match the selected subnet.

     --customer-router-ipv6-interface-id=PEER_INTERFACE_ID
        If supplied, the interface id (index within the subnet) to be used for
        the Cloud Router address. The id must be in the range of 1 to 6. If a
        subnet mask is supplied, it must be /125, and the subnet should either
        be 0 or match the selected subnet.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. If not provided
        on creation, defaults to enabled. When this is enabled, the attachment
        is operational and will carry traffic. Use --no-enable-admin to disable
        it.

     --encryption=ENCRYPTION
        Indicates the user-supplied encryption option for this interconnect
        attachment (VLAN attachment).

        Possible values are:

        NONE - This is the default value, which means the interconnect
        attachment carries unencrypted traffic. VMs can send traffic to or
        receive traffic from such interconnect attachment.

        IPSEC - The interconnect attachment carries only traffic that is
        encrypted by an IPsec device; for example, an HA VPN gateway or
        third-party IPsec VPN. VMs cannot directly send traffic to or receive
        traffic from such an interconnect attachment. To use HA VPN over Cloud
        Interconnect, the interconnect attachment must be created with this
        option.

        ENCRYPTION must be one of: IPSEC, NONE.

     --ipsec-internal-addresses=[ADDRESSES]
        List of IP address range names that have been reserved for the
        interconnect attachment (VLAN attachment). Use this option only for an
        interconnect attachment that has its encryption option set as IPSEC.
        Currently only one internal IP address range can be specified for each
        attachment. When creating an HA VPN gateway for the interconnect
        attachment, if the attachment is configured to use a regional internal
        IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP address is allocated from the IP
        address range specified here. If this field is not specified when
        creating the interconnect attachment, then when creating any HA VPN
        gateways for this interconnect attachment, the HA VPN gateway's IP
        address is allocated from a regional external IP address pool.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        passing through this interconnect attachment. Only 1440 and 1500 are
        allowed values. If not specified, the value will default to 1440.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to create. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        The stack type of the protocol(s) enabled on this interconnect
        attachment. STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            Both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are enabled on this attachment.
         IPV4_ONLY
            Only IPv4 protocol is enabled on this attachment.

     --vlan=VLAN
        Desired VLAN for this attachment, in the range 2-4093. If not supplied,
        Google will automatically select a VLAN.
