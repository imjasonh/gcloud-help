DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute interconnects create is used to create
    interconnects. An interconnect represents a single specific connection
    between Google and the customer.

    For an example, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create an interconnect of type DEDICATED, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects create example-interconnect \
            --customer-name="Example Customer Name" \
            --interconnect-type=DEDICATED \
            --link-type=LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_10G_LR \
            --location=example-zone1-1 --requested-link-count=1 \
            --noc-contact-email=noc@example.com \
            --description="Example interconnect"

    To create a Cross-Cloud Interconnect, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects create example-cc-interconnect \
            --interconnect-type=DEDICATED \
            --link-type=LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_10G_LR \
            --location=example-zone1-1 --requested-link-count=1 \
            --remote-location=example-remote-location \
            --noc-contact-email=noc@example.com \
            --description="Example Cross-Cloud Interconnect"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interconnect-type=INTERCONNECT_TYPE
        Type of the interconnect. INTERCONNECT_TYPE must be one of:

         DEDICATED
            Dedicated private interconnect.
         IT_PRIVATE
            Dedicated private interconnect. (Warning: IT_PRIVATE is deprecated,
            use DEDICATED instead.)
         PARTNER
            Partner interconnect. Only available to approved partners.

     --link-type=LINK_TYPE
        Type of the link for the interconnect. LINK_TYPE must be one of:

         LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_100G_LR
            100Gbps Ethernet, LR Optics.
         LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_10G_LR
            10Gbps Ethernet, LR Optics.
         LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_400G_LR4
            400Gbps Ethernet, LR4 Optics.

     --location=LOCATION
        The location for the interconnect. The locations can be listed by using
        the gcloud beta compute interconnects locations list command to find
        the appropriate location to use when creating an interconnect.

     --requested-link-count=REQUESTED_LINK_COUNT
        Target number of physical links in the link bundle.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --admin-enabled
        Administrative status of the interconnect. If not provided on creation,
        defaults to enabled. When this is enabled, the interconnect is
        operational and will carry traffic across any functioning linked
        interconnect attachments. Use --no-admin-enabled to disable it.

     --customer-name=CUSTOMER_NAME
        Customer name to put in the Letter of Authorization as the party
        authorized to request an interconnect. This field is required for most
        interconnects, however it is prohibited when creating a Cross-Cloud
        Interconnect.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the interconnect.

     --noc-contact-email=NOC_CONTACT_EMAIL
        Email address to contact the customer NOC for operations and
        maintenance notifications regarding this interconnect.

     --remote-location=REMOTE_LOCATION
        The remote location for a Cross-Cloud Interconnect. The remote
        locations can be listed by using the gcloud beta compute interconnects
        remote-locations list command to find the appropriate remote location
        to use when creating a Cross-Cloud Interconnect.

     --requested-features=[FEATURES,...]
        List of features requested for this interconnect. FEATURES must be one
        of:

         CROSS_SITE_NETWORK
            If specified then the interconnect is created on Cross-Site Network
            capable hardware ports. This parameter can only be provided during
            interconnect INSERT and cannot be changed using interconnect PATCH.
         L2_FORWARDING
            If specified then the interconnect is created on L2 forwarding
            capable hardware ports. This parameter can only be provided during
            interconnect INSERT and cannot be changed using interconnect PATCH.
         MACSEC
            If specified then the interconnect is created on MACsec capable
            hardware ports. If not specified, the interconnect is created on
            non-MACsec capable ports first, if available. This parameter can
            only be provided during interconnect INSERT and cannot be changed
            using interconnect PATCH.

     --resource-manager-tags=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A comma-separated list of Resource Manager tags to apply to the
        interconnect.

     --subzone=SUBZONE
        Subzone in the LOCATION specified by the --location flag. SUBZONE must
        be one of:

         a
            Subzone a.
         b
            Subzone b.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
