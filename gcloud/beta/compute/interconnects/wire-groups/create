NAME
    gcloud beta compute interconnects wire-groups create - create a Compute
        Engine wire group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute interconnects wire-groups create NAME
        --bandwidth-unmetered=BANDWIDTH_UNMETERED
        --cross-site-network=CROSS_SITE_NETWORK [--admin-enabled]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--fault-response=FAULT_RESPONSE]
        [--type=TYPE] [--validate-only] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute interconnects wire-groups create is used to
    create wire groups. A wire group represents a group of redundant wires
    between interconnects in two different metros. Each WireGroup belongs to a
    CrossSiteNetwork.

    For an example, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create a wire group, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects wire-groups create \
            example-wire-group --project my-project \
            --cross-site-network example-cross-site-network \
            --bandwidth-unmetered 1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the wire group to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --bandwidth-unmetered=BANDWIDTH_UNMETERED
        The amount of unmetered bandwidth to assign to the wire group.

     --cross-site-network=CROSS_SITE_NETWORK
        Name of the crossSiteNetwork to operate on.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --admin-enabled
        Administrative status of the wire group. If not provided on creation,
        defaults to enabled. When this is enabled, the wire group is
        operational and will carry traffic. Use --no-admin-enabled to disable
        it.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the wire group.

     --fault-response=FAULT_RESPONSE
        The fault response for the wire group. FAULT_RESPONSE must be one of:

         DISABLE_PORT
            Disable port
         NONE
            None

     --type=TYPE
        The type for the wire group. TYPE must be one of:

         BOX_AND_CROSS
            Box and cross type wire groups must have two VLAN tags. The first
            is for the same-zone pseudowire, and the second is for the
            cross-zone pseudowire.
         REDUNDANT
            Redundant type wire groups must have only one VLAN tag.
         WIRE
            Single wire type wire groups must have only one VLAN tag.

     --validate-only
        Validate the new configuration, but don't update it.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects wire-groups create
