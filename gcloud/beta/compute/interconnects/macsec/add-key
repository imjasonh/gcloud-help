NAME
    gcloud beta compute interconnects macsec add-key - add pre-shared key to a
        Compute Engine interconnect MACsec configuration

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute interconnects macsec add-key NAME --key-name=KEY_NAME
        [--start-time=START_TIME] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute interconnects macsec add-key is used to add a
    pre-shared key to MACsec configuration of interconnect.

    For an example, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To add a pre-shared key to MACsec configuration, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects macsec add-key \
            example-interconnect --key-name=default-key \
            --start-time=2021-02-01T12:12:12Z

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect to update.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --key-name=KEY_NAME
        A name of pre-shared key being added to MACsec configuration of the
        interconnect. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
        RFC1035.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --start-time=START_TIME
        A RFC3339 timestamp on or after which the key is valid. startTime can
        be in the future. If the keychain has a single key, --start-time can be
        omitted. If the keychain has multiple keys, --start-time is mandatory
        for each key. The start times of two consecutive keys must be at least
        6 hours apart.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects macsec add-key
