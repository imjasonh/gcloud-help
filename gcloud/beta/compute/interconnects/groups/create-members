DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute interconnects groups create-members is used to
    create new member interconnects in an interconnect group.

    For an example, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create interconnects interconnect1 and interconnect2 in interconnect
    group example-interconnect-group, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects groups create-members \
            example-interconnect-group --interconnect-type=DEDICATED \
            --link-type=LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_10G_LR --requested-link-count=1 \
            --facility=iad-1 --interconnect="name=interconnect1" \
            --interconnect="name=interconnect2"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect group to create members.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interconnect=[INTERCONNECT,...]
        New member interconnects to create in the interconnect group. To create
        multiple interconnects, this flag should be specified multiple times.

        Each interconnect takes in the same set of flags as the gcloud compute
        interconnects create command, except instead of a location, a facility
        must be specified. These flags are defined as a comma separated list of
        flag=value pairs.

        Example: --interconnect
        name=interconnect1,facility=iad-1,description="my
        interconnect",link-type=LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_10G_LR,requested-link-count=1,
        interconnect-type=DEDICATED,admin-enabled,
        noc-contact-email=noc@google.com,customer-name=customer-name
        requested-features=MACSEC:CROSS_SITE_NETWORK

        Note that for multiple requested-features, use a colon (:) as the
        delimiter, as the comma is used to separate the flags. Similarly, if
        you need to use a comma in another flag value, you should set an
        alternative delimiter for the --interconnect flag. Run gcloud topic
        escaping for more information.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --admin-enabled
        Administrative status of the interconnect. If not provided on creation,
        defaults to enabled. When this is enabled, the interconnect is
        operational and will carry traffic across any functioning linked
        interconnect attachments. Use --no-admin-enabled to disable it.

     --customer-name=CUSTOMER_NAME
        Customer name to put in the Letter of Authorization as the party
        authorized to request an interconnect. This field is required for most
        interconnects, however it is prohibited when creating a Cross-Cloud
        Interconnect.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the interconnect.

     --facility=FACILITY
        The facility (zone free location) to create the interconnect in.

     --intent-mismatch-behavior=INTENT_MISMATCH_BEHAVIOR
        The behavior when the intent of the interconnect group does not match
        the topology capability of the member interconnects.
        INTENT_MISMATCH_BEHAVIOR must be one of: REJECT, CREATE.

     --interconnect-type=INTERCONNECT_TYPE
        Type of the interconnect. INTERCONNECT_TYPE must be one of:

         DEDICATED
            Dedicated private interconnect.
         PARTNER
            Partner interconnect. Only available to approved partners.

     --link-type=LINK_TYPE
        Type of the link for the interconnect. LINK_TYPE must be one of:

         LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_100G_LR
            100Gbps Ethernet, LR Optics.
         LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_10G_LR
            10Gbps Ethernet, LR Optics.
         LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_400G_LR4
            400Gbps Ethernet, LR4 Optics.

     --noc-contact-email=NOC_CONTACT_EMAIL
        Email address to contact the customer NOC for operations and
        maintenance notifications regarding this interconnect.

     --requested-features=[FEATURES,...]
        List of features requested for this interconnect. FEATURES must be one
        of:

         CROSS_SITE_NETWORK
            If specified then the interconnect is created on Cross-Site Network
            capable hardware ports. This parameter can only be provided during
            interconnect INSERT and cannot be changed using interconnect PATCH.
         L2_FORWARDING
            If specified then the interconnect is created on L2 forwarding
            capable hardware ports. This parameter can only be provided during
            interconnect INSERT and cannot be changed using interconnect PATCH.
         MACSEC
            If specified then the interconnect is created on MACsec capable
            hardware ports. If not specified, the interconnect is created on
            non-MACsec capable ports first, if available. This parameter can
            only be provided during interconnect INSERT and cannot be changed
            using interconnect PATCH.

     --requested-link-count=REQUESTED_LINK_COUNT
        Target number of physical links in the link bundle.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects groups create-members

        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects groups create-members
