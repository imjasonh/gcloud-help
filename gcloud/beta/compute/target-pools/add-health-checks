NAME
    gcloud beta compute target-pools add-health-checks - add a legacy HTTP
        health check to a target pool

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute target-pools add-health-checks NAME
        --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute target-pools add-health-checks is used to add a
    legacy HTTP health check to a target pool. Legacy health checks are used to
    determine the health status of instances in the target pool. Only one
    health check can be attached to a target pool, so this command will fail if
    there as already a health check attached to the target pool. For more
    information on health checks and load balancing, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the target pool to which to add the health check.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
        Specifies an HTTP health check object to add to the target pool.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the target pool to add health checks to. If not specified,
        you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
