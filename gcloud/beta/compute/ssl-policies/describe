NAME
    gcloud beta compute ssl-policies describe - describe a Compute Engine ssl
        policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute ssl-policies describe SSL_POLICY
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute ssl-policies describe is used to display all
    data associated with a Compute Engine SSL policy in a project.

    An SSL policy specifies the server-side support for SSL features. An SSL
    policy can be attached to a TargetHttpsProxy or a TargetSslProxy. This
    affects connections between clients and the load balancer. SSL policies do
    not affect the connection between the load balancers and the backends. SSL
    policies are used by Application Load Balancers and proxy Network Load
    Balancers.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SSL_POLICY
        Name of the SSL policy to describe.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the SSL policy is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the SSL policy to describe. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
