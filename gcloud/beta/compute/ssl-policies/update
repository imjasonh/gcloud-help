NAME
    gcloud beta compute ssl-policies update - update a Compute Engine SSL
        policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute ssl-policies update SSL_POLICY
        [--custom-features=[CUSTOM_FEATURES,...]]
        [--min-tls-version=MIN_TLS_VERSION] [--profile=PROFILE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute ssl-policies update is used to update SSL
    policies.

    An SSL policy specifies the server-side support for SSL features. An SSL
    policy can be attached to a TargetHttpsProxy or a TargetSslProxy. This
    affects connections between clients and the HTTPS or SSL proxy load
    balancer. SSL policies do not affect the connection between the load
    balancers and the backends.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SSL_POLICY
        Name of the SSL policy to patch.

FLAGS
     --custom-features=[CUSTOM_FEATURES,...]
        A comma-separated list of custom features, required when the profile
        being used is CUSTOM.

        Using CUSTOM profile allows customization of the features that are part
        of the SSL policy. This flag allows specifying those custom features.

        The list of all supported custom features can be obtained using:

            gcloud compute ssl-policies list-available-features

     --min-tls-version=MIN_TLS_VERSION
        Minimum TLS version. MIN_TLS_VERSION must be one of:

         1.0
            TLS 1.0.
         1.1
            TLS 1.1.
         1.2
            TLS 1.2.

     --profile=PROFILE
        SSL policy profile. Changing profile from CUSTOM to
        COMPATIBLE|MODERN|RESTRICTED will clear the custom-features field.
        PROFILE must be one of:

         COMPATIBLE
            Compatible profile. Allows the broadest set of clients, even those
            which support only out-of-date SSL features, to negotiate SSL with
            the load balancer.
         CUSTOM
            Custom profile. Allows customization by selecting only the features
            which are required. The list of all available features can be
            obtained using:

                gcloud compute ssl-policies list-available-features

         MODERN
            Modern profile. Supports a wide set of SSL features, allowing
            modern clients to negotiate SSL.
         RESTRICTED
            Restricted profile. Supports a reduced set of SSL features,
            intended to meet stricter compliance requirements.
