DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies update is used to change
    the SSL certificate and/or URL map of existing target HTTPS proxies. A
    target HTTPS proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules which
    specify the network traffic that the proxy is responsible for routing. The
    target HTTPS proxy in turn points to a URL map that defines the rules for
    routing the requests. The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend services
    which handle the actual requests. The target HTTPS proxy also points to at
    most 15 SSL certificates used for server-side authentication. The target
    HTTPS proxy can be associated with at most one SSL policy.

EXAMPLES
    Update the URL map of a global target HTTPS proxy by running:

        $ gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies update PROXY_NAME \
            --url-map=URL_MAP

    Update the SSL certificate of a global target HTTPS proxy by running:

        $ gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies update PROXY_NAME \
            --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFIFCATE

    Update the URL map of a global target HTTPS proxy by running:

        $ gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies update PROXY_NAME \
            --url-map=URL_MAP --region=REGION_NAME

    Update the SSL certificate of a global target HTTPS proxy by running:

        $ gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies update PROXY_NAME \
            --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFIFCATE --region=REGION_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target HTTPS proxy to update.

FLAGS
     --quic-override=QUIC_OVERRIDE
        Controls whether load balancer may negotiate QUIC with clients. QUIC is
        a new transport which reduces latency compared to that of TCP. See
        https://www.chromium.org/quic for more details. QUIC_OVERRIDE must be
        one of:

         DISABLE
            Disallows load balancer to negotiate QUIC with clients.
         ENABLE
            Allows load balancer to negotiate QUIC with clients.
         NONE
            Allows Google to control when QUIC is rolled out.

     --url-map=URL_MAP
        A reference to a URL map resource. A URL map defines the mapping of
        URLs to backend services. Before you can refer to a URL map, you must
        create the URL map. To delete a URL map that a target proxy is
        referring to, you must first delete the target HTTPS proxy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       At most one of these can be specified:

         Certificate resource - certificate-manager-certificates to attach.
         This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
         arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
         project attribute:
          ▫ provide the argument --certificate-manager-certificates on the
            command line with a fully specified name;
          ▫ provide the argument --project on the command line;
          ▫ set the property core/project. To set the location attribute:
          ▫ provide the argument --certificate-manager-certificates on the
            command line with a fully specified name;
          ▫ default value of location is [global].

           --certificate-manager-certificates=[CERTIFICATE_MANAGER_CERTIFICATES,...]
              IDs of the certificates or fully qualified identifiers for the
              certificates. To set the certificate attribute:
              ◇ provide the argument --certificate-manager-certificates on
                the command line.

         --clear-ssl-certificates
            Remove any attached SSL certificates from the HTTPS proxy.

         --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[...]
            References to at most 15 SSL certificate resources that are used
            for server-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this
            list is considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the
            load balancer. The SSL certificates must exist and cannot be
            deleted while referenced by a target HTTPS proxy.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --global-ssl-certificates
            If set, the ssl certificates are global.

         --ssl-certificates-region=SSL_CERTIFICATES_REGION
            Region of the ssl certificates to operate on. If not specified, you
            might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

            To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
            compute/region property:

                $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

            A list of regions can be fetched by running:

                $ gcloud compute regions list

            To unset the property, run:

                $ gcloud config unset compute/region

            Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
            CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         Certificate map resource - The certificate map to attach. This

            fully specified name;
          ▫ provide the argument --project on the command line;
          ▫ set the property core/project. To set the location attribute:

         --clear-certificate-map
            Removes any attached certificate map from the HTTPS proxy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-ssl-policy
          Removes any attached SSL policy from the HTTPS proxy.

       --ssl-policy=SSL_POLICY
          A reference to an SSL policy resource that defines the server-side
          support for SSL features and affects the connections between clients
          and the HTTPS proxy load balancer. The SSL policy must exist and
          cannot be deleted while referenced by a target HTTPS proxy.

       At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the target HTTPS proxy is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the target HTTPS proxy to update. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          If set, the URL map is global.

       --url-map-region=URL_MAP_REGION
