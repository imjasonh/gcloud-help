DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies create is used to create
    target HTTPS proxies. A target HTTPS proxy is referenced by one or more
    forwarding rules which specify the network traffic that the proxy is
    responsible for routing. The target HTTPS proxy points to a URL map that
    defines the rules for routing the requests. The URL map's job is to map
    URLs to backend services which handle the actual requests. The target HTTPS
    proxy also points to at most 15 SSL certificates used for server-side
    authentication. The target HTTPS proxy can be associated with at most one
    SSL policy.

EXAMPLES
    If there is an already-created URL map with the name URL_MAP and a SSL
    certificate named SSL_CERTIFICATE, create a global target HTTPS proxy
    pointing to this map by running:

        $ gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies create PROXY_NAME \
            --url-map=URL_MAP --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFIFCATE

    Create a regional target HTTPS proxy by running:

        $ gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies create PROXY_NAME \
            --url-map=URL_MAP --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFIFCATE \
            --region=REGION_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target HTTPS proxy to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --url-map=URL_MAP
        A reference to a URL map resource. A URL map defines the mapping of
        URLs to backend services. Before you can refer to a URL map, you must
        create the URL map. To delete a URL map that a target proxy is
        referring to, you must first delete the target HTTPS proxy.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     Certificate map resource - The certificate map to attach. This represents
     a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project. To set the location attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ default value of location is [global].

       --certificate-map=CERTIFICATE_MAP
          ID of the certificate map or fully qualified identifier for the
          certificate map. To set the map attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the target HTTPS proxy.

     --quic-override=QUIC_OVERRIDE; default="NONE"
        Controls whether load balancer may negotiate QUIC with clients. QUIC is
        a new transport which reduces latency compared to that of TCP. See
        https://www.chromium.org/quic for more details. QUIC_OVERRIDE must be
        one of:

         DISABLE
            Disallows load balancer to negotiate QUIC with clients.
         ENABLE
            Allows load balancer to negotiate QUIC with clients.
         NONE
            Allows Google to control when QUIC is rolled out.

     --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[...]
        References to at most 15 SSL certificate resources that are used for
        server-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
        considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load
        balancer. The SSL certificates must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target HTTPS proxy.

     --ssl-policy=SSL_POLICY
        A reference to an SSL policy resource that defines the server-side
        support for SSL features and affects the connections between clients
        and the HTTPS proxy load balancer. The SSL policy must exist and cannot
        be deleted while referenced by a target HTTPS proxy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the target HTTPS proxy is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the target HTTPS proxy to create. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global-ssl-certificates
          If set, the ssl certificates are global.

       --ssl-certificates-region=SSL_CERTIFICATES_REGION
          Region of the ssl certificates to operate on. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global-url-map
          If set, the URL map is global.

       --url-map-region=URL_MAP_REGION
          Region of the URL map to operate on. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.
