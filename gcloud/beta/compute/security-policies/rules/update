DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute security-policies rules update is used to update
    security policy rules.

EXAMPLES
    To update the description and IP ranges of a rule at priority 1000, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute security-policies rules update 1000 \
            --security-policy=my-policy --description="block 1.2.3.4/32" \
            --src-ip-ranges=1.2.3.4/32

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PRIORITY
        The priority of the rule to update. Rules are evaluated in order from
        highest priority to lowest priority where 0 is the highest priority and
        2147483647 is the lowest priority.

FLAGS
     --action=ACTION
        The action to take if the request matches the match condition. ACTION
        must be one of:

         allow
            Allows the request from HTTP(S) Load Balancing.
         deny-403
            Denies the request from HTTP(S) Load Balancing, with an HTTP
            response status code of 403.
         deny-404
            Denies the request from HTTP(S) Load Balancing, with an HTTP
            response status code of 404.
         deny-502
            Denies the request from HTTP(S) Load Balancing, with an HTTP
            response status code of 503.
         rate-based-ban
            Enforces rate-based ban action from HTTP(S) Load Balancing, based
            on rate limit options.
         redirect
            Redirects the request from HTTP(S) Load Balancing, based on
            redirect options.
         redirect-to-recaptcha
            (DEPRECATED) Redirects the request from HTTP(S) Load Balancing, for
            reCAPTCHA Enterprise assessment. This flag choice is deprecated.
            Use --action=redirect and --redirect-type=google-recaptcha instead.
         throttle
            Enforces throttle action from HTTP(S) Load Balancing, based on rate
            limit options.

     --ban-duration-sec=BAN_DURATION_SEC
        Can only be specified if the action for the rule is rate-based-ban. If
        specified, determines the time (in seconds) the traffic will continue
        to be banned by the rate limit after the rate falls below the
        threshold.

     --ban-threshold-count=BAN_THRESHOLD_COUNT
        Number of HTTP(S) requests for calculating the threshold for banning
        requests. Can only be specified if the action for the rule is
        rate-based-ban. If specified, the key will be banned for the configured
        BAN_DURATION_SEC when the number of requests that exceed the
        RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD_COUNT also exceed this BAN_THRESHOLD_COUNT.

     --ban-threshold-interval-sec=BAN_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL_SEC
        Interval over which the threshold for banning requests is computed. Can
        only be specified if the action for the rule is rate-based-ban. If
        specified, the key will be banned for the configured BAN_DURATION_SEC
        when the number of requests that exceed the RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD_COUNT
        also exceed this BAN_THRESHOLD_COUNT.

     --conform-action=CONFORM_ACTION
        Action to take when requests are under the given threshold. When
        requests are throttled, this is also the action for all requests which
        are not dropped. CONFORM_ACTION must be (currently only one value is
        supported): allow.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the rule.

     --enforce-on-key=ENFORCE_ON_KEY
        Different key types available to enforce the rate limit threshold limit
        on:
        ◆ ip: each client IP address has this limit enforced separately
        ◆ all: a single limit is applied to all requests matching this rule
        ◆ http-header: key type takes the value of the HTTP header configured
          in enforce-on-key-name as the key value
        ◆ xff-ip: takes the original IP address specified in the
          X-Forwarded-For header as the key
        ◆ http-cookie: key type takes the value of the HTTP cookie configured
          in enforce-on-key-name as the key value
        ◆ http-path: key type takes the value of the URL path in the request
        ◆ sni: key type takes the value of the server name indication from
          the TLS session of the HTTPS request
        ◆ region-code: key type takes the value of the region code from which
          the request originates

        ENFORCE_ON_KEY must be one of: ip, all, http-header, xff-ip,
        http-cookie, http-path, sni, region-code.

     --enforce-on-key-name=ENFORCE_ON_KEY_NAME
        Determines the key name for the rate limit key. Applicable only for the
        following rate limit key types:
        ◆ http-header: The name of the HTTP header whose value is taken as
          the key value.
        ◆ http-cookie: The name of the HTTP cookie whose value is taken as
          the key value.

     --exceed-action=EXCEED_ACTION
        Action to take when requests are above the given threshold. When a
        request is denied, return the specified HTTP response code. When a
        request is redirected, use the redirect options based on
        --exceed-redirect-type and --exceed-redirect-target below.
        EXCEED_ACTION must be one of: deny-403, deny-404, deny-429, deny-502,
        redirect.

     --exceed-redirect-target=EXCEED_REDIRECT_TARGET
        URL target for the redirect action that is configured as the exceed
        action when the redirect type is external-302.

     --exceed-redirect-type=EXCEED_REDIRECT_TYPE
        Type for the redirect action that is configured as the exceed action.
        EXCEED_REDIRECT_TYPE must be one of: google-recaptcha, external-302.

     --preview
        If specified, the action will not be enforced.

     --rate-limit-threshold-count=RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD_COUNT
        Number of HTTP(S) requests for calculating the threshold for rate
        limiting requests.

     --rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec=RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL_SEC
        Interval over which the threshold for rate limiting requests is
        computed.

     --redirect-target=REDIRECT_TARGET
        URL target for the redirect action. Must be specified if the redirect
        type is external-302. Cannot be specified if the redirect type is
        google-recaptcha.

     --redirect-type=REDIRECT_TYPE
        Type for the redirect action. Default to external-302 if unspecified
        while --redirect-target is given. REDIRECT_TYPE must be one of:
        google-recaptcha, external-302.

     --request-headers-to-add=[REQUEST_HEADERS_TO_ADD,...]
        A comma-separated list of header names and header values to add to
        requests that match this rule.

     --security-policy=SECURITY_POLICY
        The security policy that this rule belongs to.

     Security policy rule matcher.

     At most one of these can be specified:
