        Engine service attachment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute service-attachments update NAME
        [--connection-preference=CONNECTION_PREFERENCE]
        [--consumer-accept-list=[PROJECT=LIMIT,...]]
        [--consumer-reject-list=[REJECT_LIST,...]] [--description=DESCRIPTION]

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute service-attachments update is used to update
    service attachments. A service producer creates service attachments to make
    a service available to consumers. Service consumers use Private Service
    Connect endpoints to privately forward traffic to the service attachment.

EXAMPLES
    To update the connection policy of a service attachment to be
    ACCEPT_MANUAL, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute service-attachments update \
            SERVICE_ATTACHMENT_NAME --region=us-central1 \
            --connection-preference=ACCEPT_MANUAL

    To update all supported fields of a service attachment, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute service-attachments update \
            SERVICE_ATTACHMENT_NAME --region=us-central1 \
            --connection-preference=ACCEPT_AUTOMATIC \
            --nat-subnets=MY_SUBNET1,MY_SUBNET2 --enable-proxy-protocol \
            --consumer-reject-list=PROJECT_ID1,PROJECT_ID2 \
            --consumer-accept-list=PROJECT_ID3=10,PROJECT_ID4=20

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the service attachment to update.

FLAGS
     --connection-preference=CONNECTION_PREFERENCE
        This defines the service attachment's connection preference.
        CONNECTION_PREFERENCE must be one of:

         ACCEPT_AUTOMATIC
            Always accept connection requests from consumers automatically.
         ACCEPT_MANUAL
            Only accept connection requests from consumers with the approval of
            the service provider.

     --consumer-accept-list=[PROJECT=LIMIT,...]
        Adds consumer project(s) with connection limit(s) to the accept list of
        the service attachment.

        For example, --consumer-accept-list myProjectId1=20 accepts a consumer
        project myProjectId1 with connection limit 20.

        ◆ PROJECT_ID_OR_NUM - Consumer project id or number.
        ◆ CONNECTION_LIMIT - The max number of allowed connections.

     --consumer-reject-list=[REJECT_LIST,...]
        Specifies a comma separated list of projects that are not allowed to
        connect to this service attachment. The project can be specified using
        its id or number.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the service attachment.

     --[no-]enable-proxy-protocol
        If True, then enable the proxy protocol which is for supplying client
        TCP/IP address data in TCP connections that traverse proxies on their
        way to destination servers. Use --enable-proxy-protocol to enable and
        --no-enable-proxy-protocol to disable.

     --nat-subnets=NAT_SUBNETS,[NAT_SUBNETS,...]
        The subnetworks provided by service producer to use for NAT

     --nat-subnets-region=NAT_SUBNETS_REGION
        Region of the subnetworks to operate on. If not specified, it will be
        set to the region of the service attachment. Overrides the default
        compute/region property value for this command invocation.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the service attachment to update. If not specified, you might
        be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
