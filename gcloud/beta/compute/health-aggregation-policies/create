    gcloud beta compute health-aggregation-policies create - create a health
        aggregation policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute health-aggregation-policies create
        (HEALTH_AGGREGATION_POLICY : --region=REGION) [--async]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--healthy-percent-threshold=HEALTHY_PERCENT_THRESHOLD; default=60]
        [--min-healthy-threshold=MIN_HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=1]
        [--policy-type=POLICY_TYPE; default="backend-service-policy"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a health aggregation policy.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a new health aggregation policy:

        $ gcloud beta compute health-aggregation-policies create \
            <HEALTH_AGGREGATION_POLICY_NAME> --region=<REGION> \
            --healthy-percent-threshold 60 --min-healthy-threshold 2 \
            --policy-type=BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Health aggregation policy resource - The name of the health aggregation
     policy you want to create. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument health_aggregation_policy on the command line
        with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       HEALTH_AGGREGATION_POLICY
          ID of the health aggregation policy or fully qualified identifier for
          the health aggregation policy.

          To set the health_aggregation_policy attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument health_aggregation_policy on the command
            line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Google Compute Engine region.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument health_aggregation_policy on the command
            line with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/region.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A textual description of the health aggregation policy.

     --healthy-percent-threshold=HEALTHY_PERCENT_THRESHOLD; default=60
        Can only be set if the policyType field is BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY.
        Specifies the threshold (as a percentage) of healthy endpoints required
        in order to consider the aggregated health result HEALTHY. Defaults to
        60. Must be in range [0, 100]. Not applicable if the policyType field
        is DNS_PUBLIC_IP_POLICY. Can be mutated. This field is optional, and
        will be set to the default if unspecified. Note that both this
        threshold and minHealthyThreshold must be satisfied in order for
        HEALTHY to be the aggregated result. "Endpoints" refers to network
        endpoints within a Network Endpoint Group or instances within an
        Instance Group.

     --min-healthy-threshold=MIN_HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=1
        Can only be set if the policyType field is BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY.
        Specifies the minimum number of healthy endpoints required in order to
        consider the aggregated health result HEALTHY. Defaults to 1. Must be
        positive. Not applicable if the policyType field is
        DNS_PUBLIC_IP_POLICY. Can be mutated. This field is optional, and will
        be set to the default if unspecified. Note that both this threshold and
        healthyPercentThreshold must be satisfied in order for HEALTHY to be
        the aggregated result. "Endpoints" refers to network endpoints within a
        Network Endpoint Group or instances within an Instance Group.

     --policy-type=POLICY_TYPE; default="backend-service-policy"
        Specifies the type of the healthAggregationPolicy. The only allowed
        value for regional resources is BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY. Must be
        specified when the healthAggregationPolicy is created, and cannot be
        mutated. POLICY_TYPE must be one of: backend-service-policy,
        dns-public-ip-policy.
