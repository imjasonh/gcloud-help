NAME
    gcloud beta compute health-sources create - create a health source

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute health-sources create (HEALTH_SOURCE : --region=REGION)
        --health-aggregation-policy=HEALTH_AGGREGATION_POLICY
        --sources=[SOURCES,...] [--async] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--source-type=SOURCE_TYPE; default="backend-service"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a health source.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a new health source:

        $ gcloud beta compute health-sources create <HEALTH_SOURCE_NAME> \
            --region=<REGION> --source-type=BACKEND_SERVICE \
            --sources=my-backend-service \
            --health-aggregation-policy=my-health-aggregation-policy

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Health source resource - The name of the health source you want to create.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument health_source on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       HEALTH_SOURCE
          ID of the health source or fully qualified identifier for the health
          source.

          To set the health_source attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument health_source on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Google Compute Engine region.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument health_source on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/region.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --health-aggregation-policy=HEALTH_AGGREGATION_POLICY
        URL to the health aggregation policy resource. Must be set. Must be
        regional and in the same region as the HealthSource. Can be mutated.

     --sources=[SOURCES,...]
        URLs to the source resources. Must be size 1. Must be a BackendService
        if the sourceType is BACKEND_SERVICE. The BackendService must have load
        balancing scheme INTERNAL or INTERNAL_MANAGED and must be regional and
        in the same region as the HealthSource (cross-region deployment for
        INTERNAL_MANAGED is not supported). The BackendService may use only
        IGs, MIGs, or NEGs of type GCE_VM_IP or GCE_VM_IP_PORT. The
        BackendService may not use haPolicy. Can be mutated.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A textual description of the HealthSource.

     --source-type=SOURCE_TYPE; default="backend-service"
        Specifies the type of the HealthSource. The only allowed value is
        BACKEND_SERVICE. Must be specified when the HealthSource is created,
        and cannot be mutated. SOURCE_TYPE must be (only one value is
        supported): backend-service.
