EXAMPLES
    The following command updates a new health source named "my-health-source":

            --region=<REGION> --source-type=BACKEND_SERVICE \
            --sources=my-backend-service \
            --health-aggregation-policy=my-health-aggregation-policy

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Health source resource - The name of the health source you want to create.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument health_source on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       HEALTH_SOURCE
          ID of the health source or fully qualified identifier for the health
          source.

          To set the health_source attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument health_source on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Google Compute Engine region.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument health_source on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/region.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     At least one of these must be specified:

       --description=DESCRIPTION
          A textual description of the health source.

       --health-aggregation-policy=HEALTH_AGGREGATION_POLICY
          URL to the health aggregation policy resource. Must be set. Must be
          regional and in the same region as the HealthSource. Can be mutated.

       --sources=[SOURCES,...]
          URLs to the source resources. Must be size 1. Must be a
          BackendService if the sourceType is BACKEND_SERVICE. The
          BackendService must have load balancing scheme INTERNAL or
          INTERNAL_MANAGED and must be regional and in the same region as the
          HealthSource (cross-region deployment for INTERNAL_MANAGED is not
          supported). The BackendService may use only IGs, MIGs, or NEGs of
          type GCE_VM_IP or GCE_VM_IP_PORT. The BackendService may not use
          haPolicy. Can be mutated.
