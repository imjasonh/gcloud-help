DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Routes to/from Compute Engine virtual machine instances.

    NOTE: The name filtering will cycle through all the VMs in the project.
    Depending on the size of the project, this could be a considerable amount
    of work.

    If that is the case, use the --regexp flag to filter down the amount of VMs
    considered in the filtering.

EXAMPLES
    To route to/from Compute Engine virtual machine instances, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute diagnose routes

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [NAME ...]
        If provided, show details for the specified names and/or URIs of
        resources.

     [-- TRACEROUTE_ARGS ...]
        Flags and positionals passed to the underlying traceroute call.

        The '--' argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
        left and TRACEROUTE_ARGS on the right. Example:

            $ gcloud beta compute diagnose routes example-instance -- -w 0.5 \
            -q 5 42

FLAGS
     --container=CONTAINER
        The name or ID of a container inside of the virtual machine instance to
        connect to. This only applies to virtual machines that are using a
        Container-Optimized OS virtual machine image. For more information, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers

     --dry-run
        Print the equivalent scp/ssh command that would be run to stdout,
        instead of executing it.

     --external-route-ip=EXTERNAL_ROUTE_IP
        For reverse traceroute, this will be the ip given to the VM instance to
        traceroute to. This will override all obtained ips.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled, the gcloud command-line tool will regenerate and overwrite
        the files associated with a broken SSH key without asking for
        confirmation in both interactive and non-interactive environments.

        If disabled, the files associated with a broken SSH key will not be
        regenerated and will fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environments.

     --plain
        Suppress the automatic addition of ssh(1)/scp(1) flags. This flag is
        useful if you want to take care of authentication yourself or use
        specific ssh/scp features.

     --regexp=REGEXP, -r REGEXP
        Regular expression to filter the names of the results on. Any names
        that do not match the entire regular expression will be filtered out.

     --reverse-traceroute
        If enabled, will also run traceroute from the VM to the host

     --ssh-flag=SSH_FLAG
        Additional flags to be passed to ssh(1). It is recommended that flags
        be passed using an assignment operator and quotes. This flag will
        replace occurences of %USER% and %INSTANCE% with their dereferenced
        values. Example:

            $ gcloud beta compute diagnose routes example-instance \
                --zone us-central1-a           --ssh-flag="-vvv" \
                --ssh-flag="-L 80:%INSTANCE%:80"

        is equivalent to passing the flags --vvv and -L 80:162.222.181.197:80
        to ssh(1) if the external IP address of 'example-instance' is
        162.222.181.197.

     --ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

     --strict-host-key-checking=STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING
        Override the default behavior of StrictHostKeyChecking for the
        connection. By default, StrictHostKeyChecking is set to 'no' the first
        time you connect to an instance, and will be set to 'yes' for all
        subsequent connections. STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING must be one of: yes,
        no, ask.

     --user=USER
        User for login to the selected VMs. If not specified, the default user
        will be used.

     --zones=ZONE,[ZONE,...]
        If provided, only resources from the given zones are queried.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --ssh-key-expiration=SSH_KEY_EXPIRATION
          The time when the ssh key will be valid until, such as
          "2017-08-29T18:52:51.142Z." This is only valid if the instance is not
          using OS Login. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
          formats.

       --ssh-key-expire-after=SSH_KEY_EXPIRE_AFTER
          The maximum length of time an SSH key is valid for once created and
          installed, e.g. 2m for 2 minutes. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on duration formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute diagnose routes

        $ gcloud alpha compute diagnose routes
