    'my-backend-bucket':

        $ gcloud beta compute backend-buckets set-iam-policy \
            my-backend-bucket policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       BACKEND_BUCKET
