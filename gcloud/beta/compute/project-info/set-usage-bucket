NAME
    gcloud beta compute project-info set-usage-bucket - set usage reporting
        bucket for a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute project-info set-usage-bucket
        (--bucket=BUCKET | --no-bucket) [--prefix=PREFIX]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute project-info set-usage-bucket configures usage
    reporting for projects.

    Setting usage reporting will cause a log of usage per resource to be
    written to a specified Google Cloud Storage bucket daily.

    For example, to write daily logs of the form usage_gce_YYYYMMDD.csv to the
    bucket my-bucket, run:

        $ gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket \
            --bucket=gs://my-bucket

    To disable this feature, issue the command:

        $ gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket --no-bucket

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --bucket=BUCKET
          Name of an existing Google Cloud Storage bucket where the usage
          report object should be stored. This can either be the bucket name by
          itself, such as my-bucket, or the bucket name with gs:// or
          https://storage.googleapis.com/ in front of it, such as
          gs://my-bucket. The Google Service Account for performing usage
          reporting is granted write access to this bucket. The user running
          this command must be an owner of the bucket.

          To clear the usage bucket, use --no-bucket.

       --no-bucket
          Unsets the bucket. This disables usage report storage.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --prefix=PREFIX
        Optional prefix for the name of the usage report object stored in the
        bucket. If not supplied, then this defaults to usage. The report is
        stored as a CSV file named PREFIX_gce_YYYYMMDD.csv where YYYYMMDD is
        the day of the usage according to Pacific Time. The prefix should
        conform to Google Cloud Storage object naming conventions. This flag
        must not be provided when clearing the usage bucket.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

    variants are also available:
