NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups unmanaged remove-instances - removes
        resources from an unmanaged instance group by instance name

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups unmanaged remove-instances NAME
        --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups unmanaged remove-instances
    removes instances from an unmanaged instance group using the instance name.

    This does not delete the actual instance resources but removes it from the
    instance group.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        The names of the instances to remove from the instance group.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance group to operate on. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
