NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed set-named-ports - sets the list
        of named ports for an instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed set-named-ports NAME
        --named-ports=[NAME:PORT,...] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Named ports are key:value pairs metadata representing the service
    name and the port that it's running on. Named ports can be assigned to an
    instance group, which indicates that the service is available on all
    instances in the group. This information is used by the HTTP Load Balancing
    service.

    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed set-named-ports sets the list
    of named ports for all instances in an instance group.

    Note: Running this command will clear all existing named ports.

EXAMPLES
    For example, to apply the named ports to an entire instance group:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed set-named-ports \
            example-instance-group --named-ports=example-service:1111 \
            --zone=us-central1-a

    The above example will assign a name 'example-service' for port 1111 to the
    instance group called 'example-instance-group' in the us-central1-a zone.
    The command removes any named ports that are already set for this instance
    group.

    To clear named ports from instance group provide empty named ports list as
    parameter:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed set-named-ports \
            example-instance-group --named-ports="" --zone=us-central1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --named-ports=[NAME:PORT,...]
        The comma-separated list of key:value pairs representing the service
        name and the port that it is running on.

        To clear the list of named ports pass empty list as flag value. For
        example:

            $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed set-named-ports \
                example-instance-group --named-ports ""

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the instance group to operate on. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the instance group to operate on. If not specified, you might
          be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-named-ports

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed set-named-ports
