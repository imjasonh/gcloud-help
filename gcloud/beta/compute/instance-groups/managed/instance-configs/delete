NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed instance-configs delete -
        delete per-instance configs from a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed instance-configs delete NAME
        --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        [--instance-update-minimal-action=INSTANCE_UPDATE_MINIMAL_ACTION;
          default="none"] [--no-update-instance]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed instance-configs delete
    deletes one or more per-instance configs from a Google Compute Engine
    managed instance group.

    Changes are applied immediately to the corresponding instances, by
    performing the necessary action (for example, REFRESH), unless overridden
    by providing the --no-update-instance flag.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the per-instance config from my-instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed instance-configs \
            delete my-group --region=europe-west4 --instances=my-instance

    This removes all metadata and detaches all disks that were defined in the
    per-instance config (except for disks that are also defined in the instance
    template, which remain attached).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to delete.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        Names of instances to delete instance-configs from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --instance-update-minimal-action=INSTANCE_UPDATE_MINIMAL_ACTION; default="none"
        Perform at least this action on the instance while updating, if
        --update-instance is set to true. INSTANCE_UPDATE_MINIMAL_ACTION must
        be one of:

         none
            No action
         refresh
            Apply the new configuration without stopping instances, if
            possible. For example, use refresh to apply changes that only
            affect metadata or additional disks.
         restart
            Apply the new configuration without replacing instances, if
            possible. For example, stopping instances and starting them again
            is sufficient to apply changes to machine type.
         replace
            Replace old instances according to the --replacement-method flag.

     --update-instance
        Apply the configuration changes immediately to the instance. If you
        disable this flag, the managed instance group will apply the
        configuration update when you next recreate or update the instance.

        Example: say you have an instance with a disk attached to it and you
        created a stateful configuration for the disk. If you decide to delete
        the stateful configuration for the disk and you provide this flag, the
        group immediately refreshes the instance and removes the stateful
        configuration for the disk. Similarly if you have attached a new disk
        or changed its definition, with this flag the group immediately
        refreshes the instance with the new configuration.

        Enabled by default, use --no-update-instance to disable.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to delete. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to delete. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed instance-configs delete

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed instance-configs \
            delete
