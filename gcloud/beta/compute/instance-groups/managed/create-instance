NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed create-instance - create a new
        virtual machine instance in a managed instance group with a defined
        name and optionally its stateful configuration

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed create-instance NAME
        --instance=INSTANCE
        [--stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],
          [device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[source=SOURCE]]
        [--stateful-external-ip=[address=ADDRESS],
          [auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]]
        [--stateful-internal-ip=[address=ADDRESS],
          [auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]]

        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed create-instance creates
    a virtual machine instance with a defined name and optionally its stateful
    configuration: stateful disk, stateful metadata key-values, and stateful IP
    addresses. Stateful configuration is stored in the corresponding newly
    created per-instance config. An instance with a per-instance config will
    preserve its given name, specified disks, specified metadata key-values,
    and specified internal and external IPs during instance recreation,
    auto-healing, updates, and any other lifecycle transitions of the instance.

EXAMPLES
    To create an instance instance-1 in my-group (in region europe-west4) with
    metadata my-key: my-value, a disk disk-1 attached to it as the device
    device-1, stateful internal IP 192.168.0.10 on the default interface
    (nic0), and existing address reservation my-address for stateful external
    IP on interface nic1, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed create-instance \
          my-group --region=europe-west4 --instance=instance-1 \
          --stateful-disk='device-name=foo,source=https://compute.googleap\
        is.com/compute/alpha/projects/my-project/zones/europe-west4/disks/di\
        sk-1,mode=rw,auto-delete=on-permanent-instance-deletion' \
            --stateful-metadata='my-key=my-value' \
            --stateful-internal-ip=address=192.168.0.10,\
        auto-delete=on-permanent-instance-deletion \
            --stateful-external-ip=address=/projects/example-project/\
        regions/europe-west4/addresses/my-address,interface-name=nic1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to create instance in.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instance=INSTANCE
        Name of the new instance to create.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[source=SOURCE]
        Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Managed instance
        groups preserve and reattach stateful disks on VM autohealing, update,
        and recreate events.

        You can also attach and preserve disks, not defined in the group's
        instance template, to a given instance.

        The same disk can be attached to more than one instance but only in
        read-only mode.

     --stateful-external-ip=[address=ADDRESS],[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]
        Managed instance groups preserve stateful IPs on VM autohealing,
        update, and recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to update more IPs.

        If a stateful external IP with the given interface name already exists
        in the current instance configuration, its properties are replaced by
        the newly provided ones. Otherwise, a new stateful external IP
        definition is added to the instance configuration.

         interface-name
            (Optional) Network interface name. If omitted, the default network
            interface named nic0 is assumed.

                *address*::: Static IP address to assign to the instance in one of
                the following formats:

            + Address: URL of a static IP address reservation. For example:
            projects/example-project/regions/us-east1/addresses/example-ip-name.

            + Literal: For example: 130.211.181.55.

            If the provided IP address is not yet reserved, the managed
            instance group automatically creates the corresponding IP address
            reservation. If the provided IP address is reserved, the group
            assigns the reservation to the instance.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Prescribes what should happen to an associated static
            Address resource when a VM instance is permanently deleted.
            Regardless of the value of the delete rule, stateful IP addresses
            are always preserved on instance autohealing, update, and
            recreation operations. The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete the static IP address. Instead,
              unassign the address when its instance is permanently deleted and
              keep the address reserved.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the static IP address
              reservation when the instance that it's assigned to is
              permanently deleted from the instance group; for example, when
              the instance is deleted manually or when the group size is
              decreased.

     --stateful-internal-ip=[address=ADDRESS],[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]
        Managed instance groups preserve stateful IPs on VM autohealing,
        update, and recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to update more IPs.

        If a stateful internal IP with the given interface name already exists
        in the current instance configuration, its properties are replaced by
        the newly provided ones. Otherwise, a new stateful internal IP
        definition is added to the instance configuration.

         interface-name
            (Optional) Network interface name. If omitted, the default network
            interface named nic0 is assumed.

                *address*::: Static IP address to assign to the instance in one of
                the following formats:

            + Address: URL of a static IP address reservation. For example:
            projects/example-project/regions/us-east1/addresses/example-ip-name.

            + Literal: For example: 130.211.181.55.

            If the provided IP address is not yet reserved, the managed
            instance group automatically creates the corresponding IP address
            reservation. If the provided IP address is reserved, the group
            assigns the reservation to the instance.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Prescribes what should happen to an associated static
            Address resource when a VM instance is permanently deleted.
            Regardless of the value of the delete rule, stateful IP addresses
            are always preserved on instance autohealing, update, and
            recreation operations. The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete the static IP address. Instead,
              unassign the address when its instance is permanently deleted and
              keep the address reserved.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the static IP address
              reservation when the instance that it's assigned to is
              permanently deleted from the instance group; for example, when
              the instance is deleted manually or when the group size is
              decreased.

     --stateful-metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Additional metadata to be made available to the guest operating system
        in addition to the metadata defined in the instance template.

        Stateful metadata may be used to define a key/value pair specific for
        the one given instance to differentiate it from the other instances in
        the managed instance group.

        Stateful metadata key/value pairs are preserved on instance recreation,
        autohealing, updates, and any other lifecycle transitions of the
        instance.

        Stateful metadata have priority over the metadata defined in the
        instance template. This means that stateful metadata that is defined
        for a key that already exists in the instance template overrides the
        instance template value.

        Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an equals sign.
        Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in length.
        Multiple entries can be passed to this flag, e.g., --stateful-metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to create instance in. If not
          specified, you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode
          only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to create instance in. If not
          specified, you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode
          only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.
