NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize - set managed instance
        group size

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize NAME --size=SIZE
        [--no-creation-retries] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize resize a managed
    instance group to a provided size.

    If you resize down, the Instance Group Manager service deletes instances
    from the group until the group reaches the desired size. Instances are
    deleted in arbitrary order but the Instance Group Manager takes into
    account some considerations before it chooses which instance to delete. For
    more information, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instanceGroupManagers/resize.

    If you resize up, the service adds instances to the group using the current
    instance template until the group reaches the desired size.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --size=SIZE
        Target number of running instances in managed instance group.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --creation-retries
        When instance creation fails retry it. Enabled by default, use
        --no-creation-retries to disable.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.
