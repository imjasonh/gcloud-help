NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize-requests delete - delete
        a Compute Engine managed instance group resize request

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize-requests delete
        INSTANCE_GROUP_MANAGER --resize-requests=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAMES,[...]
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize-requests delete
    deletes one or more Compute Engine managed instance group resize requests.

    You can only delete a request when it is in a state SUCCEEDED, FAILED, or
    CANCELLED.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a resize request for a managed instance group, run the following
    command:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize-requests \
            delete my-mig --resize-requests=resize-request-1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_GROUP_MANAGER
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --resize-requests=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAMES,[...]
        A list of comma-separated names of resize requests to delete.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified and
        the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
        zone (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
