NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize-requests create - create
        a Compute Engine managed instance group resize request

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize-requests create
        INSTANCE_GROUP_MANAGER --requested-run-duration=REQUESTED_RUN_DURATION
        --resize-by=RESIZE_BY --resize-request=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAME
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a Compute Engine managed instance group resize request.

EXAMPLES
    To create a resize request for a managed instance group, run the following
    command:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed resize-requests \
            create my-mig --resize-request=resize-request-1 --resize-by=1 \
            --requested-run-duration=3d1h30s

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_GROUP_MANAGER
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --requested-run-duration=REQUESTED_RUN_DURATION
        The time you need the requested VMs to run before being automatically
        deleted. The value must be formatted as the number of days, hours,
        minutes, or seconds followed by d, h, m, and s respectively. For
        example, specify 30m for a duration of 30 minutes or 1d2h3m4s for 1
        day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4 seconds. The value must be between 10m
        (10 minutes) and 7d (7 days).

     --resize-by=RESIZE_BY
        The number of VMs to resize managed instance group by.

     --resize-request=RESIZE_REQUEST_NAME
        The name of the resize request to create.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified and
        the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
        zone (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize-requests create
