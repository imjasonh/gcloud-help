NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed suspend-instances - suspend
        instances owned by a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed suspend-instances NAME
        --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...] [--force]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed suspend-instances
    suspends one or more instances from a managed instance group, thereby
    reducing the targetSize and increasing the targetSuspendedSize of the
    group.

    The command returns the operation status per instance, which might be FAIL,
    SUCCESS, or MEMBER_NOT_FOUND. MEMBER_NOT_FOUND is returned only for
    regional groups when the gcloud command-line tool wasn't able to resolve
    the zone from the instance name.

EXAMPLES
    To suspend an instance from a managed instance group in the us-central1-a
    zone, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed suspend-instances \
        example-managed-instance-group --zone=us-central1-a \
        --instances=example-instance

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        Names of instances to suspend.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --force
        Immediately suspend the specified instances, skipping the initial
        delay, if one is specified in the standby policy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
