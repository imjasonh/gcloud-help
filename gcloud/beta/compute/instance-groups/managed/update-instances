NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-instances - immediately
        update selected instances in a Compute Engine managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-instances NAME
        (--all-instances | --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...])
        [--minimal-action=MINIMAL_ACTION; default="none"]
        [--most-disruptive-allowed-action=MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ALLOWED_ACTION;
          default="replace"] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) When using a managed instance group, it's possible that your
    intended specification for a VM is different from the current state of that
    VM. For example, this can happen due to changes to the group's target
    instance template. This command enables you to initiate the update process
    on the given set of instances instantly, thus when your Managed Instance
    Group is stable you can be sure that all the changes were applied.

    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-instances allows you to
    specify the least and the most disruptive actions that can be performed
    while updating the instances. This way you can reduce the risk of rolling
    out too many changes at once. Possible actions are: none, refresh, restart
    and replace. The level of disruption to the instance is ordered as: none <
    refresh < restart < replace.

    The command returns the operation status per instance, which might be FAIL,
    SUCCESS, or MEMBER_NOT_FOUND. MEMBER_NOT_FOUND is returned only for
    regional groups when the gcloud command-line tool wasn't able to resolve
    the zone from the instance name.

EXAMPLES
    To update instances instance-1, instance-2 in my-group, with
    minimal-action=none and most-disruptive-allowed-action=restart, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-instances \
              my-group --instances=instance-1,instance2 \
              --minimal-action=none
              --most-disruptive-allowed-action=restart

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --all-instances
          Update all instances in the group.

       --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
          Names of instances to update.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --minimal-action=MINIMAL_ACTION; default="none"
        Use this flag to minimize disruption as much as possible or to apply a
        more disruptive action than is strictly necessary. The MIG performs at
        least this action on each instance while updating. If the update
        requires a more disruptive action than the one specified here, then the
        more disruptive action is performed. If you omit this flag, the update
        uses the minimal-action value from the MIG's update policy, unless it
        is not set in which case the default is replace.

        MINIMAL_ACTION must be one of:

         none
            No action
         refresh
            Apply the new configuration without stopping instances, if
            possible. For example, use refresh to apply changes that only
            affect metadata or additional disks.
         restart
            Apply the new configuration without replacing instances, if
            possible. For example, stopping instances and starting them again
            is sufficient to apply changes to machine type.
         replace
            Replace old instances according to the --replacement-method flag.

     --most-disruptive-allowed-action=MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ALLOWED_ACTION; default="replace"
        Use this flag to prevent an update if it requires more disruption than
        you can afford. At most, the MIG performs the specified action on each
        instance while updating. If the update requires a more disruptive
        action than the one specified here, then the update fails and no
        changes are made. If you omit this flag, the update uses the
        most-disruptive-allowed-action value from the MIG's update policy,
        unless it is not set in which case the default is replace.

        MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ALLOWED_ACTION must be one of:

         none
            No action
         refresh
            Apply the new configuration without stopping instances, if
            possible. For example, use refresh to apply changes that only
            affect metadata or additional disks.
         restart
            Apply the new configuration without replacing instances, if
            possible. For example, stopping instances and starting them again
            is sufficient to apply changes to machine type.
         replace
            Replace old instances according to the --replacement-method flag.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed update-instances

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-instances
