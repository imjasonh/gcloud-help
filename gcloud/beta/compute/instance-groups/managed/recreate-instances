NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed recreate-instances - recreate
        instances managed by a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed recreate-instances NAME
        --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed recreate-instances is
    used to recreate one or more instances in a managed instance group. The
    underlying virtual machine instances are deleted and recreated based on the
    latest instance template configured for the managed instance group.

    The command returns the operation status per instance, which might be FAIL,
    SUCCESS, or MEMBER_NOT_FOUND. MEMBER_NOT_FOUND is returned only for
    regional groups when the gcloud command-line tool wasn't able to resolve
    the zone from the instance name.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        Names of instances to recreate.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.
