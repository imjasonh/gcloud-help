DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed rolling-action
    start-update updates instances in a managed instance group, according to
    the given versions and the given update policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --version=[template=TEMPLATE,[name=NAME],...]
        Original instance template resource to be used. Each version has the
        following format: template=TEMPLATE,[name=NAME]

COMMONLY USED FLAGS
     --canary-version=[template=TEMPLATE,target-size=FIXED_OR_PERCENT,[name=NAME],...]
        New instance template resource to be used. Each version has the
        following format:
        template=TEMPLATE,target-size=FIXED_OR_PERCENT,[name=NAME]

     --type=TYPE; default="proactive"
        Desired update type. TYPE must be one of:

         opportunistic
            Do not proactively replace VMs. Create new VMs and delete old ones
            on resizes of the group and when you target specific VMs to be
            updated or recreated.
         proactive
            Replace instances proactively.

OTHER FLAGS
     --force
        If set, accepts any original or new version configurations without
        validation.

     --max-surge=MAX_SURGE
        Maximum additional number of instances that can be created during the
        update process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of
        size to the managed instance group (e.g. 10%). Defaults to 0 if the
        managed instance group has stateful configuration, or to the number of
        zones in which it operates otherwise.

     --max-unavailable=MAX_UNAVAILABLE
        Maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during the update
        process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of size to
        the managed instance group (e.g. 10%). Defaults to the number of zones
        in which the managed instance group operates.

     --min-ready=MIN_READY
        Minimum time for which a newly created instance should be ready to be
        considered available. For example 10s for 10 seconds. See $ gcloud
        topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

     --minimal-action=MINIMAL_ACTION
        Use this flag to minimize disruption as much as possible or to apply a
        more disruptive action than is strictly necessary. The MIG performs at
        least this action on each instance while updating. If the update
        requires a more disruptive action than the one specified here, then the
        more disruptive action is performed. If you omit this flag, the update
        uses the minimal-action value from the MIG's update policy, unless it
        is not set in which case the default is replace.

        MINIMAL_ACTION must be one of:

         refresh
            Apply the new configuration without stopping VMs, if possible. For
            example, use ``refresh`` to apply changes that only affect metadata
            or additional disks.
         restart
            Apply the new configuration without replacing VMs, if possible. For
            example, stopping VMs and starting them again is sufficient to
            apply changes to machine type.
         replace
            Replace old VMs according to the --replacement-method flag.

     --most-disruptive-allowed-action=MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ALLOWED_ACTION
        Use this flag to prevent an update if it requires more disruption than
        you can afford. At most, the MIG performs the specified action on each
        instance while updating. If the update requires a more disruptive
        action than the one specified here, then the update fails and no
        changes are made. If you omit this flag, the update uses the
        most-disruptive-allowed-action value from the MIG's update policy,
        unless it is not set in which case the default is replace.

        MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ALLOWED_ACTION must be one of:

         refresh
            Apply the new configuration without stopping VMs, if possible. For
            example, use ``refresh`` to apply changes that only affect metadata
            or additional disks.
         restart
            Apply the new configuration without replacing VMs, if possible. For
            example, stopping VMs and starting them again is sufficient to
            apply changes to machine type.
         replace
            Replace old VMs according to the --replacement-method flag.

     --replacement-method=REPLACEMENT_METHOD
        Type of replacement method. Specifies what action will be taken to
        update instances. Defaults to ``recreate`` if the managed instance
        group has stateful configuration, or to ``substitute`` otherwise.
        REPLACEMENT_METHOD must be one of:

         recreate
            Recreate instances and preserve the instance names. The instance
            IDs and creation timestamps might change.
         substitute
            Delete old instances and create instances with new names.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.
