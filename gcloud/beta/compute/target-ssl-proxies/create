NAME
    gcloud beta compute target-ssl-proxies create - create a target SSL proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute target-ssl-proxies create NAME
        --backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE
        (--certificate-map=CERTIFICATE_MAP
          --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[...]) [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER; default="NONE"] [--ssl-policy=SSL_POLICY]
        [--global-ssl-policy | --ssl-policy-region=SSL_POLICY_REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute target-ssl-proxies create is used to create
    target SSL proxies. A target SSL proxy is referenced by one or more
    forwarding rules which define which packets the proxy is responsible for
    routing. The target SSL proxy points to a backend service which handle the
    actual requests. The target SSL proxy also points to at most 15 SSL
    certificates used for server-side authentication or one certificate map.
    The target SSL proxy can be associated with at most one SSL policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target SSL proxy to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE
        A backend service that will be used for connections to the target SSL
        proxy.

     At least one of these must be specified:

       Certificate map resource - The certificate map to attach. This
       represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
       arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
       attribute:
        ▸ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line with a
          fully specified name;
        ▸ provide the argument --project on the command line;
        ▸ set the property core/project. To set the location attribute:
        ▸ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line with a
          fully specified name;
        ▸ default value of location is [global].

         --certificate-map=CERTIFICATE_MAP
            ID of the certificate map or fully qualified identifier for the
            certificate map. To set the map attribute:
            ▫ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line.

       --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[...]
          References to at most 15 SSL certificate resources that are used for
          server-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
          considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load
          balancer. The SSL certificates must exist and cannot be deleted while
          referenced by a target SSL proxy.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the target SSL proxy.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER; default="NONE"
        The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend.
        PROXY_HEADER must be one of:

         NONE
            No proxy header is added.
         PROXY_V1
            Enables PROXY protocol (version 1) for passing client connection
            information.

     --ssl-policy=SSL_POLICY
        A reference to an SSL policy resource that defines the server-side
        support for SSL features and affects the connections between clients
        and the SSL proxy load balancer. The SSL policy must exist and cannot
        be deleted while referenced by a target SSL proxy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global-ssl-policy
          If set, the SSL policy is global.

       --ssl-policy-region=SSL_POLICY_REGION
          Region of the SSL policy to operate on. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:
