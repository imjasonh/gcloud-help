NAME
    gcloud beta compute disks resize - resize a disk or disks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute disks resize DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...] --size=SIZE
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute disks resize resizes a Compute Engine disk(s).

    Only increasing disk size is supported. Disks can be resized regardless of
    whether they are attached.

EXAMPLES
    To resize a disk called example-disk-1 to new size 6TB, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute disks resize example-disk-1 --size=6TB

    To resize two disks called example-disk-2 and example-disk-3 to new size
    6TB, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute disks resize example-disk-2 example-disk-3 \
           --size=6TB

    This assumes that original size of each of these disks is 6TB or less.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
        Names of the disks to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --size=SIZE
        Indicates the new size of the disks. The value must be a whole number
        followed by a size unit of GB for gigabyte, or TB for terabyte. If no
        size unit is specified, GB is assumed. For example, 10GB will produce
        10 gigabyte disks. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the disks to operate on. If not specified, you might be
          prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the disks to operate on. If not specified and the
          compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
          zone (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute disks resize

        $ gcloud alpha compute disks resize
