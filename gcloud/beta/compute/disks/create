DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute disks create creates one or more Compute Engine
    persistent disks. When creating virtual machine instances, disks can be
    attached to the instances through the gcloud compute instances create
    command. Disks can also be attached to instances that are already running
    using gcloud compute instances attach-disk.

    Disks are zonal resources, so they reside in a particular zone for their
    entire lifetime. The contents of a disk can be moved to a different zone by
    snapshotting the disk (using gcloud compute disks snapshot) and creating a
    new disk using --source-snapshot in the desired zone. The contents of a
    disk can also be moved across project or zone by creating an image (using
    gcloud compute images create) and creating a new disk using --image in the
    desired project and/or zone.

    For a comprehensive guide, including details on minimum and maximum disk
    size, refer to: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks

EXAMPLES
    When creating disks, be sure to include the --zone option. To create disks
    'my-disk-1' and 'my-disk-2' in zone us-east1-a:

        $ gcloud beta compute disks create my-disk-1 my-disk-2 \
            --zone=us-east1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
        Names of the disks to create. For details on the naming convention for
        this resource, refer to:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/naming-resources

FLAGS
     --access-mode=ACCESS_MODE
        Specifies how VMs attached to the disk can access the data on the disk.
        To grant read-only access to multiple VMs attached to the disk, set
        access-mode to READ_ONLY_MANY. To grant read-write access to only one
        VM attached to the disk, use READ_WRITE_SINGLE. READ_WRITE_SINGLE is
        used if omitted. ACCESS_MODE must be one of: READ_ONLY_MANY,
        READ_WRITE_MANY, READ_WRITE_SINGLE.

     --architecture=ARCHITECTURE
        Specifies the architecture or processor type that this disk can
        support. For available processor types on Compute Engine, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms. ARCHITECTURE must
        be one of: ARM64, X86_64.

     --confidential-compute
        Creates the disk with confidential compute mode enabled. Encryption
        with a Cloud KMS key is required to enable this option.

     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file that maps
        Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when creating,
        mounting, or taking snapshots of disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag, the CSEK is read from stdin. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the disks being created.

     --erase-windows-vss-signature
        Specifies whether the disk restored from a source snapshot should erase
        Windows specific VSS signature. See
        https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/disks/snapshot#--guest-flush

     --guest-os-features=[GUEST_OS_FEATURE,...]
        Enables one or more features for VM instances that use the image for
        their boot disks. See the descriptions of supported features at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/create-delete-deprecate-private-images#guest-os-features.
        GUEST_OS_FEATURE must be one of: GVNIC, IDPF, MULTI_IP_SUBNET,
        SEV_CAPABLE, SEV_LIVE_MIGRATABLE, SEV_LIVE_MIGRATABLE_V2,
        SEV_SNP_CAPABLE, TDX_CAPABLE, UEFI_COMPATIBLE, VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE,
        WINDOWS.

     --interface=INTERFACE
        Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk. Valid
        values are SCSI and NVME. The default is SCSI.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --licenses=[LICENSE,...]
        A list of URIs to license resources. The provided licenses will be
        added onto the created disks to indicate the licensing and billing
        policies.

     --multi-writer
        Create the disk in multi-writer mode so that it can be attached with
        read-write access to two VMs. The multi-writer feature requires
        specialized filesystems, among other restrictions. For more
        information, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/sharing-disks-between-vms.

     --physical-block-size=PHYSICAL_BLOCK_SIZE; default="4096"
        Physical block size of the persistent disk in bytes. Valid values are
        4096(default) and 16384. PHYSICAL_BLOCK_SIZE must be one of: 4096,
        16384.

     --primary-disk-project=PRIMARY_DISK_PROJECT
        Project of the primary disk for asynchronous replication.

     --provisioned-iops=PROVISIONED_IOPS
        Provisioned IOPS of disk to create. Only for use with disks of type
        pd-extreme and hyperdisk-extreme.

     --provisioned-throughput=PROVISIONED_THROUGHPUT
        Provisioned throughput of disk to create. The throughput unit is MB per
        sec. Only for use with disks of type hyperdisk-throughput.

     --replica-zones=ZONE,ZONE
        A comma-separated list of exactly 2 zones that a regional disk will be
        replicated to. Required when creating regional disk. The zones must be
        in the same region as specified in the --region flag. See available
        zones with gcloud compute zones list.

     --require-csek-key-create
        Refuse to create resources not protected by a user managed key in the
        key file when --csek-key-file is given. This behavior is enabled by
        default to prevent incorrect gcloud invocations from accidentally
        creating resources with no user managed key. Disabling the check allows
        creation of some resources without a matching Customer-Supplied
        Encryption Key in the supplied --csek-key-file. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details. Enabled by default, use --no-require-csek-key-create
        to disable.

     --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...]
        A list of resource policy names to be added to the disk. The policies
        must exist in the same region as the disk.

     --size=SIZE
        Size of the disks. The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of GB for gigabyte, or TB for terabyte. If no size unit is
        specified, GB is assumed. For example, 10GB will produce 10 gigabyte
        disks. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If disk size is not
        specified, the default size of 500GB for pd-standard disks, 100GB for
        pd-balanced disks, 100GB for pd-ssd disks, and 1000GB for pd-extreme
        will be used. For details about disk size limits, refer to:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks

     --storage-pool=STORAGE_POOL
        Specifies the URI of the storage pool in which the disk is created.

     --type=TYPE
        Specifies the type of disk to create. To get a list of available disk
        types, run gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
        pd-standard.

     --image-family-scope=IMAGE_FAMILY_SCOPE
        Sets the scope for the --image-family flag. By default, when specifying
        an image family in a public image project, the zonal image family scope
        is used. All other projects default to the global image. Use this flag
        to override this behavior. IMAGE_FAMILY_SCOPE must be one of: zonal,
        global.

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
        references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
        image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated by
        running gcloud projects list.
        ◆ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        ◆ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        ◆ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          An image to apply to the disks being created. When using this option,
          the size of the disks must be at least as large as the image size.
          Use --size to adjust the size of the disks.

          This flag is mutually exclusive with --source-snapshot and
          --image-family.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be
          initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions,
          some of which are available as both regular and Shielded VM images.
          When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
          non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best
          practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is
          needed.

       --primary-disk=PRIMARY_DISK
          Primary disk for asynchronous replication. This flag is required when
          creating a secondary disk.

       --source-disk=SOURCE_DISK
          Source disk used to create the disk(s). It is safe to delete a source
          disk after a disk has been created from the source disk. To get a
          list of disks in your current project, run gcloud compute disks list.
          This flag is mutually exclusive with --image and --source-snapshot.

          When using this option, the size of the disks must be at least as
          large as the source disk size. Use --size to adjust the size of the
          disks.

          The source disk must be in the same zone/region as the disk to be
          created.

       --source-instant-snapshot=SOURCE_INSTANT_SNAPSHOT
          Name of the source instant snapshot used to create the disks.

       --source-snapshot=SOURCE_SNAPSHOT
          Source snapshot used to create the disks. It is safe to delete a
          snapshot after a disk has been created from the snapshot. In such
          cases, the disks will no longer reference the deleted snapshot. To
          get a list of snapshots in your current project, run gcloud compute
          snapshots list. A snapshot from an existing disk can be created using
          the gcloud compute disks snapshot command. This flag is mutually
          exclusive with --image.

          When using this option, the size of the disks must be at least as
          large as the snapshot size. Use --size to adjust the size of the
          disks.

     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the disk. The 'Compute Engine Service Agent' service
     account must hold permission 'Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter'.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource.

       --kms-key=KMS_KEY
          ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key.

          To set the kms-key attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-key on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --kms-keyring=KMS_KEYRING
          The KMS keyring of the key.

          To set the kms-keyring attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-key on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-keyring on the command line.

       --kms-location=KMS_LOCATION
          The Google Cloud location for the key.

          To set the kms-location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-key on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-location on the command line;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line.

       --kms-project=KMS_PROJECT
          The Google Cloud project for the key.

          To set the kms-project attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-key on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --kms-project on the command line;
          ▸ set the property core/project.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --primary-disk-region=PRIMARY_DISK_REGION
          Region of the primary disk for asynchronous replication. The primary
          and secondary disks must not be in the same region. Overrides the
          default compute/region property value for this command invocation.

       --primary-disk-zone=PRIMARY_DISK_ZONE
          Zone of the primary disk for asynchronous replication. The primary
          and secondary disks must not be in the same region. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the disks to create. If not specified, you might be
          prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the disks to create. If not specified and the compute/zone
          property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
          (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --source-disk-region=SOURCE_DISK_REGION
          Region of the source disk. This argument is not required if the
          target disk is in the same region as the source disk. Overrides the
          default compute/region property value for this command invocation.

       --source-disk-zone=SOURCE_DISK_ZONE
          Zone of the source disk. This argument is not required if the target
          disk is in the same zone as the source disk. Overrides the default
          compute/zone property value for this command invocation.
