NAME
    gcloud beta compute disks snapshot - create snapshots of Compute Engine
        persistent disks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute disks snapshot DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...] [--async]
        [--chain-name=CHAIN_NAME] [--csek-key-file=FILE]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--guest-flush] [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--snapshot-names=SNAPSHOT_NAME,[...]] [--storage-location=LOCATION]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute disks snapshot creates snapshots of persistent
    disks. Snapshots are useful for backing up data, copying a persistent disk,
    and even, creating a custom image. Snapshots can be created from persistent
    disks even while they are attached to running instances. Once created,
    snapshots may be managed (listed, deleted, etc.) via gcloud compute
    snapshots.

    Refer to the Snapshot best practices guide.
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/snapshot-best-practices

    gcloud beta compute disks snapshot waits until the operation returns a
    status of READY or FAILED, or reaches the maximum timeout, and returns the
    last known details of the snapshot.

    Note: To create snapshots, the following IAM permissions are necessary
    compute.disks.createSnapshot, compute.snapshots.create,
    compute.snapshots.get, and compute.zoneOperations.get.

EXAMPLES
    To create a snapshot named snapshot-test of a persistent disk named test in
    zone us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute disks snapshot test --zone=us-central1-a \
            --snapshot-names=snapshot-test \
            --description="This is an example snapshot"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
        Names of the disks to operate on.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --chain-name=CHAIN_NAME
        Create the new snapshot in the snapshot chain labeled with the
        specified name. The chain name must be 1-63 characters long and comply
        with RFC1035. Use this flag only if you are an advanced service owner
        who needs to create separate snapshot chains, for example, for
        chargeback tracking. When you describe your snapshot resource, this
        field is visible only if it has a non-empty value.

     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file that maps
        Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when creating,
        mounting, or taking snapshots of disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag, the CSEK is read from stdin. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Text to describe the snapshots being created.

     --guest-flush
        Create an application-consistent snapshot by informing the OS to
        prepare for the snapshot process.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --snapshot-names=SNAPSHOT_NAME,[...]
        Names to assign to the created snapshots. Without this option, the name
        of each snapshot will be a random 12-character alphanumeric string that
        starts with a letter. The values of this option run parallel to the
        disks specified. For example,

            gcloud beta compute disks snapshot my-disk-1 my-disk-2 my-disk-3 --snapshot-names snapshot-1,snapshot-2,snapshot-3

        will result in my-disk-1 being snapshotted as snapshot-1, my-disk-2 as
        snapshot-2, and so on. The name must match the
        (?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?) regular expression, which means
        it must start with an alphabetic character followed by one or more
        alphanumeric characters or dashes. The name must not exceed 63
        characters and must not contain special symbols. All characters must be
        lowercase.

     --storage-location=LOCATION
        Google Cloud Storage location, either regional or multi-regional, where
        snapshot content is to be stored. If absent, a nearby regional or
        multi-regional location is chosen automatically.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the disks to operate on. If not specified, you might be
          prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the disks to operate on. If not specified and the
          compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
          zone (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.
