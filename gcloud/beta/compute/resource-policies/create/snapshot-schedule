DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a Compute Engine Snapshot Schedule Resource Policy.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a Compute Engine Snapshot Schedule Resource
    Policy with a daily snapshot taken at 13:00Z and a one day snapshot
    retention policy.

        $ gcloud beta compute resource-policies create snapshot-schedule \
            my-resource-policy --region=REGION --start-time=13:00 \
            --daily-schedule --max-retention-days=1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the resource policy to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --max-retention-days=MAX_RETENTION_DAYS
        Maximum number of days snapshot can be retained.

     Cycle Frequency Group.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       Using a file:

         --weekly-schedule-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
            A JSON/YAML file which specifies a weekly schedule. The file should
            contain the following fields:

            day: Day of the week with the same choices as --weekly-schedule.
            startTime: Start time of the snapshot schedule with the same format
            as --start-time.

            For more information about using a file, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots#create_snapshot_schedule.

            Use a full or relative path to a local file containing the value of
            weekly_schedule.

       Using command flags:

         --start-time=START_TIME
            Start time for the disk snapshot schedule in UTC. For example,
            --start-time="15:00".

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         Exactly one of these must be specified:

           --daily-schedule
              Snapshot schedule starts daily at START_TIME.

           --hourly-schedule=HOURS
              Snapshot schedule occurs every n hours starting at START_TIME.

           --weekly-schedule=WEEKLY_CYCLE
              Snapshot schedule occurs weekly on WEEKLY_SCHEDULE at START_TIME.
              WEEKLY_CYCLE must be one of: monday, tuesday, wednesday,
              thursday, friday, saturday, sunday.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the backend.

     --on-source-disk-delete=ON_SOURCE_DISK_DELETE
        Retention behavior of automatic snapshots in the event of source disk
        deletion. ON_SOURCE_DISK_DELETE must be one of:

         apply-retention-policy
            Continue to apply the retention window to automatically-created
            snapshots when the source disk is deleted.
         keep-auto-snapshots
            Keep automatically-created snapshots when the source disk is
            deleted. This is the default behavior.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the resource policy to operate on. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     Snapshot properties

       --guest-flush
          Create an application consistent snapshot by informing the OS to
          prepare for the snapshot process.

       --snapshot-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

          Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
          (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
          contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
          numbers.

          The label is added to each snapshot created by the schedule.

       --storage-location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud Storage location, either regional or multi-regional,
          where snapshot content is to be stored. If absent, a nearby regional
          or multi-regional location is chosen automatically.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
