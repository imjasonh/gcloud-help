DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances update updates labels and requested
    CPU Platform for a Compute Engine virtual machine.

EXAMPLES
    To modify the instance 'example-instance' in 'us-central1-a' by adding
    labels 'k0', with value 'value1' and label 'k1' with value 'value2' and
    removing labels with key 'k3', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances update example-instance \
            --zone=us-central1-a --update-labels=k0=value1,k1=value2 \
            --remove-labels=k3

    Labels can be used to identify the instance. To list instances with the
    'k1:value2' label, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances list --filter='labels.k1:value2'

    To list only the labels when describing a resource, use --format to filter
    the result:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances describe example-instance \
            --format="default(labels)"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to update. For details on valid instance names,
        refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --[no-]deletion-protection
        Enables deletion protection for the instance. Use --deletion-protection
        to enable and --no-deletion-protection to disable.

     --[no-]enable-display-device
        Enable a display device on VM instances. Use --enable-display-device to
        enable and --no-enable-display-device to disable.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud beta compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        You can find more information on-line:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --[no-]shielded-integrity-monitoring
        Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the
        instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy
        baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly
        trusted boot image when the instance is created. This baseline can be
        updated by using gcloud compute instances update
        --shielded-learn-integrity-policy. On Shielded VM instances, integrity
        monitoring is enabled by default. For information about how to modify
        Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.
        For information about monitoring integrity on Shielded VM instances,
        see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/integrity-monitoring."
        Changes to this setting with the update command only take effect after
        stopping and starting the instance. Use --shielded-integrity-monitoring
        to enable and --no-shielded-integrity-monitoring to disable.

     --shielded-learn-integrity-policy
        Causes the instance to re-learn the integrity policy baseline using the
        current instance configuration. Use this flag after any planned
        boot-specific changes in the instance configuration, like kernel
        updates or kernel driver installation.

     --[no-]shielded-secure-boot
        The instance boots with secure boot enabled. On Shielded VM instances,
        Secure Boot is not enabled by default. For information about how to
        modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.
        Changes to this setting with the update command only take effect after
        stopping and starting the instance. Use --shielded-secure-boot to
        enable and --no-shielded-secure-boot to disable.

     --[no-]shielded-vtpm
        The instance boots with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled. A
        TPM is a hardware module that can be used for different security
        operations such as remote attestation, encryption, and sealing of keys.
        On Shielded VM instances, vTPM is enabled by default. For information
        about how to modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.
        Changes to this setting with the update command only take effect after
        stopping and starting the instance. Use --shielded-vtpm to enable and
        --no-shielded-vtpm to disable.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to update. If not specified, you might be prompted
        to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to identify
        the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your currently
        active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud prompts you
        for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud beta compute instances update --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud beta compute instances update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.

     Sole Tenancy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-node-affinities
          Removes the node affinities field from the instance. If specified,
          the instance node settings will be cleared. The instance will not be
          scheduled onto a sole-tenant node.

       --node=NODE
          The name of the node to schedule this instance on.

       --node-affinity-file=NODE_AFFINITY_FILE
          The JSON/YAML file containing the configuration of desired nodes onto
          which this instance could be scheduled. These rules filter the nodes
          according to their node affinity labels. A node's affinity labels
          come from the node template of the group the node is in.

          The file should contain a list of a JSON/YAML objects. For an
          example, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/provisioning-sole-tenant-vms#configure_node_affinity_labels.
          The following list describes the fields:

           key
              Corresponds to the node affinity label keys of the Node resource.
           operator
              Specifies the node selection type. Must be one of: IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to seek for matched nodes. NOT_IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to avoid certain nodes.
           values
              Optional. A list of values which correspond to the node affinity
              label values of the Node resource.

       --node-group=NODE_GROUP
          The name of the node group to schedule this instance on.
