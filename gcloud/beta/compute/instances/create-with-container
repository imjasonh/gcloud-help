DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances create-with-container creates Compute
    Engine virtual machines that runs a Docker image. For example:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances create-with-container instance-1 \
            --zone us-central1-a             \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox

    creates an instance called instance-1, in the us-central1-a zone, running
    the 'busybox' image.

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To run the gcr.io/google-containers/busybox image on an instance named
    'instance-1' that executes 'echo "Hello world"' as a run command, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances create-with-container instance-1 \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox \
            --container-command='echo "Hello world"'

    To run the gcr.io/google-containers/busybox image in privileged mode, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances create-with-container instance-1 \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox \
            --container-privileged

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to create. For details on valid instance names,
        refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
        Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

         type
            The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
            accelerator to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute
            accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
            types.

         count
            Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default
            value is 1.

     --boot-disk-auto-delete
        Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted.
        Enabled by default, use --no-boot-disk-auto-delete to disable.

     --boot-disk-device-name=BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
        The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This
        option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
        opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

     --boot-disk-provisioned-iops=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_IOPS
        Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the number
        of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value must be
        between 10,000 and 120,000.

     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
        terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. The
        minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a
        multiple of 1 GB. Limit boot disk size to 2 TB to account for MBR
        partition table limitations. Default size unit is GB.

     --boot-disk-type=BOOT_DISK_TYPE
        The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
        compute disk-types list.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
        non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

     --confidential-compute
        The instance boots with Confidential Computing enabled. Confidential
        Computing is based on Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), an AMD
        virtualization feature for running confidential instances.

     --container-arg=CONTAINER_ARG
        Argument to append to container entrypoint or to override container
        CMD. Each argument must have a separate flag. Arguments are appended in
        the order of flags. Example:

        Assuming the default entry point of the container (or an entry point
        overridden with --container-command flag) is a Bourne shell-compatible
        executable, in order to execute 'ls -l' command in the container, the
        user could use:

        --container-arg="-c" --container-arg="ls -l"

        Caveat: due to the nature of the argument parsing, it's impossible to
        provide the flag value that starts with a dash (-) without the = sign
        (that is, --container-arg "-c" will not work correctly).

        Default: None. (no arguments appended)

     --container-command=CONTAINER_COMMAND
        Specifies what executable to run when the container starts (overrides
        default entrypoint), eg. nc.

        Default: None (default container entrypoint is used)

     --container-env=[KEY=VALUE, ...,...]
        Declare environment variables KEY with value VALUE passed to container.
        Only the last value of KEY is taken when KEY is repeated more than
        once.

        Values, declared with --container-env flag override those with the same
        KEY from file, provided in --container-env-file.

     --container-env-file=CONTAINER_ENV_FILE
        Declare environment variables in a file. Values, declared with
        --container-env flag override those with the same KEY from file.

        File with environment variables in format used by docker (almost). This
        means:
        ◆ Lines are in format KEY=VALUE.
        ◆ Values must contain equality signs.
        ◆ Variables without values are not supported (this is different from
          docker format).
        ◆ If # is first non-whitespace character in a line the line is
          ignored as a comment.
        ◆ Lines with nothing but whitespace are ignored.

     --container-image=CONTAINER_IMAGE
        Full container image name, which should be pulled onto VM instance, eg.
        docker.io/tomcat.

     --container-mount-disk=[mode=MODE],[mount-path=MOUNT-PATH],[name=NAME],[partition=PARTITION]
        Mounts a disk to the specified mount path in the container. Multiple '
        flags are allowed. Must be used with --disk or --create-disk.

         name
            Name of the disk. If exactly one additional disk is attached to the
            instance using --disk or --create-disk, specifying disk name here
            is optional. The name of the single additional disk will be used by
            default.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

         partition
            Optional. The partition of the disk to mount. Multiple partitions
            of a disk can be mounted. Can't be used with --create-disk.

         mode
            Volume mount mode: rw (read/write) or ro (read-only). Defaults to
            rw. Fails if the disk mode is ro and volume mount mode is rw.

     --container-mount-host-path=[host-path=HOSTPATH,mount-path=MOUNTPATH[,mode=MODE],...]
        Mounts a volume by using host-path.

         host-path
            Path on host to mount from.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

         mode
            Volume mount mode: rw (read/write) or ro (read-only).

            Default: rw.

     --container-mount-tmpfs=[mount-path=MOUNTPATH,...]
        Mounts empty tmpfs into container at MOUNTPATH.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

     --container-privileged
        Specify whether to run container in privileged mode.

        Default: --no-container-privileged.

     --container-restart-policy=POLICY; default="always"
        Specify whether to restart a container on exit. POLICY must be one of:
        never, on-failure, always.

     --container-stdin
        Keep container STDIN open even if not attached.

        Default: --no-container-stdin.

     --container-tty
        Allocate a pseudo-TTY for the container.

        Default: --no-container-tty.

     --create-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

         name
            Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if
            more than one instance is being created. Must specify this option
            if attaching the disk to a container with --container-mount-disk.

         description
            Optional textual description for the disk being created.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default. It is an error to create a disk in ro mode if attaching it
            to a container with --container-mount-disk.

         image
            Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized
            with. A new disk will be created based on the given image. To view
            a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud compute images
            list. It is best practice to use image when a specific version of
            an image is needed. If both image and image-family flags are
            omitted a blank disk will be created.

         image-family
            The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will
            be initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux
            distributions, some of which are available as both regular and
            Shielded VM images. When a family is specified instead of an image,
            the latest non-deprecated image associated with that family is
            used. It is best practice to use --image-family when the latest
            version of an image is needed.

         image-project
            The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
            references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
            image-project. A full list of available image projects can be
            generated by running gcloud compute images list.

            ▸ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
              provided.
            ▸ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
              projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to
              be used.
            ▸ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided,
              the current default project is used.

         size
            The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
            a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,
            or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte
            disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the
            default image size will be used for the new disk.

         type
            The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $
            gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
            pd-standard.

         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Must be the same as name if used with
            --container-mount-disk. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used. If omitted and used with
            --container-mount-disk (where the name of the container mount disk
            is the same as in this flag), a device name equal to disk name will
            be used.

         provisioned-iops
            Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the
            number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value
            must be between 10,000 and 120,000.

         disk-resource-policy
            Resource policy to apply to the disk. Specify a full or partial
            URL. For example:
            ▸ https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy
            ▸ projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy

            For more information, see the following docs:
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/resource-policies/
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

         multi-writer
            If yes, the disk is created in multi-writer mode so that it can be
            attached with read-write access to two VMs. The default value is
            no. The multi-writer feature requires specialized filesystems,
            among other restrictions. For more information, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/sharing-disks-between-vms.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description of the instances.

     --disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[boot=BOOT],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[name=NAME],[scope=SCOPE]
        Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified must
        already exist.

         name
            The disk to attach to the instances. When creating more than one
            instance and using this property, the only valid mode for attaching
            the disk is read-only (see mode below).

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default. It is an error for mode to be rw when creating more than
            one instance because read-write disks can only be attached to a
            single instance.

         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machines
            will use the first partition of the disk for their root file
            systems. The default value for this is no.

         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Must be the same as name if used with
            --container-mount-disk. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used. If omitted and used with
            --container-mount-disk (where the name of the container mount disk
            is the same as in this flag), a device name equal to disk name will
            be used.

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

         scope
            Can be zonal or regional. If zonal, the disk is interpreted as a
            zonal disk in the same zone as the instance (default). If regional,
            the disk is interpreted as a regional disk in the same region as
            the instance. The default value for this is zonal.

     --[no-]enable-nested-virtualization
        If set to true, enables nested virtualization for the instance. Use
        --enable-nested-virtualization to enable and
        --no-enable-nested-virtualization to disable.

     --host-error-timeout-seconds=HOST_ERROR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
        The timeout in seconds for host error detection. The value must be set
        with 30 second increments, with a range of 90 to 330 seconds. If unset,
        the default behavior of the host error recovery is used.

     --instance-termination-action=INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION
        Specifies the termination action that will be taken upon VM preemption.
        INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION must be one of:

         DELETE
            Permanently delete the VM.
         STOP
            Default. Stop the VM without preserving memory. The VM can be
            restarted later.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --local-ssd=[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[interface=INTERFACE]
        Attaches a local SSD to the instances.

         device-name
            Optional. A name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Can only be specified if interface is SCSI. If
            omitted, a device name of the form local-ssd-N will be used.

         interface
            Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this
            SSD. Valid values are SCSI and NVME. SCSI is the default and is
            supported by more guest operating systems. NVME might provide
            higher performance.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

     --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the VMs when their host machines undergo
        maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. For more information, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/host-maintenance-options.
        MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

         MIGRATE
            The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
            temporarily impact the performance of instances during a migration
            event.
         TERMINATE
            The instances should be terminated.

     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128
        bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for
        all metadata entries is 512 KB.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

        For startup scripts on Windows instances, the following metadata keys
        have special meanings: windows-startup-script-url,
        windows-startup-script-cmd, windows-startup-script-bat,
        windows-startup-script-ps1, sysprep-specialize-script-url,
        sysprep-specialize-script-cmd, sysprep-specialize-script-bat, and
        sysprep-specialize-script-ps1. For more information, see Running
        startup scripts (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript).

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud beta compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        You can find more information on-line:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network that the VM instances are a part of. If --subnet
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by this --network flag. If neither is specified, the default network is
        used.

     --network-interface=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a network interface to the instance. Mutually exclusive with any
        of these flags: --address, --network, --network-tier, --subnet,
        --private-network-ip. This flag can be repeated to specify multiple
        network interfaces.

        The following keys are allowed:
         address
            Assigns the given external address to the instance that is created.
            Specifying an empty string will assign an ephemeral IP. Mutually
            exclusive with no-address. If neither key is present the instance
            will get an ephemeral IP.

         network
            Specifies the network that the interface will be part of. If subnet
            is also specified it must be subnetwork of this network. If neither
            is specified, this defaults to the "default" network.

         no-address
            If specified the interface will have no external IP. Mutually
            exclusive with address. If neither key is present the instance will
            get an ephemeral IP.

         network-tier
            Specifies the network tier of the interface. NETWORK_TIER must be
            one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD, FIXED_STANDARD. The default value is
            PREMIUM.

         private-network-ip
            Assigns the given RFC1918 IP address to the interface.

         subnet
            Specifies the subnet that the interface will be part of. If network
            key is also specified this must be a subnetwork of the specified
            network.

         nic-type
            Specifies the Network Interface Controller (NIC) type for the
            interface. NIC_TYPE must be one of: GVNIC, VIRTIO_NET.

         aliases
            Specifies the IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If
            there are multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by
            semicolons.

            For example:

                --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"

                Each IP alias range consists of a range name and an IP range
                separated by a colon, or just the IP range.
                The range name is the name of the range within the network
                interface's subnet from which to allocate an IP alias range. If
                unspecified, it defaults to the primary IP range of the subnet.
                The IP range can be a CIDR range (e.g. `192.168.100.0/24`), a single
                IP address (e.g. `192.168.100.1`), or a netmask in CIDR format (e.g.
                `/24`). If the IP range is specified by CIDR range or single IP
                address, it must belong to the CIDR range specified by the range
                name on the subnet. If the IP range is specified by netmask, the
                IP allocator will pick an available range with the specified netmask
                and allocate it to this network interface.

     --network-performance-configs=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Configures network performance settings for the instance. If this flag
        is not specified, the instance will be created with its default network
        performance configuration.

         total-egress-bandwidth-tier
            Total egress bandwidth is the available outbound bandwidth from a
            VM, regardless of whether the traffic is going to internal IP or
            external IP destinations. The following tier values are allowed:
            [DEFAULT,TIER_1]

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the instance.
        NETWORK_TIER must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD, FIXED_STANDARD. The
        default value is PREMIUM.

     --preemptible
        If provided, instances will be preemptible and time-limited. Instances
        might be preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and
        will only be able to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible
        instances can not be restarted and will not migrate.

     --private-ipv6-google-access-type=PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE
        The private IPv6 Google access type for the VM.
        PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of:
        enable-bidirectional-access, enable-outbound-vm-access,
        inherit-subnetwork.

     --private-network-ip=PRIVATE_NETWORK_IP
        Specifies the RFC1918 IP to assign to the instance. The IP should be in
        the subnet or legacy network IP range.

     --provisioning-model=PROVISIONING_MODEL
        Specifies provisioning model, which determines price, obtainability,
        and runtime for the VM instance. PROVISIONING_MODEL must be one of:

         SPOT
            Spot VMs are spare capacity; Spot VMs are discounted to have much
            lower prices than standard VMs but have no guaranteed runtime. Spot
            VMs are the new version of preemptible VM instances, except Spot
            VMs do not have a 24-hour maximum runtime.
         STANDARD
            Default. Standard provisioning model for VM instances, which has
            user-controlled runtime but no Spot discounts.

     --restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.
        Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --shielded-integrity-monitoring
        Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the
        instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy
        baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly
        trusted boot image when the instance is created. This baseline can be
        updated by using gcloud compute instances update-container
        --shielded-learn-integrity-policy. On Shielded VM instances, integrity
        monitoring is enabled by default. For information about how to modify
        Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.
        For information about monitoring integrity on Shielded VM instances,
        see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/integrity-monitoring."

     --shielded-secure-boot
        The instance boots with secure boot enabled. On Shielded VM instances,
        Secure Boot is not enabled by default. For information about how to
        modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --shielded-vtpm
        The instance boots with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled. A
        TPM is a hardware module that can be used for different security
        operations such as remote attestation, encryption, and sealing of keys.
        On Shielded VM instances, vTPM is enabled by default. For information
        about how to modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --source-instance-template=SOURCE_INSTANCE_TEMPLATE
        The name of the instance template that the instance will be created
        from.

        Users can also override machine type and labels. Values of other flags
        will be ignored and --source-instance-template will be used instead.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet that the VM instances are a part of. If --network
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by the --network flag.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instance. These tags allow
        network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1) for more
        details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list instances with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list instances tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     --threads-per-core=THREADS_PER_CORE
        The number of visible threads per physical core. To disable
        simultaneous multithreading (SMT) set this to 1. Valid values are: 1 or
        2.

        For more information about configuring SMT, see:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/configuring-simultaneous-multithreading.

     --visible-core-count=VISIBLE_CORE_COUNT
        The number of physical cores to expose to the instance's guest
        operating system. The number of virtual CPUs visible to the instance's
        guest operating system is this number of cores multiplied by the
        instance's count of visible threads per physical core.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to create. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --address=ADDRESS
          Assigns the given external address to the instance that is created.
          The address might be an IP address or the name or URI of an address
          resource. This option can only be used when creating a single
          instance.

       --no-address
          If provided, the instances are not assigned external IP addresses. To
          pull container images, you must configure private Google access if
          using Container Registry or configure Cloud NAT for instances to
          access container images directly. For more information, see:
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/using-nat

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value specifying the number of cores that are needed
          in the custom machine type.

          For some machine types, shared-core values can also be used. For
          example, for E2 machine types, you can specify micro, small, or
          medium.

          This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed.

          This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies VM type. n1 - VMs with CPU platforms Skylake and older, n2
          - VMs with CPU platform Cascade Lake. n2 offers flexible sizing from
          2 to 80 vCPUs, and 1 to 640GBs of memory. It also features a number
          of performance enhancements including exposing a more accurate NUMA
          topology to the guest OS. The default is n1.

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
        references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
        image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated by
        running gcloud projects list.
        ◆ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        ◆ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        ◆ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new
          boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will
          have the same name as the instance. To view a list of public images
          and projects, run $ gcloud compute images list. It is best practice
          to use --image when a specific version of an image is needed.

          When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size
          can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,
          respectively.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be
          initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions,
          some of which are available as both regular and Shielded VM images.
          When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
          non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best
          practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is
          needed.

          By default, debian-11 is assumed for this flag.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --public-ptr
          Creates a DNS PTR record for the external IP of the instance.

       --no-public-ptr
          If provided, no DNS PTR record is created for the external IP of the
          instance. Mutually exclusive with public-ptr-domain.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --public-ptr-domain=PUBLIC_PTR_DOMAIN
          Assigns a custom PTR domain for the external IP of the instance.
          Mutually exclusive with no-public-ptr.

       --no-public-ptr-domain
          If both this flag and --public-ptr are specified, creates a DNS PTR
          record for the external IP of the instance with the PTR domain name
          being the DNS name of the instance.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,
          described below.

          SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. Default
          scopes are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

            Alias                  URI

       --no-scopes
          Create instance without scopes

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          A service account is an identity attached to the instance. Its access
          tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and are
          used to authenticate applications on the instance. The account can be
          set using an email address corresponding to the required service
          account.

          If not provided, the instance will use the project's default service
          account.

       --no-service-account
          Create instance without service account
