NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances move - move an instance and its attached
        persistent disks between zones

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances move INSTANCE_NAME
        --destination-zone=DESTINATION_ZONE [--async] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) (DEPRECATED) This command is deprecated. Please see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/moving-instance-across-zones
    for an alternative method.

    gcloud beta compute instances move moves a Compute Engine virtual machine
    from one zone to another. Moving a virtual machine might incur downtime if
    the guest OS must be shut down in order to quiesce disk volumes prior to
    snapshotting.

    For example, running the following command moves the instance called
    example-instance-1 with its attached persistent disks, currently running in
    us-central1-b, to us-central1-f.

        $ gcloud compute instances move example-instance-1 \
           --zone=us-central1-b --destination-zone=us-central1-f

    Note: Moving VMs or disks by using the gcloud beta compute instances move
    command might cause unexpected behavior. For more information, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/known-issues#moving_vms_or_disks_using_the_moveinstance_api_or_the_causes_unexpected_behavior.

    Please note that gcloud compute instances move does not yet support
    instances which have regional persistent disks attached. Please see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/regional-persistent-disk for
    more details.

EXAMPLES
    To move instance-1 from us-central-a to europe-west1-d, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances move instance-1 \
            --zone=us-central1-a --destination-zone=europe-west1-d

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --destination-zone=DESTINATION_ZONE
        The zone to move the instance to.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances move

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances move
