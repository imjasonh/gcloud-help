NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances simulate-maintenance-event - simulate host
        maintenance of VM instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances simulate-maintenance-event INSTANCE_NAMES
        [INSTANCE_NAMES ...] [--async]
        [--with-extended-notifications=WITH_EXTENDED_NOTIFICATIONS]
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances simulate-maintenance-event simulates a
    host maintenance event on a Compute Engine VM. For more information, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/simulating-host-maintenance.

EXAMPLES
    To simulate a maintenance event on an instance named test-instance located
    in zone us-east1-d, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances simulate-maintenance-event \
            test-instance --zone=us-east1-d

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --with-extended-notifications=WITH_EXTENDED_NOTIFICATIONS
        Send an extended notification before simulating a host maintenance
        event on a Compute Engine VM.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances simulate-maintenance-event

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances simulate-maintenance-event
