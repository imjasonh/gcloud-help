DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances create facilitates the creation of
    Compute Engine virtual machines.

    When an instance is in RUNNING state and the system begins to boot, the
    instance creation is considered finished, and the command returns with a
    list of new virtual machines. Note that you usually cannot log into a new
    instance until it finishes booting. Check the progress of an instance using
    gcloud compute instances get-serial-port-output.

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

EXAMPLES
    To create an instance with the latest 'Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8' image
    available, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances create example-instance \
            --image-family=rhel-8 --image-project=rhel-cloud \
            --zone=us-central1-a

    To create instances called 'example-instance-1', 'example-instance-2', and
    'example-instance-3' in the 'us-central1-a' zone, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances create example-instance-1 \
            example-instance-2 example-instance-3 --zone=us-central1-a

    To create an instance called 'instance-1' from a source snapshot called
    'instance-snapshot' in zone 'us-central1-a' and attached regional disk
    'disk-1', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances create instance-1 \
            --source-snapshot=https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/\
        projects/myproject/global/snapshots/instance-snapshot \
            --zone=us-central1-a --disk=name=disk1,scope=regional

    To create an instance called instance-1 as a Shielded VM instance with
    Secure Boot, virtual trusted platform module (vTPM) enabled and integrity
    monitoring, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances create instance-1 \
            --zone=us-central1-a --shielded-secure-boot --shielded-vtpm \
            --shielded-integrity-monitoring

    To create a preemptible instance called 'instance-1', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances create instance-1 \
            --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --zone=us-central1-b \
            --preemptible --no-restart-on-failure \
            --maintenance-policy=terminate

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to create. For details on valid instance names,
        refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
        Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

         type
            The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
            accelerator to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute
            accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
            types.

         count
            Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default
            value is 1.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --boot-disk-auto-delete
        Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted.
        Enabled by default, use --no-boot-disk-auto-delete to disable.

     --boot-disk-device-name=BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
        The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This
        option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
        opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

     --boot-disk-provisioned-iops=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_IOPS
        Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the number
        of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value must be
        between 10,000 and 120,000.

     --boot-disk-provisioned-throughput=BOOT_DISK_PROVISIONED_THROUGHPUT
        Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk. This sets the
        number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.

     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
        terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. Disk size
        must be a multiple of 1 GB. Default size unit is GB.

     --boot-disk-type=BOOT_DISK_TYPE
        The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
        compute disk-types list.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
        non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

     --create-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

         name
            Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if
            more than one instance is being created.

         description
            Optional textual description for the disk being created.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default.

         image
            Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized
            with. A new disk will be created based on the given image. To view
            a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud compute images
            list. It is best practice to use image when a specific version of
            an image is needed. If both image and image-family flags are
            omitted a blank disk will be created.

         image-family
            The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will
            be initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux
            distributions, some of which are available as both regular and
            Shielded VM images. When a family is specified instead of an image,
            the latest non-deprecated image associated with that family is
            used. It is best practice to use --image-family when the latest
            version of an image is needed.

         image-project
            The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
            references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
            image-project. A full list of available image projects can be
            generated by running gcloud compute images list.

            ▸ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
              provided.
            ▸ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
              projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to
              be used.
            ▸ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided,
              the current default project is used.

         size
            The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
            a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,
            or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte
            disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the
            default image size will be used for the new disk.

         type
            The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $
            gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
            pd-standard.

         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used.

         provisioned-iops
            Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the
            number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value
            must be between 10,000 and 120,000.

         provisioned-throughput
            Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk. This sets
            the number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.

         disk-resource-policy
            Resource policy to apply to the disk. Specify a full or partial
            URL. For example:
            ▸ https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy
            ▸ projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/my-resource-policy

            For more information, see the following docs:
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/resource-policies/
            ▸ https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

         architecture
            Specifies the architecture or processor type that this disk can
            support. For available processor types on Compute Engine, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms.

         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The instance will use
            the first partition of the disk for its root file system. The
            default value for this is no.

         kms-key
            Fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name that will protect the
            disk.

            This can either be the fully qualified path or the name.

            The fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name format is:
            projects/<kms-project>/locations/<kms-location>/keyRings/<kms-keyring>/
            cryptoKeys/<key-name>.

            If the value is not fully qualified then kms-location, kms-keyring,
            and optionally kms-project are required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-project
            Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the
            disk.

            If the project is not specified then the project where the disk is
            being created will be used.

            If this flag is set then key-location, kms-keyring, and kms-key are
            required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-location
            Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the
            disk.

            All Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a list
            of possible locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'. If this flag
            is set then kms-keyring and kms-key are required. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-keyring
            The keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will
            protect the disk.

            If this flag is set then kms-location and kms-key are required.

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         source-snapshot
            The source disk snapshot that will be used to create the disk. You
            can provide this as a full URL to the snapshot or just the snapshot
            name. For example, the following are valid values:

            ▸ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/snapshots/snapshot
            ▸ snapshot

         multi-writer
            If yes, the disk is created in multi-writer mode so that it can be
            attached with read-write access to two VMs. The default value is
            no. The multi-writer feature requires specialized filesystems,
            among other restrictions. For more information, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/sharing-disks-between-vms.

         confidential-compute
            If yes, the disk is created in confidential mode. The default value
            is no. Encryption with a Cloud KMS key is required to enable this
            option.

         replica-zones
            Required for each regional disk associated with the instance.
            Specify the URLs of the zones where the disk should be replicated
            to. You must provide exactly two replica zones, and one zone must
            be the same as the instance zone.

     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file that maps
        Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when creating,
        mounting, or taking snapshots of disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag, the CSEK is read from stdin. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --deletion-protection
        Enables deletion protection for the instance.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description of the instances.

     --disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[boot=BOOT],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[force-attach=FORCE-ATTACH],[mode=MODE],[name=NAME],[scope=SCOPE]
        Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified must
        already exist.

         name
            The disk to attach to the instances. When creating more than one
            instance and using this property, the only valid mode for attaching
            the disk is read-only (see mode below).

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default. It is an error for mode to be rw when creating more than
            one instance because read-write disks can only be attached to a
            single instance.

         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machines
            will use the first partition of the disk for their root file
            systems. The default value for this is no.

         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used.

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

         scope
            Can be zonal or regional. If zonal, the disk is interpreted as a
            zonal disk in the same zone as the instance (default). If regional,
            the disk is interpreted as a regional disk in the same region as
            the instance. The default value for this is zonal.
         force-attach
            If yes, this persistent disk will force-attached to the instance
            even it is already attached to another instance. The default value
            is 'no'.

     --enable-display-device
        Enable a display device on VM instances. Disabled by default.

     --[no-]enable-nested-virtualization
        If set to true, enables nested virtualization for the instance. Use
        --enable-nested-virtualization to enable and
        --no-enable-nested-virtualization to disable.

     --[no-]enable-uefi-networking
        If set to true, enables UEFI networking for the instance creation. Use
        --enable-uefi-networking to enable and --no-enable-uefi-networking to
        disable.

     --erase-windows-vss-signature
        Specifies whether the disk restored from source snapshots or source
        machine image should erase Windows specific VSS signature. See
        https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/disks/snapshot#--guest-flush

     --external-ipv6-address=EXTERNAL_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given external IPv6 address to the instance that is
        created. The address must be the first IP address in the range. This
        option can be used only when creating a single instance.

     --external-ipv6-prefix-length=EXTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        The prefix length of the external IPv6 address range. This field should
        be used together with --external-ipv6-address. Only the /96 IP address
        range is supported, and the default value is 96.

     --host-error-timeout-seconds=HOST_ERROR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
        The timeout in seconds for host error detection. The value must be set
        with 30 second increments, with a range of 90 to 330 seconds. If unset,
        the default behavior of the host error recovery is used.

     --hostname=HOSTNAME
        Specify the hostname of the instance to be created. The specified
        hostname must be RFC1035 compliant. If hostname is not specified, the
        default hostname is [INSTANCE_NAME].c.[PROJECT_ID].internal when using
        the global DNS, and [INSTANCE_NAME].[ZONE].c.[PROJECT_ID].internal when
        using zonal DNS.

     --instance-termination-action=INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION
        Specifies the termination action that will be taken upon VM preemption

     --internal-ipv6-address=INTERNAL_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given internal IPv6 address or range to the instance that
        is created. The address must be the first IP address in the range or
        from a /96 IP address range. This option can be used only when creating
        a single instance.

     --internal-ipv6-prefix-length=INTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        Optional field that indicates the prefix length of the internal IPv6
        address range. It should be used together with --internal-ipv6-address.
        Only /96 IP address range is supported and the default value is 96. If
        not set, either the prefix length from --internal-ipv6-address will be
        used or the default value of 96 will be assigned.

     --ipv6-network-tier=IPV6_NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the IPv6 network tier that will be used to configure the
        instance network interface IPv6 access config. IPV6_NETWORK_TIER must
        be (only one value is supported):

         PREMIUM

        numbers.

     --local-ssd=[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
        Attaches a local SSD to the instances.

         device-name
            Optional. A name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Can only be specified if interface is SCSI. If
            omitted, a device name of the form local-ssd-N will be used.

         interface
            Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this
            SSD. Valid values are SCSI and NVME. SCSI is the default and is
            supported by more guest operating systems. NVME might provide
            higher performance.

         size
            Optional. The only valid value is 375GB. Specify the --local-ssd
            flag multiple times if you need multiple 375GB local SSD
            partitions. You can specify a maximum of 24 local SSDs for a
            maximum of 9TB attached to an instance.

     --local-ssd-recovery-timeout=LOCAL_SSD_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT
        Specifies the maximum amount of time a Local Ssd Vm should wait while
        recovery of the Local Ssd state is attempted. Its value should be in
        between 0 and 168 hours with hour granularity and the default value
        being 1 hour.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

     --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the VMs when their host machines undergo
        maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. For more information, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/host-maintenance-options.
        MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

         MIGRATE
            The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
            temporarily impact the performance of instances during a migration
            event.
         TERMINATE
            The instances should be terminated.

     --max-run-duration=MAX_RUN_DURATION
        Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a duration
        relative to the VM instance's most-recent start time. Format the
        duration, MAX_RUN_DURATION, as the number of days, hours, minutes, and
        seconds followed by d, h, m, and s respectively. For example, specify
        30m for a duration of 30 minutes or specify 1d2h3m4s for a duration of
        1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4 seconds. Alternatively, to specify a
        timestamp, use --termination-time instead.

        If neither --max-run-duration nor --termination-time is specified
        (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or
        system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to
        be automatically terminated using the action specified by
        --instance-termination-action. For --max-run-duration, the VM instance
        is automatically terminated when the VM's current runtime reaches
        MAX_RUN_DURATION. Note: Anytime the VM instance is stopped or
        suspended, --max-run-duration and (unless the VM uses
        --provisioning-model=SPOT) --instance-termination-action are
        automatically removed from the VM.

     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128
        bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for
        all metadata entries is 512 KB.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

            For startup scripts on Windows instances, the following metadata
            keys have special meanings: windows-startup-script-url,
            windows-startup-script-cmd, windows-startup-script-bat,
            windows-startup-script-ps1, sysprep-specialize-script-url,
            sysprep-specialize-script-cmd, sysprep-specialize-script-bat, and
            sysprep-specialize-script-ps1. For more information, see Running
            startup scripts
            (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript).

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud beta compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        You can find more information on-line:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --min-node-cpu=MIN_NODE_CPU
        Minimum number of virtual CPUs this instance will consume when running
        on a sole-tenant node.

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network that the VM instances are a part of. If --subnet
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by this --network flag. If neither is specified, the default network is
        used.

     --network-interface=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a network interface to the instance. Mutually exclusive with any
        of these flags: --address, --network, --network-tier, --subnet,
        --private-network-ip, --stack-type, --ipv6-network-tier,
        --ipv6-public-ptr-domain, --internal-ipv6-address,
        --internal-ipv6-prefix-length, --ipv6-address, --ipv6-prefix-length,
        --external-ipv6-address, --external-ipv6-prefix-length. This flag can
        be repeated to specify multiple network interfaces.

        The following keys are allowed:
         address
            Assigns the given external address to the instance that is created.
            Specifying an empty string will assign an ephemeral IP. Mutually
            exclusive with no-address. If neither key is present the instance
            will get an ephemeral IP.

         network
            Specifies the network that the interface will be part of. If subnet
            is also specified it must be subnetwork of this network. If neither
            is specified, this defaults to the "default" network.

         no-address
            If specified the interface will have no external IP. Mutually
            exclusive with address. If neither key is present the instance will
            get an ephemeral IP.

         network-tier
            Specifies the network tier of the interface. NETWORK_TIER must be
            one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD, FIXED_STANDARD. The default value is
            PREMIUM.

         private-network-ip
            Assigns the given RFC1918 IP address to the interface.

         subnet
            Specifies the subnet that the interface will be part of. If network
            key is also specified this must be a subnetwork of the specified
            network.

         nic-type
            Specifies the Network Interface Controller (NIC) type for the
            interface. NIC_TYPE must be one of: GVNIC, VIRTIO_NET.

         queue-count
            Specifies the networking queue count for this interface. Both Rx
            and Tx queues will be set to this number. If it's not specified, a
            default queue count will be assigned. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/network-bandwidth#rx-tx for
            more details.

         stack-type
            Specifies whether IPv6 is enabled on the interface. STACK_TYPE must
            be one of: IPV4_ONLY, IPV4_IPV6. The default value is IPV4_ONLY.

         ipv6-network-tier
            Specifies the IPv6 network tier that will be used to configure the
            instance network interface IPv6 access config. IPV6_NETWORK_TIER
            must be PREMIUM (currently only one value is supported).

         ipv6-public-ptr-domain
            Assigns a custom PTR domain for the external IPv6 in the IPv6
            access configuration of instance. If its value is not specified,
            the default PTR record will be used. This option can only be
            specified for the default network interface, nic0.

         aliases
            Specifies the IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If
            there are multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by
            semicolons.

            For example:

                --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"

            Each IP alias range consists of a range name and an IP range
            separated by a colon, or just the IP range. The range name is the
            name of the range within the network interface's subnet from which
            to allocate an IP alias range. If unspecified, it defaults to the
            primary IP range of the subnet. The IP range can be a CIDR range
            (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24), a single IP address (e.g. 192.168.100.1),
            or a netmask in CIDR format (e.g. /24). If the IP range is
            specified by CIDR range or single IP address, it must belong to the
            CIDR range specified by the range name on the subnet. If the IP
            range is specified by netmask, the IP allocator will pick an
            available range with the specified netmask and allocate it to this
            network interface.

     --network-performance-configs=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Configures network performance settings for the instance. If this flag
        is not specified, the instance will be created with its default network
        performance configuration.

         total-egress-bandwidth-tier
            Total egress bandwidth is the available outbound bandwidth from a
            VM, regardless of whether the traffic is going to internal IP or
            external IP destinations. The following tier values are allowed:
            [DEFAULT,TIER_1]

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the instance.
        NETWORK_TIER must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD, FIXED_STANDARD. The
        default value is PREMIUM.

         shutdown
            The instance is shut down when the KMS key of one of its attached
            disks is revoked.

     --preemptible
        If provided, instances will be preemptible and time-limited. Instances
        might be preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and
        will only be able to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible
        instances can not be restarted and will not migrate.

     --private-ipv6-google-access-type=PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE
        The private IPv6 Google access type for the VM.
        PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of:
        enable-bidirectional-access, enable-outbound-vm-access,
        inherit-subnetwork.

     --private-network-ip=PRIVATE_NETWORK_IP
        Specifies the RFC1918 IP to assign to the instance. The IP should be in
        the subnet or legacy network IP range.

     --provisioning-model=PROVISIONING_MODEL
        Specifies provisioning model, which determines price, obtainability,
        and runtime for the VM instance. PROVISIONING_MODEL must be one of:

         SPOT
            Spot VMs are spare capacity; Spot VMs are discounted to have much
            lower prices than standard VMs but have no guaranteed runtime. Spot
            VMs are the new version of preemptible VM instances, except Spot
            VMs do not have a 24-hour maximum runtime.
         STANDARD
            Default. Standard provisioning model for VM instances, which has
            user-controlled runtime but no Spot discounts.

     --require-csek-key-create
        Refuse to create resources not protected by a user managed key in the
        key file when --csek-key-file is given. This behavior is enabled by
        default to prevent incorrect gcloud invocations from accidentally
        creating resources with no user managed key. Disabling the check allows
        creation of some resources without a matching Customer-Supplied
        Encryption Key in the supplied --csek-key-file. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details. Enabled by default, use --no-require-csek-key-create
        to disable.

        policies must exist in the same region as the instance.

     --restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.
        Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --shielded-integrity-monitoring
        Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the
        instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy
        baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly
        trusted boot image when the instance is created. This baseline can be
        updated by using gcloud compute instances update
        --shielded-learn-integrity-policy. On Shielded VM instances, integrity
        monitoring is enabled by default. For information about how to modify
        Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.
        For information about monitoring integrity on Shielded VM instances,
        see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/integrity-monitoring."

     --shielded-secure-boot
        The instance boots with secure boot enabled. On Shielded VM instances,
        Secure Boot is not enabled by default. For information about how to
        modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --shielded-vtpm
        The instance boots with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled. A
        TPM is a hardware module that can be used for different security
        operations such as remote attestation, encryption, and sealing of keys.
        On Shielded VM instances, vTPM is enabled by default. For information
        about how to modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --source-instance-template=SOURCE_INSTANCE_TEMPLATE
        The name of the instance template that the instance will be created
        from. An instance template can be a global/regional resource.

        Users can also override machine type and labels. Values of other flags
        will be ignored and --source-instance-template will be used instead.

     --source-machine-image=SOURCE_MACHINE_IMAGE
        The name of the machine image that the instance will be created from.

     --source-machine-image-csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping
        resources to user managed keys which were used to encrypt the source
        machine-image. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

         IPV4_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv4 addresses

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet that the VM instances are a part of. If --network
        is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified
        by the --network flag.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instance. These tags allow
        network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1) for more
        details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list instances with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list instances tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     --termination-time=TERMINATION_TIME
        Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a time. Format
        the time, TERMINATION_TIME, as a RFC 3339 timestamp. For more
        information, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339. Alternatively, to
        specify a duration, use --max-run-duration instead.

        If neither --termination-time nor --max-run-duration is specified
        (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or
        system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to
        be automatically terminated using the action specified by
        --instance-termination-action. For --termination-time, the VM instance
        is automatically terminated at the specified timestamp. Note: Anytime
        the VM instance is stopped or suspended, --termination-time and (unless
        the VM uses --provisioning-model=SPOT) --instance-termination-action
        are automatically removed from the VM.

     --threads-per-core=THREADS_PER_CORE
        The number of visible threads per physical core. To disable
        simultaneous multithreading (SMT) set this to 1. Valid values are: 1 or
        2.

        For more information about configuring SMT, see:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/configuring-simultaneous-multithreading.

     --visible-core-count=VISIBLE_CORE_COUNT
        The number of physical cores to expose to the instance's guest
        operating system. The number of virtual CPUs visible to the instance's
        guest operating system is this number of cores multiplied by the
        instance's count of visible threads per physical core.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to create. If not specified and the compute/zone
        property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive
        mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --address=ADDRESS
          Assigns the given external address to the instance that is created.
          The address might be an IP address or the name or URI of an address
          resource. This option can only be used when creating a single
          instance.

       --no-address
          If provided, the instances are not assigned external IP addresses. To
          pull container images, you must configure private Google access if
          using Container Registry or configure Cloud NAT for instances to
          access container images directly. For more information, see:
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access
          ▸ https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/using-nat

     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the disk. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource.

       --boot-disk-kms-key=BOOT_DISK_KMS_KEY
          ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key.

          To set the kms-key attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-key on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --boot-disk-kms-keyring=BOOT_DISK_KMS_KEYRING
          The KMS keyring of the key.

          To set the kms-keyring attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-keyring on the command line.

            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --boot-disk-kms-project on the command line;
          ▸ set the property core/project.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --confidential-compute
          (DEPRECATED) The instance boots with Confidential Computing enabled.
          Confidential Computing is based on Secure Encrypted Virtualization
          (SEV), an AMD virtualization feature for running confidential
          instances.

          The --confidential-compute flag will soon be deprecated. Please use
          --confidential-compute-type=SEV instead

       --confidential-compute-type=CONFIDENTIAL_COMPUTE_TYPE
          The instance boots with Confidential Computing enabled. Confidential
          Computing can be based on Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) or
          Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP),
          both of which are AMD virtualization features for running
          confidential instances. Trust Domain eXtension based on Intel
          virtualization features for running confidential instances is also
          supported. CONFIDENTIAL_COMPUTE_TYPE must be one of:

           SEV
              Secure Encrypted Virtualization
           SEV_SNP
              Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging
           TDX
              Trust Domain eXtension

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value specifying the number of cores that are needed
          in the custom machine type.

          For some machine types, shared-core values can also be used. For
          example, for E2 machine types, you can specify micro, small, or
          medium.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies a custom machine type. The default is n1. For more
          information about custom machine types, see:
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#custom_machine_types

     --image-family-scope=IMAGE_FAMILY_SCOPE
        Sets the scope for the --image-family flag. By default, when specifying
        an image family in a public image project, the zonal image family scope
        is used. All other projects default to the global image. Use this flag
        to override this behavior. IMAGE_FAMILY_SCOPE must be one of: zonal,
        global.

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
        references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
        image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated by
        running gcloud projects list.
        ◆ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        ◆ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        ◆ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new
          boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will
          have the same name as the instance. To view a list of public images
          and projects, run $ gcloud compute images list. It is best practice
          to use --image when a specific version of an image is needed.

          When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size
          can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,
          respectively.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be
          initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions,
          some of which are available as both regular and Shielded VM images.
          When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
          non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best
          practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is
          needed.

          By default, debian-11 is assumed for this flag.

       --source-snapshot=SOURCE_SNAPSHOT
          The name of the source disk snapshot that the instance boot disk will
          be created from. You can provide this as a full URL to the snapshot
          or just the snapshot name. For example, the following are valid
          values:

          ▸ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/snapshots/snapshot
          ▸ snapshot

     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the instance. The arguments in this group can be used
     to specify the attributes of this resource.

       --instance-kms-key=INSTANCE_KMS_KEY
          ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key.

          To set the kms-key attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --instance-kms-keyring=INSTANCE_KMS_KEYRING
          The KMS keyring of the key.

          To set the kms-keyring attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-keyring on the command line.

       --instance-kms-location=INSTANCE_KMS_LOCATION
          The Cloud location for the key.

          To set the kms-location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-location on the command line.

       --instance-kms-project=INSTANCE_KMS_PROJECT
          The Cloud project for the key.

          To set the kms-project attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-project on the command line;
          ▸ set the property core/project.

     Sole Tenancy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --node=NODE
          The name of the node to schedule this instance on.

       --node-affinity-file=NODE_AFFINITY_FILE
          The JSON/YAML file containing the configuration of desired nodes onto
          which this instance could be scheduled. These rules filter the nodes
          according to their node affinity labels. A node's affinity labels
          come from the node template of the group the node is in.

          The file should contain a list of a JSON/YAML objects. For an
          example, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/provisioning-sole-tenant-vms#configure_node_affinity_labels.
          The following list describes the fields:

           key
              Corresponds to the node affinity label keys of the Node resource.
           operator
              Specifies the node selection type. Must be one of: IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to seek for matched nodes. NOT_IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to avoid certain nodes.
           values
              Optional. A list of values which correspond to the node affinity
              label values of the Node resource.

       --node-group=NODE_GROUP
          The name of the node group to schedule this instance on.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --public-ptr
          Creates a DNS PTR record for the external IP of the instance.

       --no-public-ptr
          If provided, no DNS PTR record is created for the external IP of the
          instance. Mutually exclusive with public-ptr-domain.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --public-ptr-domain=PUBLIC_PTR_DOMAIN
          Assigns a custom PTR domain for the external IP of the instance.
          Mutually exclusive with no-public-ptr.

       --no-public-ptr-domain
          If both this flag and --public-ptr are specified, creates a DNS PTR
          record for the external IP of the instance with the PTR domain name
          being the DNS name of the instance.

     Specifies the reservation for the instance.

       --reservation=RESERVATION
          The name of the reservation, required when --reservation-affinity is
          one of: specific, specific-then-any-reservation or
          specific-then-no-reservation.

       --reservation-affinity=RESERVATION_AFFINITY; default="any"
          The type of reservation for the instance. RESERVATION_AFFINITY must
          be one of:

           any
              Consume any available, matching reservation.
           none
              Do not consume from any reserved capacity.
           specific
              Must consume from a specific reservation.
           specific-then-any-reservation
              Prefer to consume from a specific reservation, but still consume
              any available matching reservation if the specified reservation
              is not available or exhausted.
           specific-then-no-reservation
              Prefer to consume from a specific reservation, but still consume
              from the on-demand pool if the specified reservation is not
              available or exhausted.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,
          described below. However, if neither --scopes nor --no-scopes are
          specified and the project has no default service account, then the
          instance will be created with no scopes. Note that the level of
          access that a service account has is determined by a combination of
          access scopes and IAM roles so you must configure both access scopes
          and IAM roles for the service account to work properly.

          SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. Default
          scopes are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

       --no-scopes
          Create instance without scopes

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          A service account is an identity attached to the instance. Its access
          tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and are
          used to authenticate applications on the instance. The account can be
          set using an email address corresponding to the required service
          account.

          If not provided, the instance will use the project's default service
          account.

       --no-service-account
          Create instance without service account
