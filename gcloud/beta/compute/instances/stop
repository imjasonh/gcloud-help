NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances stop - stop a virtual machine instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances stop INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        [--async] [--discard-local-ssd[=DISCARD_LOCAL_SSD]] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances stop is used to stop a Compute Engine
    virtual machine. Stopping a VM performs a clean shutdown, much like
    invoking the shutdown functionality of a workstation or laptop.

    If a VM has any attached Local SSD disks, you must use the
    --discard-local-ssd flag to indicate whether or not the Local SSD data
    should be discarded. To stop the VM and preserve the Local SSD data when
    you stop the VM by setting --discard-local-ssd=False.

    To stop the VM and discard the Local SSD data, specify
    --discard-local-ssd=True.

    Preserving the Local SSD disk data incurs costs and is subject to
    limitations. See
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#stop_instance for
    more information.

    Stopping a VM which is already stopped will return without errors.

EXAMPLES
    To stop an instance named test-instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances stop test-instance

    To stop an instance named test-instance that has a Local SSD, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances stop test-instance \
            --discard-local-ssd=True

    Using '--discard-local-ssd' without a value defaults to True.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --discard-local-ssd[=DISCARD_LOCAL_SSD]
        If set to true, local SSD data is discarded.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances stop

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances stop
