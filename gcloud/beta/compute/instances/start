NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances start - start a stopped virtual machine
        instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances start INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        [--async] [--csek-key-file=FILE] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances start is used to start a stopped
    Compute Engine virtual machine. Only a stopped virtual machine can be
    started.

EXAMPLES
    To start a stopped instance named 'example-instance' in zone us-central1-a,
    run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances start example-instance \
            --zone=us-central1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file that maps
        Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when creating,
        mounting, or taking snapshots of disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag, the CSEK is read from stdin. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances start

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances start
