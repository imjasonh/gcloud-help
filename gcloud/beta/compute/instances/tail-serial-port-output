NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances tail-serial-port-output - periodically fetch
        new output from a virtual machine instance's serial port and display it
        as it becomes available

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances tail-serial-port-output INSTANCE_NAME
        [--port=PORT] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances tail-serial-port-output is used to
    tail the output from a Compute Engine virtual machine instance's serial
    port. The serial port output from the instance will be printed to standard
    output. This information can be useful for diagnostic purposes.

EXAMPLES
    To fetch new output from instance's serial port and display it, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances tail-serial-port-output \
            example-instance --zone=us-central1-b

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --port=PORT
        Instances can support up to four serial port outputs, numbered 1
        through 4. By default, this command will return the output of the first
        serial port. Setting this flag will return the output of the requested
        serial port.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances tail-serial-port-output

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances tail-serial-port-output
