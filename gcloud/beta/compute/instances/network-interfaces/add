DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances network-interfaces add adds a dynamic
    network interface to a Compute Engine instance. For example:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances network-interfaces add \
            instance-name --parent-nic-name nic1 --vlan 2
        --network network-1 --subnetwork subnetwork-1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --aliases=ALIASES
        The IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If there are
        multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by semicolons.

        For example:

            --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"

        Each IP alias range consists of a range name and an IP range separated
        by a colon, or just the IP range. The range name is the name of the
        range within the network interface's subnet from which to allocate an
        IP alias range. If unspecified, it defaults to the primary IP range of
        the subnet. The IP range can be a CIDR range (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24), a
        single IP address (e.g. 192.168.100.1), or a netmask in CIDR format
        (e.g. /24). If the IP range is specified by CIDR range or single IP
        address, it must belong to the CIDR range specified by the range name
        on the subnet. If the IP range is specified by netmask, the IP
        allocator will pick an available range with the specified netmask and
        allocate it to this network interface.

     --external-ipv6-address=EXTERNAL_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given external IPv6 address to an instance. The address
        must be the first IP in the range. This option is applicable only to
        dual-stack instances with stack-type=IPV4_ONLY.

     --external-ipv6-prefix-length=EXTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        The prefix length of the external IPv6 address range. This flag should
        be used together with --external-ipv6-address. Currently only /96 is
        supported and the default value is 96.

     --internal-ipv6-address=INTERNAL_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Assigns the given internal IPv6 address or range to an instance. The
        address must be the first IP address in the range or a /96 IP address
        range. This option can only be used on a dual stack instance network
        interface.

     --internal-ipv6-prefix-length=INTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX_LENGTH
        Optional field that indicates the prefix length of the internal IPv6
        address range, should be used together with
        --internal-ipv6-address=fd20::. Only /96 IP address range is supported
        and the default value is 96. If not set, then either the prefix length
        from --internal-ipv6-address=fd20::/96 will be used or the default
        value of 96 will be assigned.

     --ipv6-network-tier=IPV6_NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the IPv6 network tier that will be used to configure the
        instance network interface IPv6 access config. IPV6_NETWORK_TIER must
        be (only one value is supported):

         PREMIUM
            High quality, Google-grade network tier.

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network this network interface belongs to.

     --network-attachment=NETWORK_ATTACHMENT
        The network attachment URL this network interface should connect to.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the instance
        network interface. NETWORK_TIER must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD,
        FIXED_STANDARD. The default value is PREMIUM. NETWORK_TIER must be one
        of:

         FIXED_STANDARD
            Public internet quality with fixed bandwidth.
         PREMIUM
            High quality, Google-grade network tier.
         STANDARD
            Public internet quality.

     --parent-nic-name=PARENT_NIC_NAME
        Name of the parent network interface of a dynamic network interface.

     --private-network-ip=PRIVATE_NETWORK_IP
        Specifies the RFC1918 IP to assign to the network interface. The IP
        should be in the subnet IP range.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        The stack type for the default network interface. Determines if IPv6 is
        enabled on the default network interface. STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            The network interface can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
         IPV4_ONLY
            The network interface will be assigned IPv4 addresses.

     --subnetwork=SUBNETWORK
        Specifies the subnetwork this network interface belongs to.

     --vlan=VLAN
        VLAN tag of a dynamic network interface, must be in range from 2 to
        4094 inclusively.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --address=ADDRESS
          Assigns the given external address to the network interface. The
          address might be an IP address or the name or URI of an address
          resource. Specifying an empty string will assign an ephemeral IP.
          Mutually exclusive with no-address. If neither key is present the
          network interface will get an ephemeral IP.

       --no-address
          If specified the network interface will have no external IP. Mutually
          exclusive with address. If neither key is present the network
          interfaces will get an ephemeral IP.
