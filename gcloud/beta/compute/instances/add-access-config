        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances add-access-config is used to create
    access configurations for network interfaces of Compute Engine virtual
    machines. This allows you to assign a public, external IP to a virtual
    machine.

EXAMPLES
    To assign an public, externally accessible IP to a virtual machine named
    example-instance in zone us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances add-access-config example-instance \
            --zone=us-central1-a

    To assign the specific, reserved public IP address 123.456.789.123 to the
    virtual machine, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances add-access-config example-instance \
            --zone=us-central1-a --address=123.456.789.123

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --access-config-name=ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"
        Specifies the name of the new access configuration. external-nat is
        used as the default if this flag is not provided. Since ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
        is currently the only access-config type, it is not recommended that
        you change this value.

     --address=ADDRESS
        Specifies the external IP address of the new access configuration. If
        this is not specified, then the service will choose an available
        ephemeral IP address. If an explicit IP address is given, then that IP
        address must be reserved by the project and not be in use by another
        resource.

     --network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"
        Specifies the name of the network interface which contains the access
        configuration. If this is not provided, then "nic0" is used as the
        default.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier of the access configuration. NETWORK_TIER
        must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD, FIXED_STANDARD. The default value is
        PREMIUM.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --public-ptr
          Creates a DNS PTR record for the external IP in the access
          configuration. This option can only be specified for the default
          network-interface, "nic0".

       --no-public-ptr
          If provided, no DNS PTR record is created for the external IP in the
          access configuration. Mutually exclusive with public-ptr-domain.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --public-ptr-domain=PUBLIC_PTR_DOMAIN
          Assigns a custom PTR domain for the external IP in the access
          configuration. Mutually exclusive with no-public-ptr. This option can
          only be specified for the default network-interface, "nic0".

       --no-public-ptr-domain
          If both this flag and --public-ptr are specified, creates a DNS PTR
          record for the external IP in the access configuration with the PTR
          domain name being the DNS name of the instance.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
