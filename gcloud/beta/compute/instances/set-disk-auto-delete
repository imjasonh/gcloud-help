NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances set-disk-auto-delete - set auto-delete
        behavior for disks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances set-disk-auto-delete INSTANCE_NAME
        (--device-name=DEVICE_NAME | --disk=DISK) [--no-auto-delete]
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) $gcloud beta compute instances set-disk-auto-delete is used to
    configure the auto-delete behavior for disks attached to Compute Engine
    virtual machines. When auto-delete is on, the persistent disk is deleted
    when the instance it is attached to is deleted.

EXAMPLES
    To enable auto-delete for a disk named 'my-disk' on an instance named
    'my-instance', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances set-disk-auto-delete my-instance \
            --auto-delete --disk=my-disk

    To enable auto-delete for a device named 'my-device' on an instance named
    'my-instance', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances set-disk-auto-delete my-instance \
            --auto-delete --device-name=my-device

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --device-name=DEVICE_NAME
          Specifies a disk to set auto-delete for by its device name, which is
          the name that the guest operating system sees. The device name is set
          at the time that the disk is attached to the instance, and need not
          be the same as the persistent disk name. If the disk's device name is
          specified, then its persistent disk name must not be specified using
          the --disk flag.

       --disk=DISK
          Specifies a disk to set auto-delete for by its resource name. If you
          specify a disk to set auto-delete for by persistent disk name, then
          you must not specify its device name using the --device-name flag.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --auto-delete
        Enables auto-delete for the given disk. Enabled by default, use
        --no-auto-delete to disable.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances set-disk-auto-delete

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances set-disk-auto-delete
