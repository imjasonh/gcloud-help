NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances delete-access-config - delete an access
        configuration from a virtual machine network interface

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances delete-access-config INSTANCE_NAME
        [--access-config-name=ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"]
        [--network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances delete-access-config is used to delete
    access configurations from network interfaces of Compute Engine virtual
    machines. Access configurations let you assign a public, external IP to a
    virtual machine.

EXAMPLES
    To remove the externally accessible IP from a virtual machine named
    example-instance in zone us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances delete-access-config \
            example-instance --zone=us-central1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --access-config-name=ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"
        Specifies the name of the access configuration to delete. external-nat
        is used as the default if this flag is not provided.

     --network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"
        Specifies the name of the network interface from which to delete the
        access configuration. If this is not provided, then nic0 is used as the
        default.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
