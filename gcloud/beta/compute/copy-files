NAME
    gcloud beta compute copy-files - copy files to and from Google Compute
        Engine virtual machines via scp

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute copy-files [[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC
        [[[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC ...] [[USER@]INSTANCE:]DEST [--dry-run]
        [--force-key-file-overwrite] [--plain] [--ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE]
        [--strict-host-key-checking=STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING] [--zone=ZONE]
        [--ssh-key-expiration=SSH_KEY_EXPIRATION
          | --ssh-key-expire-after=SSH_KEY_EXPIRE_AFTER] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute copy-files copies files between a virtual
    machine instance and your local machine using the scp command. This command
    does not work for Windows VMs.

    To denote a remote file, prefix the file name with the virtual machine
    instance name (e.g., example-instance:~/FILE). To denote a local file, do
    not add a prefix to the file name (e.g., ~/FILE).

    If a file contains a colon (``:''), you must specify it by either using an
    absolute path or a path that begins with ``./''.

    Under the covers, scp(1) or pscp (on Windows) is used to facilitate the
    transfer.

    When the destination is local, all sources must be the same virtual machine
    instance. When the destination is remote, all sources must be local.

EXAMPLES
    To copy a remote directory '~/REMOTE-DIR' on the instance of
    'example-instance' to '~/LOCAL-DIR' on the local host, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute copy-files example-instance:~/REMOTE-DIR \
            ~/LOCAL-DIR --zone=us-central1-a

    To copy files from your local host to a virtual machine, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute copy-files ~/LOCAL-FILE-1 ~/LOCAL-FILE-2 \
            example-instance:~/REMOTE-DIR --zone=us-central1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC [[[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC ...]
        Specifies the files to copy.

     [[USER@]INSTANCE:]DEST
        Specifies a destination for the source files.

FLAGS
     --dry-run
        Print the equivalent scp/ssh command that would be run to stdout,
        instead of executing it.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled, the gcloud command-line tool will regenerate and overwrite
        the files associated with a broken SSH key without asking for
        confirmation in both interactive and non-interactive environments.

        If disabled, the files associated with a broken SSH key will not be
        regenerated and will fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environments.

     --plain
        Suppress the automatic addition of ssh(1)/scp(1) flags. This flag is
        useful if you want to take care of authentication yourself or use
        specific ssh/scp features.

     --ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

     --strict-host-key-checking=STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING
        Override the default behavior of StrictHostKeyChecking for the
        connection. By default, StrictHostKeyChecking is set to 'no' the first
        time you connect to an instance, and will be set to 'yes' for all
        subsequent connections. STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING must be one of: yes,
        no, ask.

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance to copy files to/from.

        If not specified and the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --ssh-key-expiration=SSH_KEY_EXPIRATION
          The time when the ssh key will be valid until, such as
          "2017-08-29T18:52:51.142Z." This is only valid if the instance is not
          using OS Login. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
          formats.

       --ssh-key-expire-after=SSH_KEY_EXPIRE_AFTER
          The maximum length of time an SSH key is valid for once created and
          installed, e.g. 2m for 2 minutes. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on duration formats.
