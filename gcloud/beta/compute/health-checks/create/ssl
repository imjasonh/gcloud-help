DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute health-checks create ssl is used to create a
    non-legacy health check using the SSL protocol. You can use this health
    check for Google Cloud load balancers or for managed instance group
    autohealing. For more information, see the health checks overview at:
    https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-check-concepts

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the SSL health check to create.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value
        is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional string description for the SSL health check.

     --enable-logging
        Enable logging of health check probe results to Stackdriver. Logging is
        disabled by default.

        Use --no-enable-logging to disable logging.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER; default="NONE"
        The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend.
        PROXY_HEADER must be one of:

         NONE
            No proxy header is added.
         PROXY_V1
            Adds the header "PROXY UNKNOWN\r\n".

     --request=REQUEST
        An optional string of up to 1024 characters to send once the health
        check TCP connection has been established. The health checker then
        looks for a reply of the string provided in the --response field.

        If --response is not configured, the health checker does not wait for a
        response and regards the probe as successful if the TCP or SSL
        handshake was successful.

     --response=RESPONSE
        An optional string of up to 1024 characters that the health checker
        expects to receive from the instance. If the response is not received
        exactly, the health check probe fails. If --response is configured, but
        not --request, the health checker will wait for a response anyway.
        Unless your system automatically sends out a message in response to a
        successful handshake, only configure --response to match an explicit
        --request.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. The default value is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the SSL health check is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the SSL health check to create. If not specified, you might
          be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     These flags configure the port that the health check monitors. If none is
     specified, the default port of 80 is used. If both --port and --port-name
     are specified, --port takes precedence.

       --port=PORT; default=80
          The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

       --port-name=PORT_NAME
          The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
          empty.

       --use-serving-port
          If given, use the "serving port" for health checks:

          ▸ When health checking network endpoints in a Network Endpoint
            Group, use the port specified with each endpoint.
            --use-serving-port must be used when using a Network Endpoint Group
            as a backend as this flag specifies the portSpecification option
            for a Health Check object.
          ▸ When health checking other backends, use the port or named port
            of the backend service.
