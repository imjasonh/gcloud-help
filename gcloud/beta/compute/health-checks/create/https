DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute health-checks create https is used to create a
    non-legacy health check using the HTTPS protocol. You can use this health
    check for Google Cloud load balancers or for managed instance group
    autohealing. For more information, see the health checks overview at:
    https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-check-concepts

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the HTTPS health check to create.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value
        is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional string description for the HTTPS health check.

     --enable-logging
        Enable logging of health check probe results to Stackdriver. Logging is
        disabled by default.

        Use --no-enable-logging to disable logging.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

     --host=HOST
        The value of the host header used for the health check. If unspecified,
        Google Cloud sets the host header to the IP address of the load
        balancer's forwarding rule.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER; default="NONE"
        The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend.
        PROXY_HEADER must be one of:

         NONE
            No proxy header is added.
         PROXY_V1
            Adds the header "PROXY UNKNOWN\r\n".

     --request-path=REQUEST_PATH; default="/"
        The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
        /healthcheck. The default value is ``/''.

     --response=RESPONSE
        When empty, status code of the response determines health. When not
        empty, presence of specified string in first 1024 characters of
        response body determines health. Only ASCII characters allowed.

     --source-regions=REGION,...,[...]
        Define the list of Google Cloud regions from which health checks are
        performed. This option is supported only for global health checks that
        will be referenced by DNS routing policies. If specified, the
        --check-interval field should be at least 30 seconds. The
        --proxy-header and --request fields (for TCP health checks) are not
        supported with this option.

        If --source-regions is specified for a health check, then that health
        check cannot be used by a backend service or by a managed instance
        group (for autohealing).

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. The default value is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the HTTPS health check is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the HTTPS health check to create. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     These flags configure the port that the health check monitors. If none is
     specified, the default port of 80 is used. If both --port and --port-name
     are specified, --port takes precedence.

     --port=PORT; default=80
        The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

     --port-name=PORT_NAME
        The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
        empty.

     --use-serving-port
        If given, use the "serving port" for health checks:

        ◆ When health checking network endpoints in a Network Endpoint Group,
          use the port specified with each endpoint. --use-serving-port must be
          used when using a Network Endpoint Group as a backend as this flag
          specifies the portSpecification option for a Health Check object.
        ◆ When health checking other backends, use the port or named port of
          the backend service.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
