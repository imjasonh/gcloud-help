NAME
    gcloud beta compute addresses create - reserve IP addresses

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute addresses create [NAME ...] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--endpoint-type=ENDPOINT_TYPE] [--network=NETWORK]
        [--network-tier=NETWORK_TIER] [--prefix-length=PREFIX_LENGTH]
        [--purpose=PURPOSE] [--subnet=SUBNET]
        [--addresses=ADDRESS,[ADDRESS,...] | --ip-version=IP_VERSION]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute addresses create is used to reserve one or more
    IP addresses. Once an IP address is reserved, it will be associated with
    the project until it is released using 'gcloud compute addresses delete'.
    Ephemeral IP addresses that are in use by resources in the project can be
    reserved using the '--addresses' flag.

EXAMPLES
    To reserve three IP addresses in the 'us-central1' region, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute addresses create address-1 address-2 \
            address-3 --region=us-central1

    To reserve ephemeral IP addresses '162.222.181.198' and '23.251.146.189'
    which are being used by virtual machine instances in the 'us-central1'
    region, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute addresses create \
            --addresses=162.222.181.198,23.251.146.189 --region=us-central1

    In the above invocation, the two addresses will be assigned random names.

    To reserve an IP address named subnet-address-1 from the subnet 'default'
    in the 'us-central1' region, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute addresses create subnet-address-1 \
            --region=us-central1 --subnet=default

    To reserve an IP address that can be used by multiple internal load
    balancers from the subnet 'default' in the 'us-central1' region, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute addresses create shared-address-1 \
            --region=us-central1 --subnet=default \
            --purpose=SHARED_LOADBALANCER_VIP

    To reserve an IP range '10.110.0.0/16' from the network 'default' for
    'VPC_PEERING', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute addresses create ip-range-1 --global \
            --addresses=10.110.0.0 --prefix-length=16 \
            --purpose=VPC_PEERING --network=default

    To reserve any IP range with prefix length '16' from the network 'default'
    for 'VPC_PEERING', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute addresses create ip-range-1 --global \
            --prefix-length=16 --purpose=VPC_PEERING --network=default

    To reserve an address from network 'default' for PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT,
    run:

        $ gcloud beta compute addresses create psc-address-1 --global \
            --addresses=10.110.0.10 --purpose=PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT \
            --network=default

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [NAME ...]
        Names of the addresses to create.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional textual description for the addresses.

     --endpoint-type=ENDPOINT_TYPE
        The endpoint type of the external IPv6 address to be reserved.
        ENDPOINT_TYPE must be one of: VM, NETLB.

     --network=NETWORK
        If specified, the network resource in which the address(es) should be
        reserved.

        This is only available for global internal address, which represents an
        internal IP range reservation from within the network.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        The network tier to assign to the reserved IP addresses. NETWORK_TIER
        must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is PREMIUM.

        While regional external addresses (--region specified, --subnet
        omitted) can use either PREMIUM or STANDARD, global external addresses
        (--global specified, --subnet omitted) can only use PREMIUM. Internal
        addresses can only use PREMIUM.

     --prefix-length=PREFIX_LENGTH
        The prefix length of the IP range. If the address is an IPv4 address,
        it must be a value between 8 and 30 inclusive. If the address is an
        IPv6 address, the only allowed value is 96. If not present, it means
        the address field is a single IP address.

        This field is not applicable to external IPv4 addresses or global IPv6
        addresses.

     --purpose=PURPOSE
        The purpose of the address resource. This field is not applicable to
        external addresses. PURPOSE must be one of: VPC_PEERING,
        SHARED_LOADBALANCER_VIP, GCE_ENDPOINT, IPSEC_INTERCONNECT,
        PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        If specified, the subnet name in which the address(es) should be
        reserved. The subnet must be in the same region as the address.

        The address will represent an internal IP reservation from within the
        subnet. If --address is specified, it must be within the subnet's IP
        range.

        May not be specified with --global.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --addresses=ADDRESS,[ADDRESS,...]
          Ephemeral IP addresses to promote to reserved status. Only addresses
          that are being used by resources in the project can be promoted. When
          providing this flag, a parallel list of names for the addresses can
          be provided. For example,

              $ gcloud beta compute addresses create ADDRESS-1 ADDRESS-2         \
                    --addresses 162.222.181.197,162.222.181.198             \
                --region us-central1

          will result in 162.222.181.197 being reserved as 'ADDRESS-1' and
          162.222.181.198 as 'ADDRESS-2'. If no names are given,
          server-generated names will be assigned to the IP addresses.

       --ip-version=IP_VERSION
          Version of the IP address to be allocated and reserved. The default
          is IPV4.

          IP version can only be specified for global addresses that are
          generated automatically (i.e., along with the --global flag, given
          --addresses is not specified) and if the --network-tier is PREMIUM.

          IP_VERSION must be one of: IPV4, IPV6.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the addresses are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the addresses to create. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.
