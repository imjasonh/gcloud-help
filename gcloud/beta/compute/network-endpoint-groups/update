DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update a Compute Engine network endpoint group.

EXAMPLES
    To add two endpoints to a network endpoint group:

        $ gcloud beta compute network-endpoint-groups update my-neg \
            --zone=us-central1-a \
            --add-endpoint=instance=my-instance1,ip=127.0.0.1,port=1234 \
            --add-endpoint=instance=my-instance2

    To remove two endpoints from a network endpoint group:

        $ gcloud beta compute network-endpoint-groups update my-neg \
            --zone=us-central1-a \
            --remove-endpoint=instance=my-instance1,ip=127.0.0.1,port=1234 \
            --remove-endpoint=instance=my-instance2

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network endpoint group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     These flags can be specified multiple times to add/remove multiple
     endpoints.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --add-endpoint=[fqdn=FQDN],[instance=INSTANCE],[ip=IP],[port=PORT]
          The network endpoint to add to the network endpoint group. Keys used
          depend on the endpoint type of the NEG.

          gce-vm-ip-port

              *instance* - Name of instance in same zone as the network endpoint
              group.

              The VM instance must belong to the network / subnetwork
              associated with the network endpoint group. If the VM instance
              is deleted, then any network endpoint group that has a reference
              to it is updated.

              *ip* - Optional IP address of the network endpoint. the IP address
              must belong to a VM in compute engine (either the primary IP or
              as part of an aliased IP range). If the IP address is not
              specified, then the primary IP address for the VM instance in
              the network that the network endpoint group belongs to is
              used.

              *port* - Required endpoint port unless NEG default port is set.

          internet-ip-port

              *ip* - Required IP address of the endpoint to attach. Must be
              publicly routable.

              *port* - Optional port of the endpoint to attach. If unspecified,
              the NEG default port is set. If no default port is set, the
              well-known port for the backend protocol is used instead
              (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

          internet-fqdn-port

              *fqdn* - Required fully qualified domain name to use to look up an
              external endpoint. Must be resolvable to a public IP address via
              public DNS.

              *port* - Optional port of the endpoint to attach. If unspecified,
              the NEG default port is set. If no default port is set, the
              well-known port for the backend protocol is used instead
              (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS or HTTP2).

              Example: `--add-endpoint="fqdn=backend.example.com,port=443"`

          non-gcp-private-ip-port

              *ip* - Required IP address of the network endpoint to attach. The
              IP address must belong to a VM not in Compute Engine and
              must be routable using a Cloud Router over VPN or an Interconnect connection.

              *port* - Required port of the network endpoint to attach unless the
              NEG default port is set.

          gce-vm-ip

              *instance* - Required instance name in same zone as the network
              endpoint group.

              The VM instance must belong to the network / subnetwork
              associated with the network endpoint group. If the VM instance
              is deleted, then any network endpoint group that has a reference
              to it is updated.

              *ip* - Optional IP address of the network endpoint to attach. The
              IP address must be the VM's network interface address. If not
              specified, the primary NIC address is used.

       --remove-endpoint=[fqdn=FQDN],[instance=INSTANCE],[ip=IP],[port=PORT]
          The network endpoint to detach from the network endpoint group. Keys
          used depend on the endpoint type of the NEG.

          gce-vm-ip-port

              *instance* - Required name of instance whose endpoint(s) to
              detach. If the IP address is unset, all endpoints for the
              instance in the NEG are detached.

              *ip* - Optional IP address of the network endpoint to detach.
              If specified port must be provided as well.

              *port* - Optional port of the network endpoint to detach.

          internet-ip-port

              *ip* - Required IP address of the network endpoint to detach.

              *port* - Optional port of the network endpoint to detach if the
              endpoint has a port specified.

          internet-fqdn-port

              *fqdn* - Required fully qualified domain name of the endpoint to
              detach.

              *port* - Optional port of the network endpoint to detach if the
              endpoint has a port specified.

          non-gcp-private-ip-port

              *ip* - Required IP address of the network endpoint to detach.

              *port* - Required port of the network endpoint to detach unless
              NEG default port is set.

          gce-vm-ip

              *instance* - Required name of instance with endpoints to
              detach. If the IP address is unset, all endpoints for the
              instance in the NEG are detached.

              *ip* - Optional IP address of the network endpoint to attach. The
              IP address must be the VM's network interface's primary IP
              address. If not specified, the primary NIC address is used.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the network endpoint group is global.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified
          and the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to
          select a zone (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
