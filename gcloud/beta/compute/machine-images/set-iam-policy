    gcloud beta compute machine-images set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for
        a Compute Engine machine image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute machine-images set-iam-policy MACHINE_IMAGE POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Sets the IAM policy for the given machine image as defined in a JSON
    or YAML file.

EXAMPLES
    The following command reads an IAM policy defined in a policy.json file        and sets the policy for the machine image `my-image`:

        $ gcloud beta compute machine-images set-iam-policy my-image \
            policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Machine image resource - The machine image to set the IAM policy for. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument machine_image on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       MACHINE_IMAGE
          ID of the machine image or fully qualified identifier for the machine
          image.

          To set the machine_image attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument machine_image on the command line.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
