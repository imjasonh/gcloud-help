    user 'test-user@gmail.com' to machine image 'my-image' run:

        $ gcloud beta compute machine-images add-iam-policy-binding \
            my-image --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.admin'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Machine image resource - The machine image for which to add IAM policy
     binding to. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are
     not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument machine_image on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       MACHINE_IMAGE
          ID of the machine image or fully qualified identifier for the machine
          image. To set the machine_image attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument machine_image on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
