            --role='roles/compute.admin'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Machine image resource - The machine image from which to remove the IAM
     policy binding. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the project attribute:

        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       MACHINE_IMAGE
          ID of the machine image or fully qualified identifier for the machine
          image. To set the machine_image attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument machine_image on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=PRINCIPAL

        Deleted principals have an additional deleted: prefix and a ?uid=UID
        suffix, where UID is a unique identifier for the principal. Example:
