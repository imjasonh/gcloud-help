NAME
    gcloud beta compute instant-snapshots delete - delete a Compute Engine
        instant snapshot

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instant-snapshots delete INSTANT_SNAPSHOT_NAME
        [INSTANT_SNAPSHOT_NAME ...] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instant-snapshots delete deletes a Compute
    Engine instant snapshot. A disk can be deleted only if it is not attached
    to any virtual machine instances.

EXAMPLES
    To delete Compute Engine instant snapshots with the names
    'instant-snapshot-1' and 'instant-snapshot-2', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instant-snapshots delete instant-snapshot-1 \
            instant-snapshot-2

    To list all instant snapshots that were created before a specific date, use
    the --filter flag with the gcloud beta compute instant-snapshots list
    command.

        $ gcloud beta compute instant-snapshots list \
            --filter="creationTimestamp<'2017-01-01'"

    For more information on how to use --filter with the list command, run $
    gcloud topic filters.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANT_SNAPSHOT_NAME [INSTANT_SNAPSHOT_NAME ...]
        Names of the instant snapshots to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the instant snapshots to delete. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the instant snapshots to delete. If not specified and the
          compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
          zone (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instant-snapshots delete
