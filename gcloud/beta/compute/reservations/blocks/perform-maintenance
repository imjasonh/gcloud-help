SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute reservations blocks perform-maintenance RESERVATION
        --block-name=BLOCK_NAME [--scope=SCOPE] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Perform maintenance on a reservation block within a reservation.

EXAMPLES
    To perform maintenance on a reservation block in reservation exr1 in
    my-zone with block name block1 with scope all, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations blocks perform-maintenance exr1 \
            --zone=my-zone --block-name=block1 --scope=all

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RESERVATION
        Name of the reservation to perform-maintenance.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --block-name=BLOCK_NAME
        The name of the reservation block.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --scope=SCOPE
        The maintenance scope to set for the reservation block. SCOPE must be
        one of:

         all
            Perform maintenance on all hosts in the reservation block.
         running
            Perform maintenance only on the hosts in the reservation block that
            have running VMs.
         unused
            Perform maintenance only on the hosts in the reservation block that
            don't have running VMs.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the reservation to perform-maintenance. If not specified and
        the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
        zone (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.
