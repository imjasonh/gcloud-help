DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a Compute Engine reservation.

EXAMPLES
    To create a Compute Engine reservation by specifying VM properties using an
    instance template, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations create my-reservation \
          --vm-count=1 \
          --source-instance-template=example-instance-template \
          --zone=fake-zone

    To create a Compute Engine reservation by directly specifying VM
    properties, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations create my-reservation \
          --vm-count=1 --machine-type=custom-8-10240 \
          --min-cpu-platform="Intel Haswell" \
          --accelerator=count=2,type=nvidia-tesla-v100 \
          --local-ssd=size=375,interface=scsi --zone=fake-zone

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RESERVATION
        Name of the reservation to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Manage the SpecificSKU reservation properties.

     This must be specified.

       --vm-count=VM_COUNT
          The number of VM instances that are allocated to this reservation.
          The value of this field must be an int in the range [1, 1000].

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --require-specific-reservation
          Indicates whether the reservation can be consumed by VMs with "any
          reservation" defined. If enabled, then only VMs that target this
          reservation by name using --reservation-affinity=specific can consume
          from this reservation.

       --resource-policies=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The resource policies to include in this reservation. If you omit
          this flag, no resource policies are added. You can specify any string
          as the key, and specify the name of a resource policy as the value.

       Manage the instance properties for the SpecificSKU reservation.

       Exactly one of these must be specified:

         --source-instance-template=SOURCE_INSTANCE_TEMPLATE
            The url of the instance template that will be used to populate the
            fields of the reservation. Instance properties can not be defined
            in addition to source instance template.

         Define the individual instance properties for the SpecificSKU
         reservation.

           --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
              The type of machine (name only) that has a fixed number of vCPUs
              and a fixed amount of memory. You can also specify a custom
              machine type by using the pattern
              custom-number_of_CPUs-amount_of_memory-for example,
              custom-32-29440.

              This flag argument must be specified if any of the other
              arguments in this group are specified.

           --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
              Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator
              cards attached.
               count
                  The number of accelerators to attach to each instance in the
                  reservation.
               type
                  The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla
                  K80) of accelerator to attach to instances in the
                  reservation. Use gcloud compute accelerator-types list to
                  learn about all available accelerator types.

           --local-ssd=[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
              Manage the size and the interface of local SSD to use. See
              https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for more
              information.
               interface
                  The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD.
                  Valid values are scsi and nvme. SCSI is the default and is
                  supported by more guest operating systems. NVME may provide
                  higher performance.
               size
                  The size of the local SSD in base-2 GB.

           --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM
              Optional minimum CPU platform of the reservation to create.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description of the reservation to create.

     --reservation-sharing-policy=RESERVATION_SHARING_POLICY
        The reservation sharing policy to use for this reservation.
        RESERVATION_SHARING_POLICY must be one of:

         ALLOW_ALL
            The reservation can be shared with Google Cloud services.
         DISALLOW_ALL
            The reservation won't be shared with Google Cloud services. If you
            omit this flag during creation, the default value is DISALLOW_ALL.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the reservation to create. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Manage auto-delete properties for reservations.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --delete-after-duration=DELETE_AFTER_DURATION
          Automatically deletes the reservations after a specified number of
          days, hours, minutes, or seconds from its creation. For example,
          specify 30m for 30 minutes, or 1d2h3m4s for 1 day, 2 hours, 3
          minutes, and 4 seconds. For more information, see $ gcloud topic
          datetimes.

       --delete-at-time=DELETE_AT_TIME
          Automatically deletes the reservation at a specific time from its
          creation. The specified time must be an RFC3339 timestamp, which must
          be formatted as "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" where YYYY = year, MM = month,
          DD = day, HH = hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = time zone
          in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, specify
          2021-11-20T07:00:00Z.

     Manage the properties of a shared reservation.

       --share-setting=SHARE_SETTING
          Specify if this reservation is shared, and if so, the type of
          sharing. If you omit this flag, this value is local (not shared) by
          default. SHARE_SETTING must be one of: local, projects.

       --share-with=SHARE_WITH,[SHARE_WITH,...]
          If this reservation is shared (--share-setting is not local), provide
          a list of all of the specific projects that this reservation is
          shared with. List must contain project IDs or project numbers.
