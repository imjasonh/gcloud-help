        [--add-share-with=PROJECT,[PROJECT,...]]
        [--remove-share-with=PROJECT,[PROJECT,...]]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update Compute Engine reservations.

EXAMPLES
    To add project-1,project-2,project-3 to the list of projects that are
    shared with a Compute Engine reservation, my-reservation in zone:
    us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations update my-reservation \
          --add-share-with=project-1,project-2,project-3 \
          --zone=us-central1-a

    To remove project-1,project-2,project-3 from the list of projects that are
    shared with a Compute Engine reservation, my-reservation in zone:
    us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations update my-reservation \
          --remove-share-with=project-1,project-2,project-3 \
          --zone=us-central1-a

    To update the entire list of projects that are shared with a Compute Engine
    reservation, my-reservation in zone: us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations update my-reservation \
          --share-with=project-1,project-2,project-3 --zone=us-central1-a

    To update the number of reserved VM instances to 500 for a Compute Engine
    reservation, my-reservation in zone: us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations update my-reservation \
          --zone=us-central1-a --vm-count=500

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RESERVATION
        Name of the reservation to update.

FLAGS
     --add-share-with=PROJECT,[PROJECT,...]
        A list of specific projects to add to the list of projects that this
        reservation is shared with. List must contain project IDs or project
        numbers.

     --remove-share-with=PROJECT,[PROJECT,...]
        A list of specific projects to remove from the list of projects that
        this reservation is shared with. List must contain project IDs or
        project numbers.

     --share-with=SHARE_WITH,[SHARE_WITH,...]
        If this reservation is shared (--share-setting is not local), provide a
        list of all of the specific projects or folders that this reservation
        is shared with. List must contain project IDs or project numbers or
        folder IDs.

     --vm-count=VM_COUNT
        The number of VM instances that are allocated to this reservation. The
        value of this field must be an int in the range [1, 1000].

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the reservation to update. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
