DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update Compute Engine reservations.

EXAMPLES
    To add project-1,project-2,project-3 to the list of projects that are
    shared with a Compute Engine reservation, my-reservation in zone:
    us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations update my-reservation \
          --add-share-with=project-1,project-2,project-3 \
          --zone=us-central1-a

    To remove project-1,project-2,project-3 from the list of projects that are
    shared with a Compute Engine reservation, my-reservation in zone:
    us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations update my-reservation \
          --remove-share-with=project-1,project-2,project-3 \
          --zone=us-central1-a

    To update the entire list of projects that are shared with a Compute Engine
    reservation, my-reservation in zone: us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations update my-reservation \
          --share-with=project-1,project-2,project-3 --zone=us-central1-a

    To update the number of reserved VM instances to 500 for a Compute Engine
    reservation, my-reservation in zone: us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute reservations update my-reservation \
          --zone=us-central1-a --vm-count=500

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RESERVATION
        Name of the reservation to update.

FLAGS
     --add-share-with=PROJECT,[PROJECT,...]
        If this reservation is shared (--share-setting is projects), then
        specify a comma-separated list of projects to share the reservation
        with. You must list the projects using project IDs or project numbers.

     --[no-]enable-emergent-maintenance
        Enables the reservation to receive notifications when urgent
        maintenance for a GPU VM starts after the VM encounters a host error.
        Use --enable-emergent-maintenance to enable and
        --no-enable-emergent-maintenance to disable.

     --remove-share-with=PROJECT,[PROJECT,...]
        A list of specific projects to remove from the list of projects that
        this reservation is shared with. List must contain project IDs or
        project numbers.

     --reservation-sharing-policy=RESERVATION_SHARING_POLICY
        The reservation sharing policy to use for this reservation.
        RESERVATION_SHARING_POLICY must be one of:

         ALLOW_ALL
            The reservation can be shared with Google Cloud services.
         DISALLOW_ALL
            The reservation won't be shared with Google Cloud services. If you
            omit this flag during creation, the default value is DISALLOW_ALL.

     --share-setting=SHARE_SETTING
        The projects that can use the reservation. SHARE_SETTING must be one
        of:

         local
            Only your project can use the reservation. This is the default
            value.
         projects
            Your project and up to 100 other projects within your project's
            organization can use the reservation. If you specify this value,
            then you must also include the --share-with flag in the command.

     --share-with=SHARE_WITH,[SHARE_WITH,...]
        If this reservation is shared (--share-setting=projects), then specify
        a comma-separated list of projects to share the reservation with. List
        projects using project IDs or project numbers.

     --vm-count=VM_COUNT
        The number of VM instances that are allocated to this reservation. The
        value of this field must be an int in the range [1, 1000].

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the reservation to update. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Manage auto-delete properties for reservations.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --delete-after-duration=DELETE_AFTER_DURATION
          Automatically deletes the reservations after a specified number of
          days, hours, minutes, or seconds from its creation. For example,
          specify 30m for 30 minutes, or 1d2h3m4s for 1 day, 2 hours, 3
          minutes, and 4 seconds. For more information, see $ gcloud topic
          datetimes.

       --delete-at-time=DELETE_AT_TIME
          Automatically deletes the reservation at a specific time from its
          creation. The specified time must be an RFC3339 timestamp, which must
          be formatted as "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" where YYYY = year, MM = month,
          DD = day, HH = hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = time zone
          in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, specify
          2021-11-20T07:00:00Z.

       --disable-auto-delete
          Disables the auto-delete setting for the reservation.
