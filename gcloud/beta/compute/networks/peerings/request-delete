NAME
    gcloud beta compute networks peerings request-delete - request deletion of
        a Compute Engine network peering

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute networks peerings request-delete NAME --network=NETWORK
        [--async] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute networks peerings request-delete is used to
    request deletion of a consensus peering between virtual networks. The
    peering can be deleted if both sides request deletion.

EXAMPLES
    To request deletion of a consensus peering with the name 'peering-name'
    between the network 'local-network' and the network 'peer-network', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute networks peerings request-delete \
          peering-name --network=local-network

        $ gcloud beta compute networks peerings request-delete \
          peering-name --network=peer-network

    To complete the deletion, run gcloud compute networks peerings delete for
    each side of the peering.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the peering.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The name of the network in the current project containing the peering.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
