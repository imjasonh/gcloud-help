NAME
    gcloud beta compute networks peerings create - create a Compute Engine
        network peering

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute networks peerings create NAME --network=NETWORK
        --peer-network=PEER_NETWORK [--async] [--auto-create-routes]
        [--export-custom-routes] [--export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip]
        [--import-custom-routes] [--import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip]
        [--peer-project=PEER_PROJECT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute networks peerings create is used to create
    peerings between virtual networks. Each side of a peering association is
    set up independently. Peering will be active only when the configuration
    from both sides matches.

EXAMPLES
    To create a network peering with the name 'peering-name' between the
    network 'local-network' and the network 'peer-network' which exports and
    imports custom routes and subnet routes with public IPs, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute networks peerings create peering-name \
            --network=local-network --peer-network=peer-network \
            --export-custom-routes --import-custom-routes \
            --export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip \
            --import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the peering.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The name of the network in the current project to be peered with the
        peer network.

     --peer-network=PEER_NETWORK
        The name of the network to be peered with the current network.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --auto-create-routes
        (DEPRECATED) If set, will automatically create routes for the network
        peering. Flag auto-create-routes is deprecated. Peer network subnet
        routes are always created in a network when peered.

        Flag --auto-create-routes is deprecated and will be removed in a future
        release.

     --export-custom-routes
        If set, the network will export custom routes to peer network. Use
        --no-export-custom-routes to disable it.

     --export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip
        If set, the network will export subnet routes with addresses in the
        public IP ranges to peer network. Use
        --no-export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip to disable it.

     --import-custom-routes
        If set, the network will import custom routes from peer network. Use
        --no-import-custom-routes to disable it.

     --import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip
        If set, the network will import subnet routes with addresses in the
        public IP ranges from peer network. Use
        --no-import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip to disable it.

     --peer-project=PEER_PROJECT
        The name of the project for the peer network. If not specified,
        defaults to current project.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks peerings create

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks peerings create
