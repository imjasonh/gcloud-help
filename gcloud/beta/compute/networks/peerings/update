NAME
    gcloud beta compute networks peerings update - update a Compute Engine
        network peering

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute networks peerings update NAME --network=NETWORK
        [--export-custom-routes] [--export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip]
        [--import-custom-routes] [--import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

EXAMPLES
    To update the peering named peering-name to both export and import custom
    routes, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute networks peerings update peering-name \
          --export-custom-routes \
          --import-custom-routes

    To update the peering named peering-name to both export and import subnet
    routes with public ip, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute networks peerings update peering-name \
          --export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip \
          --import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the peering.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The name of the network in the current project to be peered with the
        peer network.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --export-custom-routes
        If set, the network will export custom routes to peer network. Use
        --no-export-custom-routes to disable it.

     --export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip
        If set, the network will export subnet routes with addresses in the
        public IP ranges to peer network. Use
        --no-export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip to disable it.

     --import-custom-routes
        If set, the network will import custom routes from peer network. Use
        --no-import-custom-routes to disable it.

     --import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip
        If set, the network will import subnet routes with addresses in the
        public IP ranges from peer network. Use
        --no-import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip to disable it.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
