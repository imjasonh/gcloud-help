NAME
    gcloud beta compute networks subnets describe - describe a Compute Engine
        subnetwork

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute networks subnets describe NAME [--region=REGION]
        [--view=VIEW] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute networks subnets describe displays all data
    associated with a Compute Engine subnetwork.

EXAMPLES
    To display all data associated with subnetwork subnet-1, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute networks subnets describe subnet-1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the subnetwork to describe.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to describe. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --view=VIEW
        Specifies the information that the output should contain. VIEW must be
        (only one value is supported):

         WITH_UTILIZATION
            Output includes the IP utilization data of all subnetwork ranges,
            showing total allocated and free IPv4 and IPv6 IPs.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks subnets describe

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks subnets describe
