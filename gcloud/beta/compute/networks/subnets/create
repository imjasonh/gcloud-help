DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute networks subnets create define a subnetwork for
    a network in custom subnet mode. Subnets must be uniquely named per region.

EXAMPLES
    To create the subnetwork subnet-1 with address range 10.10.0.0/24 in the
    network network-0, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute networks subnets create subnet-1 \
            --network=network-0 --range=10.10.0.0/24 --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the subnetwork to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The network to which the subnetwork belongs.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --[no-]allow-cidr-routes-overlap
        Allow/disallow this subnetwork's IP address ranges to conflict with
        existing custom routes. Use --allow-cidr-routes-overlap to enable and
        --no-allow-cidr-routes-overlap to disable.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description of this subnetwork.

     --enable-flow-logs
        Enable/disable VPC Flow Logs for this subnet. More information for VPC
        Flow Logs can be found at
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-flow-logs.

     --enable-private-ip-google-access
        Enable/disable access to Google Cloud APIs from this subnet for
        instances without a public ip address.

     --external-ipv6-prefix=EXTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX
        The /64 external IPv6 CIDR range to assign to this subnet. The range
        must be associated with an IPv6 BYOIP sub-prefix that is defined by the
        --ip-collection flag. If you specify --ip-collection but not
        --external-ipv6-prefix, a random /64 range is allocated from the
        sub-prefix.

        For example, --external-ipv6-prefix=2600:1901:0:0:0:0:0:0/64

     --internal-ipv6-prefix=INTERNAL_IPV6_PREFIX
        The /64 internal IPv6 CIDR range to assign to this subnet. The range
        must be associated with an IPv6 BYOIP sub-prefix that is defined by the
        --ip-collection flag. If you specify --ip-collection but not
        --internal-ipv6-prefix, a random /64 range is allocated from the
        sub-prefix.

        For example, --internal-ipv6-prefix 2600:1901:0:0:0:0:0:0/64

     --ip-collection=IP_COLLECTION
        Resource reference to a public delegated prefix. The
        PublicDelegatedPrefix must be a sub-prefix in
        EXTERNAL_IPV6_SUBNETWORK_CREATION or INTERNAL_IPV6_SUBNETWORK_CREATION
        mode.

     --ipv6-access-type=IPV6_ACCESS_TYPE
        IPv6 access type can be specified only when the subnet is created, or
        when the subnet is first updated to have a stack type of IPV4_IPV6.
        Once set, the access type is immutable. IPV6_ACCESS_TYPE must be one
        of:

         EXTERNAL
            VMs in this subnet can have external IPv6.
         INTERNAL
            VMs in this subnet can have internal IPv6.

     --logging-aggregation-interval=LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Toggles the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs. Increasing
        the interval time will reduce the amount of generated flow logs for
        long lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds per
        connection. LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL must be one of:
        interval-10-min, interval-15-min, interval-1-min, interval-30-sec,
        interval-5-min, interval-5-sec.

     --logging-filter-expr=LOGGING_FILTER_EXPR
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Export filter used to define which logs should be generated.

     --logging-flow-sampling=LOGGING_FLOW_SAMPLING
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling rate of VPC
        flow logs within the subnetwork where 1.0 means all collected logs are
        reported and 0.0 means no logs are reported. Default is 0.5 which means
        half of all collected logs are reported.

     --logging-metadata=LOGGING_METADATA
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the reported
        logs. Default is to exclude all metadata. LOGGING_METADATA must be one
        of: custom, exclude-all, include-all.

     --logging-metadata-fields=[METADATA_FIELD,...]
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled
        and "metadata" is set to CUSTOM_METADATA. The comma-separated list of
        metadata fields that should be added to reported logs.

     --private-ipv6-google-access-type=PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE
        The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs in this subnet.
        PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of: disable,
        enable-bidirectional-access, enable-outbound-vm-access.

     --purpose=PURPOSE

         PEER_MIGRATION
            Reserved for subnet migration between peered VPCs.
         PRIVATE
            Regular user created or automatically created subnet.
         PRIVATE_NAT
            Reserved for use as source range for Private NAT.
         PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT
            Reserved for Private Service Connect Internal Load Balancing.
         REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY
            Reserved for Regional Envoy-based Load Balancing.

     --range=RANGE
        The IP space allocated to this subnetwork in CIDR format.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to create. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --reserved-internal-range=RESERVED_INTERNAL_RANGE
        If set, the primary IP range of the subnetwork will be associated with
        the given internal range resource. If --range is set, the subnetwork
        will only use the given IP range, which must be contained by the IP
        range defined by the internal range resource. For example,
        --range=10.0.0.0/24 --reserved-internal-range
        //networkconnectivity.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT/locations/global/internalRanges/RANGE
        If --range is not set, the subnetwork will use the entire IP range
        defined by the internal range resource. For example,
        --reserved-internal-range
        //networkconnectivity.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT/locations/global/internalRanges/RANGE

     --resolve-subnet-mask=RESOLVE_SUBNET_MASK

        RESOLVE_SUBNET_MASK must be one of:

         ARP_ALL_RANGES
            VMs connected to this subnet receive ARP responses for IPv4
            addresses from any ranges of the subnet that are assigned to the
            VM's NIC. The DHCP responses contain the netmask of the subnet,
            instead of /32.

         ARP_PRIMARY_RANGE
            VMs connected to this subnet receive ARP responses only for IP
            addresses in the primary IPv4 range of the subnet. DHCP responses
            contain the netmask of the subnet, instead of /32.

     --resource-manager-tags=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A comma-separated list of Resource Manager tags to apply to the
        subnetwork.

     --role=ROLE
        The role of subnetwork. This field is required when the purpose is set
        to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY, REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY or
        INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. ROLE must be one of:

         ACTIVE
            The ACTIVE subnet that is currently used.
         BACKUP
            The BACKUP subnet that could be promoted to ACTIVE.

     --secondary-range=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]
        Adds a secondary IP range to the subnetwork for use in IP aliasing.

        For example, --secondary-range range1=192.168.64.0/24 adds a secondary
        range 192.168.64.0/24 with name range1.

        ◆ RANGE_NAME - Name of the secondary range.

     --secondary-range-with-reserved-internal-range=RANGE_NAME=INTERNAL_RANGE_URL,[...]
        Adds secondary IP ranges that are associated with internal range
        resources. For example, --secondary-range-with-reserved-internal-range
        range1=//networkconnectivity.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT/locations/global/internalRanges/RANGE
        adds a secondary range with the reserved internal range resource.
        ◆ RANGE_NAME - Name of the secondary range.
        ◆ INTERNAL_RANGE_URL - URL of an internal range resource.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
