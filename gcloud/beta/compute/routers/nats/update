DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute routers nats update is used to update a NAT in a
    Compute Engine router.

EXAMPLES
    Change subnetworks and IP address resources associated with NAT:

        $ gcloud beta compute routers nats update nat1 --router=my-router \
            --nat-external-ip-pool=ip-address2,ip-address3 \
            --nat-custom-subnet-ip-ranges=subnet-2,\
        subnet-3:secondary-range-2

    Change minimum default ports allocated per VM associated with NAT:

        $ gcloud beta compute routers nats update nat1 --router=my-router \
            --min-ports-per-vm=128

    Change connection timeouts associated with NAT:

        $ gcloud beta compute routers nats update nat1 --router=my-router \
            --udp-mapping-idle-timeout=60s --icmp-mapping-idle-timeout=60s \
            --tcp-established-connection-idle-timeout=60s \
            --tcp-transitory-connection-idle-timeout=60s

    Reset connection timeouts associated NAT to default values:

        $ gcloud beta compute routers nats update nat1 --router=my-router \
            --clear-udp-mapping-idle-timeout \
            --clear-icmp-mapping-idle-timeout \
            --clear-tcp-established-connection-idle-timeout \
            --clear-tcp-transitory-connection-idle-timeout

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the NAT to create

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --router=ROUTER
        The Router to use for NAT.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --auto-network-tier=AUTO_NETWORK_TIER
        The network tier to use when automatically reserving NAT IP addresses.
        AUTO_NETWORK_TIER must be one of:

         PREMIUM
            High quality, Google-grade network tier with support for all
            networking products.
         STANDARD
            Public internet quality, with only limited support for other
            networking products.

     --[no-]enable-dynamic-port-allocation
        Enable dynamic port allocation.

        If not specified, Dynamic Port Allocation is disabled by default.

        Use --enable-dynamic-port-allocation to enable and
        --no-enable-dynamic-port-allocation to disable.

     --enable-endpoint-independent-mapping
        Enable endpoint-independent mapping for the NAT (as defined in RFC
        5128).

        If not specified, NATs have endpoint-independent mapping disabled by
        default.

        Use --no-enable-endpoint-independent-mapping to disable
        endpoint-independent mapping.

     --enable-logging
        Enable logging for the NAT. Logs will be exported to Stackdriver. NAT
        logging is disabled by default. To disable logging for the NAT, use $
        gcloud beta compute routers nats update MY-NAT \ --no-enable-logging
        --router ROUTER --region REGION

     --log-filter=LOG_FILTER
        Filter for logs exported to stackdriver.

        The default is ALL.

        If logging is not enabled, filter settings will be persisted but will
        have no effect.

        Use --[no-]enable-logging to enable and disable logging.

        LOG_FILTER must be one of:

         ALL
            Export logs for all connections handled by this NAT.
         ERRORS_ONLY
            Export logs for connection failures only.
         TRANSLATIONS_ONLY
            Export logs for successful connections only.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the NAT to create. If not specified, you might be prompted to
        select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --rules=RULES
        Path to YAML file containing NAT Rules applied to the NAT. The YAML
        file format must follow the REST API schema for NAT Rules. See API
        Discovery docs
        (https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/compute/alpha/rest) for
        reference.

     At most one of these can be specified:

          Maximum ports to be allocated to a VM.

          This field can only be set when Dynamic Port Allocation is enabled
          and defaults to 65536. It must be set to a power of 2 that is greater
          than minPortsPerVm and at most 65536.

          Minimum ports to be allocated to a VM.

          If Dynamic Port Allocation is disabled, this defaults to 64.

    for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/routers/

    The alpha command uses the compute/alpha/routers API. Full documentation is
