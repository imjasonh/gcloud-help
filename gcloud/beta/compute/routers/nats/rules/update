DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute routers nats rules update is used to update a
    Rule in a Compute Engine NAT.

EXAMPLES
    To drain connections established using address-1 and use address-2 for all
    new connections matching Rule 1 in NAT nat-1, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute routers nats rules update 1 --nat=nat1 \
            --router=my-router --region=us-central1 \
            --source-nat-drain-ips=address-1 \
            --source-nat-active-ips=address-2

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RULE_NUMBER
        Number that uniquely identifies the Rule to update

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --nat=NAT
        Name of the NAT that contains the Rule

     --router=ROUTER
        The Router to use for NAT.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --match=MATCH
        CEL Expression used to identify traffic to which this rule applies.

        ◆ Supported attributes (Public NAT): destination.ip
        ◆ Supported attributes (Private NAT): nexthop.hub
        ◆ Supported methods (Public Nat): inIpRange
        ◆ Supported operators (Public NAT): ||, ==
        ◆ Supported operators (Private NAT): ==

        Examples of allowed Match expressions (Public NAT):
        ◆ 'inIpRange(destination.ip, "203.0.113.0/24")''
        ◆ 'destination.ip == "203.0.113.7"'
        ◆ 'destination.ip == "203.0.113.7" || inIpRange(destination.ip,
          "203.0.113.16/25")'

        Example of allowed Match expression (Private NAT):
        ◆ nexthop.hub ==
          "//networkconnectivity.googleapis.com/projects/p1/locations/global/hubs/h1"

     --region=REGION
        Region of the NAT containing the Rule to update. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --source-nat-active-ips=IP_ADDRESS,[IP_ADDRESS,...]
        External IP Addresses to use for connections matching this rule.

        These must be valid reserved external IPs in the same region.

     --source-nat-active-ranges=SUBNETWORK,[SUBNETWORK,...]
        Subnetworks from which addresses are used for connections matching this
        rule. This is only supported for Private NAT, and is required when
        creating a Private NAT gateway.

        These must be Subnetwork resources in the same region, with purpose set
        to PRIVATE_NAT.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-source-nat-drain-ips
          Clear drained IPs from the Rule

       --source-nat-drain-ips=IP_ADDRESS,[IP_ADDRESS,...]
          External IP Addresses to drain connections on.

          These must be external IPs previously used as active IPs on this
          rule. No new connections will be established using these IPs.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-source-nat-drain-ranges
          Clear drained ranges from the Rule

       --source-nat-drain-ranges=SUBNETWORK,[SUBNETWORK,...]
          Subnetwork ranges to drain connections on.

          These must be subnetworks previously used as active ranges on this
          rule. No new connections will be established using these ranges.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
