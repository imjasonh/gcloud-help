NAME
    gcloud beta compute forwarding-rules delete - delete forwarding rules

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute forwarding-rules delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute forwarding-rules delete deletes one or more
    Compute Engine forwarding rules.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the forwarding rules to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the forwarding rules are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the forwarding rules to delete. If not specified, you might
          be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
