NAME
    gcloud beta compute backend-services delete-signed-url-key - delete Cloud
        CDN Signed URL key from a backend service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute backend-services delete-signed-url-key
        BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME --key-name=KEY_NAME [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute backend-services delete-signed-url-key is used
    to delete an existing Cloud CDN Signed URL key from a backend service.

    Cloud CDN Signed URLs give you a way to serve responses from the globally
    distributed CDN cache, even if the request needs to be authorized.

    Signed URLs are a mechanism to temporarily give a client access to a
    private resource without requiring additional authorization. To achieve
    this, the full request URL that should be allowed is hashed and
    cryptographically signed. By using the signed URL you give it, that one
    request will be considered authorized to receive the requested content.

    Generally, a signed URL can be used by anyone who has it. However, it is
    usually only intended to be used by the client that was directly given the
    URL. To mitigate this, they expire at a time chosen by the issuer. To
    minimize the risk of a signed URL being shared, it is recommended that the
    signed URL be set to expire as soon as possible.

    A 128-bit secret key is used for signing the URLs.

     BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME
        Name of the backend service to operate on.
