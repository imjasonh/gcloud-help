NAME
    gcloud beta compute backend-services get-health - get backend health
        statuses from a backend service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute backend-services get-health BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME
        [--global | --region=REGION] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute backend-services get-health is used to request
    the current health status of instances in a backend service. Every group in
    the service is checked and the health status of each configured instance is
    printed.

    If a group contains names of instances that don't exist or instances that
    haven't yet been pushed to the load-balancing system, they will not show
    up. Those that are listed as HEALTHY are able to receive load-balanced
    traffic. Those that are marked as UNHEALTHY are either failing the
    configured health-check or not responding to it.

    Since the health checks are performed continuously and in a distributed
    manner, the state returned by this command is the most recent result of a
    vote of several redundant health checks. Backend services that do not have
    a valid global forwarding rule referencing it will not be health checked
    and so will have no health status.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME
        Name of the backend service to operate on.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the backend service is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the backend service to operate on. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute backend-services get-health

        $ gcloud alpha compute backend-services get-health
