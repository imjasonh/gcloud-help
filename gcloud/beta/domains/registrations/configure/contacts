NAME
    gcloud beta domains registrations configure contacts - configure contact
        settings of a Cloud Domains registration

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta domains registrations configure contacts REGISTRATION
        [--contact-data-from-file=CONTACT_DATA_FILE_NAME]
        [--contact-privacy=CONTACT_PRIVACY] [--validate-only] [--async]
        [--notices=[NOTICE,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Configure registration's contact settings: email, phone number,
    postal address and also contact privacy.

    In some cases such changes have to be confirmed through an email sent to
    the registrant before they take effect. In order to resend the email,
    execute this command again.

    NOTE: Please consider carefully any changes to contact privacy settings
    when changing from "redacted-contact-data" to "public-contact-data." There
    may be a delay in reflecting updates you make to registrant contact
    information such that any changes you make to contact privacy (including
    from "redacted-contact-data" to "public-contact-data") will be applied
    without delay but changes to registrant contact information may take a
    limited time to be publicized. This means that changes to contact privacy
    from "redacted-contact-data" to "public-contact-data" may make the previous
    registrant contact data public until the modified registrant contact
    details are published.

EXAMPLES
    To start an interactive flow to configure contact settings for example.com,
    run:

        $ gcloud beta domains registrations configure contacts example.com

    To enable contact privacy for example.com, run:

        $ gcloud beta domains registrations configure contacts example.com \
            --contact-privacy=private-contact-data

    To change contact data for example.com according to information from a YAML
    file contacts.yaml, run:

        $ gcloud beta domains registrations configure contacts example.com \
            --contact-data-from-file=contacts.yaml

COMMONLY USED FLAGS
     --contact-data-from-file=CONTACT_DATA_FILE_NAME
        A YAML file containing the contact data for the domain's three
        contacts: registrant, admin, and technical.

        The file can either specify a single set of contact data with label
        'allContacts', or three separate sets of contact data with labels
        'adminContact' and 'technicalContact'.

        If 'registrantContact', 'adminContact' or 'technicalContact' labels are
        used then only the specified contacts are updated.

        Each contact data must contain values for all required fields: email,
        phoneNumber and postalAddress in google.type.PostalAddress format.

        For more guidance on how to specify postalAddress, please see:

     --contact-privacy=CONTACT_PRIVACY
        The contact privacy mode to use. Supported privacy modes depend on the
        domain. CONTACT_PRIVACY must be one of:

         private-contact-data
            (DEPRECATED) Your contact info won't be available to the public. To
            help protect your info and prevent spam, a third party provides
            alternate (proxy) contact info for your domain in the public
            directory at no extra cost. They will forward received messages to
            you. The private-contact-data option is deprecated; See
            https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/deprecations/feature-deprecations.
         public-contact-data
            All the data from contact config is publicly available. To set this
            value, you must also pass the --notices flag with value
            public-contact-data-acknowledgement or agree to the notice
            interactively.
         redacted-contact-data
            Limited personal information will be available to the public. The
            actual information redacted depends on the domain. For more
            information see https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3251242.

     --validate-only
        Don't actually configure contact settings of the registration. Only
        validate arguments.

OTHER FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --notices=[NOTICE,...]
        Notices about special properties of contacts. NOTICE must be (only one
        value is supported):

         public-contact-data-acknowledgement
            By sending this notice you acknowledge that using
            public-contact-data contact privacy makes all the data from contact
            config publicly available.
