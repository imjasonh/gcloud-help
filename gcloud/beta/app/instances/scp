NAME
    gcloud beta app instances scp - SCP from or to the VM of an App Engine
        Flexible environment instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta app instances scp [INSTANCE:]SRC [[INSTANCE:]SRC ...]
        [INSTANCE:]DEST [--compress] [--recurse] [--service=SERVICE]
        [--tunnel-through-iap] [--version=VERSION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta app instances scp lets you remotely copy files to or
    from an App Engine Flexible environment instance.

    gcloud beta app instances scp resolves the instance's IP address and
    pre-populates the VM with a public key managed by gcloud. If the gcloud
    managed key pair does not exist, it is generated the first time an SSH
    command is run, which may prompt you for a passphrase for the private key
    encryption.

    All SSH commands require the OpenSSH client suite to be installed on Linux
    and Mac OS X. On Windows, the Google Cloud CLI comes with a bundled PuTTY
    suite instead, so it has no external dependencies.

EXAMPLES
    To copy one file from a remote instance to the local machine, run:

        $ gcloud beta app instances scp --service=s1 --version=v1 \
          i1:remote_file local_file

    To copy several local files to a remote instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta app instances scp --service=s1 --version=v1 local_1 \
          local_1 i1:remote_dir

    To use recursive copy, run:

        $ gcloud beta app instances scp --service=s1 --version=v1 \
          --recurse local_dir i1:remote_dir
