NAME
    gcloud beta app instances ssh - SSH into the VM of an App Engine Flexible
        instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta app instances ssh INSTANCE [--container=CONTAINER]
        [--service=SERVICE, -s SERVICE] [--version=VERSION, -v VERSION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...] [-- COMMAND ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta app instances ssh lets you remotely log in to your
    running App Engine Flexible instances.

    gcloud beta app instances ssh resolves the instance's IP address and
    pre-populates the VM with a public key managed by gcloud. If the gcloud
    managed key pair does not exist, it is generated the first time an SSH
    command is run, which may prompt you for a passphrase for the private key
    encryption.

    All SSH commands require the OpenSSH client suite to be installed on Linux
    and Mac OS X. On Windows, the Google Cloud CLI comes with a bundled PuTTY
    suite instead, so it has no external dependencies.

EXAMPLES
    To SSH into an App Engine Flexible instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta app instances ssh --service=s1 --version=v1 i1

    To SSH into the app container within an instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta app instances ssh --service=s1 --version=v1 i1 \
          --container=gaeapp

    To SSH into the app container and run a remote command, run:

        $ gcloud beta app instances ssh --service=s1 --version=v1 i1 \
          --container=gaeapp -- echo hello

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        The instance ID.

     [-- COMMAND ...]
        Remote command to execute on the VM.

        The '--' argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
        left and COMMAND on the right.

FLAGS
     --container=CONTAINER
        Name of the container within the VM to connect to.

     --service=SERVICE, -s SERVICE
        The service ID.

     --version=VERSION, -v VERSION
        The version ID.
