NAME
    gcloud beta batch tasks list - list tasks for a specified Batch job

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta batch tasks list (--job=JOB : --location=LOCATION)
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Currently, since Batch only supports one taskGroup, group0, the
    command takes --job as the required argument and will list all tasks in
    group0 of the job.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ The job specified does not exist.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to access the given job

EXAMPLES
    To print all tasks in the job with name
    projects/foo/locations/us-central1/jobs/bar, run:

        $ gcloud beta batch tasks list \
            --job projects/foo/locations/us-central1/jobs/bar

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Job resource - The Batch job resource. If not specified,the current
     batch/location is used. The arguments in this group can be used to specify
     the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --job on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       --job=JOB
          ID of the job or fully qualified identifier for the job.

          To set the job attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --job on the command line.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location for the job.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --job on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property batch/location.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud batch tasks list

        $ gcloud alpha batch tasks list
