        snapshots

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta debug snapshots COMMAND [--target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) (DEPRECATED) Commands for interacting with Cloud Debugger snapshots.

    Cloud Debugger is deprecated and will be shutdown May 31, 2023.

    See: https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/deprecations

    Commands to interact with debug snapshots. Snapshots allow you to capture
    stack traces and local variables from running services without interfering
    with the normal function of the service.

FLAGS
     --target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)
        The debug target. It may be a target ID or name obtained from 'debug
        targets list', or it may be a regular expression uniquely specifying a
        debuggee based on its description or name. For App Engine projects, if
        not specified, the default target is the most recent deployment of the
        default module and version.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
