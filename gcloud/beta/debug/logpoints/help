NAME
    gcloud beta debug logpoints - commands for interacting with Cloud Debugger
        logpoints

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta debug logpoints COMMAND [--target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) (DEPRECATED) Commands for interacting with Cloud Debugger logpoints.

    Cloud Debugger is deprecated and will be shutdown May 31, 2023.

    See: https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/deprecations

    Logpoints allow you to inject logging into running services without
    restarting or interfering with the normal function of the service. Log
    output will be sent to the appropriate log for the target's environment. On
    App Engine, for example, output will go to the request log.

EXAMPLES
    The following command would log the value of the "name" attribute of the
    "product" variable whenever any request executes line 123 of the file
    product.py:

        $ gcloud beta debug logpoints create product.py:123 \
          "No description for {product.name}"

    The log output will appear wherever explicit logging output from your
    program is normally written. For example, for an App Engine Standard
    application, the output would appear in the request log.

    If you want to log output only when certain runtime conditions are met, you
    can add a "--condition" option:

        $ gcloud beta debug logpoints create product.py:123 \
          "Suspicious price: {product.name} costs {price}" \
          --condition "price < .50"

    Logpoints remain active for 24 hours after creation. If you want to disable
    a logpoint, use the logpoints delete command:

        $ gcloud beta debug logpoints delete product.*

    The above command would delete all logpoints in any file whose name begins
    with "product". If you want to delete only a single logpoint, you should
    first determine the logpoint ID using the logpoints list command, then
    delete that specific ID:

        $ gcloud beta debug logpoints list ID LOCATION ... \
          567890abcdef1-1234-56789 product.py:123 ...
        $ gcloud beta debug logpoints delete 567890abcdef1-1234-56789

    For App Engine services, logpoint resources include the "logQuery"
    property, which is suitable for use with the "gcloud beta logging read"
    command. You can save this property's value and use it to read logs from
    the command line:

        $ log_query=$(gcloud beta debug logpoints create product.py:123 \
          "No description for {product.name}" --format="value(logQuery)")
        $ gcloud logging read "$log_query"

FLAGS
     --target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)
        The debug target. It may be a target ID or name obtained from 'debug
        targets list', or it may be a regular expression uniquely specifying a
        debuggee based on its description or name. For App Engine projects, if
        not specified, the default target is the most recent deployment of the
        default module and version.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     create
        (BETA) (DEPRECATED) Add debug logpoints to a Cloud Debugger debug
        target (debuggee).

     delete
        (BETA) (DEPRECATED) Delete debug logpoints for a Cloud Debugger debug
        target (debuggee).

     list
        (BETA) (DEPRECATED) List the debug logpoints for a Cloud Debugger debug
        target (debuggee).

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud debug logpoints
