NAME
    gcloud beta debug logpoints delete - delete debug logpoints for a Cloud
        Debugger debug target (debuggee)

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta debug logpoints delete [ID ...] [--all-users]
        [--include-inactive] [--location=LOCATION-REGEXP]
        [--target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) (DEPRECATED) Cloud Debugger is deprecated and will be shutdown May
    31, 2023.

    See: https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/deprecations

    gcloud beta debug logpoints delete is used to delete logpoints from a Cloud
    Debugger debug target (debuggee). It will ask for confirmation before
    deleting any logpoints. To suppress confirmation, use the global --quiet
    option.

EXAMPLES
    To delete all active debug logpoints created by the current user of the
    debug target (debuggee), without being prompted for confirmation, run:

        $ gcloud beta debug logpoints delete --target=<debuggee_id> --quiet

    To delete all active and inactive debug logpoints created by all users of
    the debug target (debuggee), run:

        $ gcloud beta debug logpoints delete --target=<debuggee_id> \
            --include-inactive --all-users

    To delete the debug logpoints with IDs 'ID1' and 'ID2' (where ID1 and ID2
    were each created by different users) of the debug target (debuggee), run:

        $ gcloud beta debug logpoints delete ID1 ID2 \
            --target=<debuggee_id> --all-users

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [ID ...]
        Zero or more logpoint resource identifiers. The specified logpoints
        will be deleted.

FLAGS
     --all-users
        If set, any location regexp will match logpoints from all users, rather
        than only logpoints created by the current user. This flag is not
        required when specifying the exact ID of a logpoint created by another
        user.

     --include-inactive
        If set, any location regexp will also match inactive logpoints, rather
        than only logpoints which have not expired. This flag is not required
        when specifying the exact ID of an inactive logpoint.

     --location=LOCATION-REGEXP
        A regular expression to match against logpoint locations. All logpoints
        matching this value will be deleted. You may specify --location
        multiple times.

        EXAMPLE:

            gcloud beta debug logpoints delete \
                --location foo.py:[1-3] --location bar.py:4

     --target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)
        The debug target. It may be a target ID or name obtained from 'debug
        targets list', or it may be a regular expression uniquely specifying a
        debuggee based on its description or name. For App Engine projects, if
        not specified, the default target is the most recent deployment of the
        default module and version.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in beta and might change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud debug logpoints delete
