DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Deploy to Cloud Run from compose specification.

EXAMPLES
    To deploy a container from the source Compose file on Cloud Run:

        $ gcloud beta run compose up compose.yaml

    To deploy to Cloud Run with unauthenticated access:

        $ gcloud beta run compose up compose.yaml --allow-unauthenticated

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [COMPOSE_FILE]
        The compose yaml file to deploy from a Compose directory to Cloud Run.

FLAGS
     --[no-]allow-unauthenticated
        Whether to enable allowing unauthenticated access to the service. This
        may take a few moments to take effect. Use --allow-unauthenticated to
        enable and --no-allow-unauthenticated to disable.

     --dry-run
        If set to true, only validates the configuration. The configuration
        will not be applied.

     --region=REGION
        Region in which the resource can be found. Alternatively, set the
        property [run/region].

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --build
          Force build of images.

       --no-build
          Skip building from source if applicable.
