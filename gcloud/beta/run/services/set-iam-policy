NAME
    gcloud beta run services set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for a service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta run services set-iam-policy SERVICE POLICY_FILE
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a service, given a
    service and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If
    the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will
    succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag
    obtain via get-iam-policy will prevent the replacement if the policy for
    the service has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not
    contain an etag value will replace any existing policy for the service.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for a service with identifier 'my-service'

        $ gcloud beta run services set-iam-policy --region=us-central1 \
            my-service policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - The service for which to set the IAM policy. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument service on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

      ◆ provide the argument service on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --region on the command line;

      ◆ specify from a list of available regions in a prompt.

     This must be specified.

        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
