DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This set of commands can be used to view and manage your existing
    Cloud Run services.

    To create new deployments, use gcloud beta run deploy.

EXAMPLES
    To list your deployed services, run:

FLAGS
     --platform=PLATFORM; default="managed"
        Target platform for running commands. Alternatively, set the property
        [run/platform]. PLATFORM must be one of:

         managed
            Fully managed version of Cloud Run. Use with the --region flag or
            set the [run/region] property to specify a Cloud Run region.
         gke
            Cloud Run for Anthos on Google Cloud. Use with the --cluster and
            --cluster-location flags or set the [run/cluster] and
            [run/cluster_location] properties to specify a cluster in a given
            zone.
         kubernetes
            Use a Knative-compatible kubernetes cluster. Use with the
            --kubeconfig and --context flags to specify a kubeconfig file and
            the context for connecting.

     Arguments to locate resources, depending on the platform used.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run (fully managed). Specify
       --platform=managed to use:

         --region=REGION
            Region in which the resource can be found. Alternatively, set the
            property [run/region].

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on Google
       Cloud. Specify --platform=gke to use:

         Cluster resource - Kubernetes Engine cluster to connect to. The
         arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
         resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group
         but can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
          ▫ provide the argument --cluster on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▫ set the property run/cluster with a fully specified name;
          ▫ specify the cluster from a list of available clusters with a
            fully specified name;
          ▫ provide the argument --project on the command line;
          ▫ set the property core/project.

           --cluster=CLUSTER
              ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.
              To set the cluster attribute:
              ◇ provide the argument --cluster on the command line;
              ◇ set the property run/cluster;
              ◇ specify the cluster from a list of available clusters.

           --cluster-location=CLUSTER_LOCATION
              Zone in which the cluster is located. Alternatively, set the
              property [run/cluster_location]. To set the location attribute:
              ◇ provide the argument --cluster on the command line with a
                fully specified name;
              ◇ set the property run/cluster with a fully specified name;
              ◇ specify the cluster from a list of available clusters with a
                fully specified name;
              ◇ provide the argument --cluster-location on the command line;
              ◇ set the property run/cluster_location;
              ◇ specify the cluster location from a list of available zones.

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on
       VMware. Specify --platform=kubernetes to use:

         --context=CONTEXT
            The name of the context in your kubectl config file to use for
            connecting.

         --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG
            The absolute path to your kubectl config file. If not specified,
            the colon- or semicolon-delimited list of paths specified by
            $KUBECONFIG will be used. If $KUBECONFIG is unset, this defaults to
            ~/.kube/config.
