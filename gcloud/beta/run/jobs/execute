SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta run jobs execute [JOB] [--region=REGION] [--async | --wait]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Execute a job.

EXAMPLES
    To execute a job:

        $ gcloud beta run jobs execute my-job

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Job resource - Job to execute. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument JOB on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ specify the job name from an interactive prompt with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

       [JOB]
          ID of the Job or fully qualified identifier for the Job.

          To set the jobs attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument JOB on the command line;
          ▸ specify the job name from an interactive prompt.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region in which the resource can be found. Alternatively, set the
        property [run/region].

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --async
          Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
          complete.

       --wait
          Wait until the execution has completed running before exiting. If not
          set, gcloud exits successfully when the execution has started.
