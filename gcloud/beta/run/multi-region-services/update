EXAMPLES
    To update one or more env vars:

        $ gcloud beta run multi-region-services update myservice \
          --update-env-vars=KEY1=VALUE1,KEY2=VALUE2

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - Service to update the configuration of. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.

       [SERVICE]
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service.

          To set the service attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument SERVICE on the command line;
          ▸ specify the service name from an interactive prompt.

       --namespace=NAMESPACE
          Specific to Cloud Run for Anthos: Kubernetes namespace for the
          service.

          To set the namespace attribute:

            specified name;
          ▸ specify the service name from an interactive prompt with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --namespace on the command line;
          ▸ set the property run/namespace;
          ▸ For Cloud Run on Kubernetes Engine, defaults to "default".
            Otherwise, defaults to project ID.;
          ▸ provide the argument project on the command line;
          ▸ set the property core/project.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --breakglass=JUSTIFICATION
        Justification to bypass Binary Authorization policy constraints and
        allow the operation. See
        https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization/docs/using-breakglass for
        more information. Next update or deploy command will automatically
        clear existing breakglass justification.

     --clear-vpc-connector
        Remove the VPC connector for this resource.

     --concurrency=CONCURRENCY
        Set the maximum number of concurrent requests allowed per container
        instance. Leave concurrency unspecified or provide the special value
        'default' to receive the server default value.

     --container=CONTAINER
        Specifies a container by name. Flags following --container will apply
        to the specified container.

     --[no-]cpu-boost
        Whether to allocate extra CPU to containers on startup to reduce the
        perceived latency of a cold start request. Enabled by default when
        unspecified on new services. Use --cpu-boost to enable and
        --no-cpu-boost to disable.

     --[no-]cpu-throttling
        Whether to throttle the CPU when the container is not actively serving
        requests. Use --cpu-throttling to enable and --no-cpu-throttling to
        disable.

     --[no-]default-url
        Toggles the default url for a run service. This is enabled by default
        if not specified. Use --default-url to enable and --no-default-url to
        disable.

     --[no-]deploy-health-check
        Schedules a single instance of the Revision and waits for it to pass
        its startup probe for the deployment to succeed. If disabled, the
        startup probe runs only when the revision is first started via
        invocation or by setting min-instances. This check is enabled by
        default when unspecified. Use --deploy-health-check to enable and
        --no-deploy-health-check to disable.

     --execution-environment=EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT
        Selects the execution environment where the application will run.
        EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT must be one of:

         gen1
            Run the application in a first generation execution environment.
         gen2
            Run the application in a second generation execution environment.

     --gpu-type=GPU_TYPE
        The GPU type to use.

     --ingress=INGRESS; default="all"
        Set the ingress traffic sources allowed to call the service. For Cloud
        Run the --[no-]allow-unauthenticated flag separately controls the
        identities allowed to call the service. INGRESS must be one of:

         all
            Inbound requests from all sources are allowed.
         internal
            For Cloud Run, only inbound requests from VPC networks in the same
            project or VPC Service Controls perimeter, as well as Pub/Sub
            subscriptions and Eventarc events in the same project or VPC
            Service Controls perimeter are allowed. All other requests are
            rejected. See https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/ingress
            for full details on the definition of internal traffic for Cloud
            Run.

         internal-and-cloud-load-balancing
            Only inbound requests from Google Cloud Load Balancing or a traffic
            source allowed by the internal option are allowed.

     --[no-]invoker-iam-check
        Optionally disable invoker IAM checks. This feature is available by
        invitation only. More info at
        https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/managing-access#invoker_check.
        Use --invoker-iam-check to enable and --no-invoker-iam-check to
        disable.

     --max-instances=MAX_INSTANCES
        The maximum number of container instances of the Service to run. Use
        'default' to unset the limit and use the platform default.

     --mesh=MESH
        Enables Cloud Service Mesh using the specified mesh resource name. Mesh
        resource name must be in the format of
        projects/PROJECT/locations/global/meshes/MESH_NAME.

     --min=MIN
        The minimum number of container instances for this Service to run or
        'default' to remove any minimum. These instances will be divided among
        all Revisions receiving a percentage of traffic.

     --min-instances=MIN_INSTANCES
        The minimum number of container instances for this Revision of the
        Service to run or 'default' to remove any minimum.

     --region=REGION
        Region in which the resource can be found. Alternatively, set the
        property [run/region].

     --remove-containers=[CONTAINER,...]
        List of containers to remove.

     --revision-suffix=REVISION_SUFFIX
        Specify the suffix of the revision name. Revision names always start
        with the service name automatically. For example, specifying
        [--revision-suffix=v1] for a service named 'helloworld', would lead to
        a revision named 'helloworld-v1'. Set empty string to clear the suffix
        and resume server-assigned naming.

     --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        the email address of an IAM service account associated with the
        revision of the service. The service account represents the identity of
        the running revision, and determines what permissions the revision has.

     --[no-]session-affinity
        Whether to enable session affinity for connections to the service. Use
        --session-affinity to enable and --no-session-affinity to disable.

     --tag=TAG
        Traffic tag to assign to the newly created revision.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        Set the maximum request execution time (timeout). It is specified as a
        duration; for example, "10m5s" is ten minutes, and five seconds. If you
        don't specify a unit, seconds is assumed. For example, "10" is 10
        seconds.

     --no-traffic
        True to avoid sending traffic to the revision being deployed. Setting
        this flag assigns any traffic assigned to the LATEST revision to the
        specific revision bound to LATEST before the deployment. The effect is
        that the revision being deployed will not receive traffic.

        After a deployment with this flag the LATEST revision will not receive
        traffic on future deployments. To restore sending traffic to the LATEST
        revision by default, run the gcloud run services update-traffic command
        with --to-latest.

     --vpc-connector=VPC_CONNECTOR
        Set a VPC connector for this resource.

     --vpc-egress=VPC_EGRESS
        Specify which of the outbound traffic to send through Direct VPC egress
        or the VPC connector for this resource. This resource must have Direct
        VPC egress enabled or a VPC connector to set this flag. VPC_EGRESS must
        be one of:

         all
            (DEPRECATED) Sends all outbound traffic through Direct VPC egress
            or the VPC connector. Provides the same functionality as
            'all-traffic'. Prefer to use 'all-traffic' instead.
         all-traffic
            Sends all outbound traffic through Direct VPC egress or the VPC
            connector.
         private-ranges-only
            Default option. Sends outbound traffic to private IP addresses (RFC
            1918 and Private Google Access IPs) through Direct VPC egress or
            the VPC connector.

            Traffic to other Cloud Run services might require additional
            configuration. See
            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/private-networking#send_requests_to_other_services_and_services
            for more information.

     These flags modify the Cloud SQL instances this Service connects to. You
     can specify a name of a Cloud SQL instance if it's in the same project and
     region as your Cloud Run service; otherwise specify
     <project>:<region>:<instance> for the instance.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --add-cloudsql-instances=[CLOUDSQL-INSTANCES,...]
          Append the given values to the current Cloud SQL instances.

       --clear-cloudsql-instances
          Empty the current Cloud SQL instances.

       --remove-cloudsql-instances=[CLOUDSQL-INSTANCES,...]
          Remove the given values from the current Cloud SQL instances.

       --set-cloudsql-instances=[CLOUDSQL-INSTANCES,...]
          Completely replace the current Cloud SQL instances with the given
          values.

     These flags modify the custom audiences that can be used in the audience
     field of ID token for authenticated requests.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --add-custom-audiences=[CUSTOM-AUDIENCES,...]
          Append the given values to the current custom audiences.

       --clear-custom-audiences
          Empty the current custom audiences.

       --remove-custom-audiences=[CUSTOM-AUDIENCES,...]
          Remove the given values from the current custom audiences.

       --set-custom-audiences=[CUSTOM-AUDIENCES,...]
          Completely replace the current custom audiences with the given
          values.

     --add-volume=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a volume to the Cloud Run resource. To add more than one volume,
        specify this flag multiple times. Volumes must have a name and type
        key. Only certain values are supported for type. Depending on the
        provided type, other keys will be required. The following types are
        supported with the specified additional keys:

     --clear-volumes
        Remove all existing volumes from the Cloud Run resource, including
        volumes mounted as secrets

    Container Flags

        If the --container or --remove-containers flag is specified the following
        arguments may only be specified after a --container flag.

         --add-volume-mount=[volume=NAME,mount-path=MOUNT_PATH,...]
            Adds a mount to the current container. Must contain the keys
            volume=NAME and mount-path=/PATH where NAME is the name of a volume
            on this resource and PATH is the path within the container's
            filesystem to mount this volume.

         --args=[ARG,...]
            Comma-separated arguments passed to the command run by the
            container image. If not specified and no '--command' is provided,
            the container image's default Cmd is used. Otherwise, if not
            specified, no arguments are passed. To reset this field to its
            default, pass an empty string.

         --clear-volume-mounts
            Remove all existing mounts from the current container.

         --command=[COMMAND,...]
            Entrypoint for the container image. If not specified, the container
            image's default Entrypoint is run. To reset this field to its
            default, pass an empty string.

         --cpu=CPU
            Set a CPU limit in Kubernetes cpu units.

            Cloud Run supports values fractional values below 1, 1, 2, 4, and

            List of container dependencies to add to the current container.

         --image=IMAGE
            Name of the container image to deploy (e.g.
            us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello:latest).

         --memory=MEMORY
            Set a memory limit. Ex: 1024Mi, 4Gi.

         --port=PORT
            Container port to receive requests at. Also sets the $PORT
            environment variable. Must be a number between 1 and 65535,
            inclusive. To unset this field, pass the special value "default".
            If updating an existing service with a TCP startup probe pointing
            to the previous container port, this will also update the probe
            port.

         --remove-volume-mount=[MOUNT_PATH,...]
            Removes the volume mounted at the specified path from the current
            container.

              variables. All existing environment variables will be removed
              before the new environment variables are added. Example YAML
              content:

                  KEY_1: "value1"
                  KEY_2: "value 2"

           --set-env-vars=[KEY=VALUE,...]
              List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables. All
              existing environment variables will be removed first.

           Only --update-env-vars and --remove-env-vars can be used together.
           If both are specified, --remove-env-vars will be applied first.

             --remove-env-vars=[KEY,...]
                List of environment variables to be removed.

             --update-env-vars=[KEY=VALUE,...]
                List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables.

         Specify secrets to mount or provide as environment variables. Keys
         starting with a forward slash '/' are mount paths. All other keys
         correspond to environment variables. Values should be in the form
         SECRET_NAME:SECRET_VERSION. For example:
         '--update-secrets=/secrets/api/key=mysecret:latest,ENV=othersecret:1'
         will mount a volume at '/secrets/api' containing a file 'key' with the
         latest version of secret 'mysecret'. An environment variable named ENV
         will also be created whose value is version 1 of secret 'othersecret'.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --clear-secrets
              Remove all secrets.

              will be removed first.

           Only --update-secrets and --remove-secrets can be used together. If
           both are specified, --remove-secrets will be applied first.

             --remove-secrets=[KEY,...]
                List of secrets to be removed.

             --update-secrets=[KEY=VALUE,...]

          "default".

       --clear-binary-authorization
          Remove any previously set Binary Authorization policy.

     Specify config map to mount or provide as environment variables. Keys
     starting with a forward slash '/' are mount paths. All other keys
     correspond to environment variables. The values associated with each of
     these should be in the form CONFIG_MAP_NAME:KEY_IN_CONFIG_MAP; you may
     omit the key within the config map to specify a mount of all keys within
     the config map. For example:
     '--update-config-maps=/my/path=myconfig,ENV=otherconfig:key.json' will
     create a volume with config map 'myconfig' and mount that volume at
     '/my/path'. Because no config map key was specified, all keys in
     'myconfig' will be included. An environment variable named ENV will also
     be created whose value is the value of 'key.json' in 'otherconfig. Not
     supported on the fully managed version of Cloud Run.

     At most one of these can be specified:

          Remove all config-maps.

       --set-config-maps=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          List of key-value pairs to set as config-maps. All existing
          config-maps will be removed first.

       Only --update-config-maps and --remove-config-maps can be used together.
       If both are specified, --remove-config-maps will be applied first.

         --remove-config-maps=[KEY,...]
            List of config-maps to be removed.

            List of key-value pairs to set as config-maps.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-encryption-key-shutdown-hours
          Remove any previously set CMEK key shutdown hours setting.

       --encryption-key-shutdown-hours=ENCRYPTION_KEY_SHUTDOWN_HOURS
          The number of hours to wait before an automatic shutdown server after
          CMEK key revocation is detected.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-key
          Remove any previously set CMEK key reference.

       --key=KEY
          CMEK key reference to encrypt the container with.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud beta run multi-region-services update --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud beta run multi-region-services update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

          An alias to --update-labels.

       --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
          is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-network
          Disconnect this Cloud Run service from the VPC network it is
          connected to.

       Direct VPC egress setting flags group.

         --network=NETWORK
            The VPC network that the Cloud Run service will be able to send
            traffic to. If --subnet is also specified, subnet must be a
            subnetwork of the network specified by this --network flag. To
            clear existing VPC network settings, use --clear-network.

         --subnet=SUBNET
            The VPC subnetwork that the Cloud Run service will get IPs from.
            The subnetwork must be /26 or larger. If --network is also
            specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified by
            the --network flag. If --network is not specified, network will be
            looked up from this subnetwork. To clear existing VPC network
            settings, use --clear-network.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --clear-network-tags
              Clears all existing Compute Engine tags from the Cloud Run
              service.

           --network-tags=[TAG,...]
              Applies the given Compute Engine tags (comma separated) to the
              Cloud Run service. To clear existing tags, use
              --clear-network-tags.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-post-key-revocation-action-type

          POST_KEY_REVOCATION_ACTION_TYPE must be one of:

           prevent-new
              No new instances will be started after CMEK key revocation.
           shut-down
              No new instances will be started and the existing instances will
              be shut down after CMEK key revocation.
