NAME
    gcloud artifacts rules create - create an Artifact Registry rule

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud artifacts rules create
        (RULE : --location=LOCATION --repository=REPOSITORY) --action=ACTION
        [--condition=CONDITION] [--operation=OPERATION; default="DOWNLOAD"]
        [--package=PACKAGE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create a new Artifact Registry rule.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      ▪ A rule with the same name already exists.
      ▪ The active account does not have permission to create repositories.
      ▪ A rule with given package already exists.

EXAMPLES
    To create a rule with the name my-rule for package my-pkg with action deny
    under the current project, repository, run:

        $ gcloud artifacts rules create my-rule --package=my-pkg \
            --action=deny

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

       --location=LOCATION

          artifacts/repository.

          To set the repository attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument rule on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --repository on the command line;
          ▸ set the property artifacts/repository.
