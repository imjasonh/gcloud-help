     --expire-behavior=EXPIRE_BEHAVIOR
        The expire behavior of a free trial instance. EXPIRE_BEHAVIOR must be
        one of:

         free-to-provisioned
            When the free trial instance expires, upgrade the instance to a
            provisioned instance.
         remove-after-grace-period
            When the free trial instance expires, disable the instance, and
            delete it after the grace period passes if it has not been upgraded
            to a provisioned instance.

     --instance-type=INSTANCE_TYPE
        Specifies the type for this instance. INSTANCE_TYPE must be one of:

         free-instance
            Free trial instances provide no guarantees for dedicated resources,
            both node_count and processing_units should be 0. They come with
            stricter usage limits and limited support.
         provisioned
            Provisioned instances have dedicated resources, standard usage
            limits, and support.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --nodes=NODES
          Number of nodes for the instance.

       --processing-units=PROCESSING_UNITS
          Number of processing units for the instance.
