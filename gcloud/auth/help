NAME
    gcloud auth - manage oauth2 credentials for the Google Cloud CLI

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud auth GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The gcloud auth command group lets you grant and revoke authorization to
    Google Cloud CLI (gcloud) to access Google Cloud. Typically, when scripting
    Google Cloud CLI tools for use on multiple machines, using gcloud auth
    activate-service-account is recommended.

    For more information on authorization and credential types, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing.

    While running gcloud auth commands, the --account flag can be specified to
    any command to use that account without activation.

EXAMPLES
    To authenticate a user account with gcloud and minimal user output, run:

        $ gcloud auth login --brief

    To list all credentialed accounts and identify the current active account,
    run:

        $ gcloud auth list

    To revoke credentials for a user account (like logging out), run:

        $ gcloud auth revoke test@gmail.com

    These flags are available to all commands: --help.
