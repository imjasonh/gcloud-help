NAME
    gcloud auth configure-docker - register gcloud as a Docker credential
        helper

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud auth configure-docker [REGISTRIES] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud auth configure-docker adds the Docker credHelper entry to Docker's
    configuration file, or creates the file if it doesn't exist. This will
    register gcloud as the credential helper for all Google-supported Docker
    registries. If the Docker configuration already contains a credHelper
    entry, it will be overwritten.

    Note: docker and gcloud need to be on the same system PATH to work
    correctly.

    Note: This command will not work for docker installed via Snap, as the
    docker snap package does not currently provide an interface for credential
    helpers.

    For more details on Docker registries, see
    https://docs.docker.com/registry/.

    For more details on how to authenticate to Google Container Registry using
    this command, see
    https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#gcloud-helper.

    For more details on Google Container Registry's standalone credential
    helpers, see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/docker-credential-gcr.

    https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credential-helpers.

EXAMPLES
    To configure docker authentication after logging into gcloud, run:

        $ gcloud auth configure-docker

    To configure docker authentication with Container Registry, e.g., gcr.io,
    run:

        $ gcloud auth configure-docker gcr.io

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [REGISTRIES]
        The comma-separated list of registries to configure the credential
        helper for. Container Registry is a service for storing private
        container images. For available registries, see
        https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling#add-registry.
