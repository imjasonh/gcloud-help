NAME
    gcloud auth application-default - manage your active Application Default
        Credentials

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud auth application-default COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Application Default Credentials (ADC) provide a method to get credentials
    used in calling Google APIs. The gcloud auth application-default command
    group allows you to manage active credentials on your machine that are used
    for local application development.

    These credentials are only used by Google client libraries in your own
    application.

    For more information about ADC and how it works, see Authenticating as a
    service account (https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production).

EXAMPLES
    To use your own user credentials for your application to access an API,
    run:

        $ gcloud auth application-default login

    This will take you through a web flow to acquire new user credentials.

    To create a service account and have your application use it for API
    access, run:

        $ gcloud iam service-accounts create my-account
        $ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
            --iam-account=my-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
        $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=key.json
        $ ./my_application.sh

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
