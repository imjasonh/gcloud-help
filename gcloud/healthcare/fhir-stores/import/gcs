NAME
    gcloud healthcare fhir-stores import gcs - import FHIR resources from
        Google Cloud Storage into a Cloud Healthcare API FHIR store

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud healthcare fhir-stores import gcs
        (FHIR_STORE : --dataset=DATASET --location=LOCATION) --gcs-uri=GCS_URI
        [--async] [--content-structure=CONTENT_STRUCTURE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Import FHIR resources from Google Cloud Storage into a Cloud Healthcare API
    FHIR store.

EXAMPLES
    To import the FHIR resources from the existing bucket 'testGcsBucket' in
    the folder 'someFolder' into the FHIR store 'test-fhir-store', run:

        $ gcloud healthcare fhir-stores import gcs test-fhir-store \
            --gcs-uri=gs://testGcsBucket/someFolder/* --dataset=test-dataset

    To perform the same import, but importing resources with the content
    structure of 'RESOURCE', run:

        $ gcloud healthcare fhir-stores import gcs test-fhir-store \
            --gcs-uri=gs://testGcsBucket/someFolder/* \
            --dataset=test-dataset --content-structure=RESOURCE

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FhirStore resource - Cloud Healthcare API FHIR store into which the data
     is imported. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the project
     attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument fhir_store on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       FHIR_STORE
          ID of the fhirStore or fully qualified identifier for the fhirStore.
          To set the fhir_store attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument fhir_store on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --dataset=DATASET
          Cloud Healthcare dataset. To set the dataset attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument fhir_store on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --dataset on the command line.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument fhir_store on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property healthcare/location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --gcs-uri=GCS_URI
        Cloud Storage source data locations. Each Cloud Storage object should
        be a text file that contains newline-delimited JSON structures
        conforming to the FHIR standard. You can use wildcards to import
        multiple files from one or more directories.
        ◆ Use * to match 0 or more non-separator characters. For example,
          gs://BUCKET/DIRECTORY/Example*.ndjson matches Example.ndjson and
          Example22.ndjson in DIRECTORY.
        ◆ Use ** to match 0 or more characters (including separators). Must
          be used at the end of a path and with no other wildcards in the path.
          Can also be used with a filename extension (such as .ndjson), which
          imports all files with the filename extension in the specified
          directory and its subdirectories. For example,
          gs://BUCKET/DIRECTORY/**.ndjson imports all files with the .ndjson
          filename extension in DIRECTORY and its subdirectories.
        ◆ Use ? to match 1 character. For example,
          gs://BUCKET/DIRECTORY/Example?.ndjson matches Example1.ndjson but
          does not match Example.ndjson or Example01.ndjson.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --content-structure=CONTENT_STRUCTURE
        Content structure in the source location. The default is BUNDLE.
        CONTENT_STRUCTURE must be one of:

         bundle
            Each unit is a bundle, which contains one or more resources.

         bundle-pretty
            The entire file is one JSON bundle. The JSON can span multiple
            lines.

         resource
            Each unit is a single resource.

         resource-pretty
            The entire file is one JSON resource. The JSON can span multiple
            lines.
