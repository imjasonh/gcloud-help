NAME
    gcloud compute disks delete - delete a Compute Engine disk

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute disks delete DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute disks delete deletes a Compute Engine disk. A disk can be
    deleted only if it is not attached to any virtual machine instances.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the disk 'my-disk' in zone 'us-east1-a', run:

        $ gcloud compute disks delete my-disk --zone=us-east1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
        Names of the disks to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the disks to delete. If not specified, you might be
          prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the disks to delete. If not specified and the compute/zone
          property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
          (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
