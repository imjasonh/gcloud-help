NAME
    gcloud compute disks bulk create - create multiple Compute Engine disks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute disks bulk create
        --source-consistency-group-policy=SOURCE_CONSISTENCY_GROUP_POLICY
        (--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute disks bulk create facilitates the creation of multiple
    Compute Engine disks with a single command. This includes cloning a set of
    Async PD secondary disks with the same consistency group policy.

EXAMPLES
    To consistently clone secondary disks with the same consistency group
    policy
    'projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/example-group-policy'
    to target zone 'us-central1-a', run:

        $ gcloud compute disks bulk create \
            --source-consistency-group-policy=projects/example-project/\
        regions/us-central1/resourcePolicies/example-group-policy \
            --zone=us-central1-a

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --source-consistency-group-policy=SOURCE_CONSISTENCY_GROUP_POLICY
        URL of the source consistency group resource policy. The resource
        policy is always the same region as the source disks.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Target region of the created disks, which currently must be the same
          as the source region. If not specified, you might be prompted to
          select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Target zone of the created disks, which currently must be the same as
          the source zone. If not specified and the compute/zone property isn't
          set, you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
