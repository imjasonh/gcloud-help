NAME
    gcloud compute networks create - create a Compute Engine network

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute networks create NAME
        [--bgp-routing-mode=MODE; default="regional"]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--[no-]enable-ula-internal-ipv6]
        [--internal-ipv6-range=INTERNAL_IPV6_RANGE] [--mtu=MTU]
        [--network-firewall-policy-enforcement-order=NETWORK_FIREWALL_POLICY_ENFORCEMENT_ORDER]
        [--range=RANGE] [--subnet-mode=MODE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute networks create is used to create virtual networks. A
    network performs the same function that a router does in a home network: it
    describes the network range and gateway IP address, handles communication
    between instances, and serves as a gateway between instances and callers
    outside the network.

EXAMPLES
    To create a regional auto subnet mode network with the name 'network-name',
    run:

        $ gcloud compute networks create network-name

    To create a global custom subnet mode network with the name 'network-name',
    run:

        $ gcloud compute networks create network-name \
            --bgp-routing-mode=global --subnet-mode=custom

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network to create.

FLAGS
     --bgp-routing-mode=MODE; default="regional"
        The BGP routing mode for this network. If not specified, defaults to
        regional.

        MODE must be one of:

         global
            Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from all
            regions to their BGP peers, and program instances in all regions
            with the router's best learned BGP routes.
         regional
            Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from their
            local region only to their BGP peers, and program instances in
            their local region only with the router's best learned BGP routes.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the network.

     --[no-]enable-ula-internal-ipv6
        Enable/disable ULA internal IPv6 on this network. Enabling this feature
        will assign a /48 from google defined ULA prefix fd20::/20.

        Use --enable-ula-internal-ipv6 to enable and
        --no-enable-ula-internal-ipv6 to disable.

     --internal-ipv6-range=INTERNAL_IPV6_RANGE
        When enabling ULA internal IPv6, caller can optionally specify the /48
        range they want from the google defined ULA prefix fd20::/20.
        ULA_IPV6_RANGE must be a valid /48 ULA IPv6 address and within the
        fd20::/20. Operation will fail if the speficied /48 is already in used
        by another resource. If the field is not speficied, then a /48 range
        will be randomly allocated from fd20::/20 and returned via this field.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        that can be transmitted on this network. Default value is 1460 bytes.
        The minimum value is 1300 bytes and the maximum value is 8896 bytes.
        The MTU advertised via DHCP to all instances attached to this network.

     --network-firewall-policy-enforcement-order=NETWORK_FIREWALL_POLICY_ENFORCEMENT_ORDER
        The Network Firewall Policy enforcement order of this network. If not
        specified, defaults to AFTER_CLASSIC_FIREWALL.

        NETWORK_FIREWALL_POLICY_ENFORCEMENT_ORDER must be one of:

         AFTER_CLASSIC_FIREWALL
            Network Firewall Policy is enforced after classic firewall.
         BEFORE_CLASSIC_FIREWALL
            Network Firewall Policy is enforced before classic firewall.

     --range=RANGE
        Specifies the IPv4 address range of legacy mode networks. The range
        must be specified in CIDR format:
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing

        This flag only works if mode is legacy
        (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc/legacy).

        Using legacy networks is **DEPRECATED**, given that many newer Google
        Cloud Platform features are not supported on legacy networks. Please be
        advised that legacy networks may not be supported in the future.

     --subnet-mode=MODE
        The subnet mode of the network. If not specified, defaults to AUTO.

        MODE must be one of:

         auto
            Subnets are created automatically. This is the recommended
            selection.
         custom
            Create subnets manually.
         legacy
            [Deprecated] Create an old style network that has a range and
            cannot have subnets. This is not recommended for new networks.
