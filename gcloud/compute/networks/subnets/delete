NAME
    gcloud compute networks subnets delete - delete Google Cloud subnetworks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute networks subnets delete NAME [NAME ...] [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute networks subnets delete deletes one or more Google Cloud
    subnetworks. Subnetworks can only be deleted when no other resources, such
    as VM instances, refer to them.".

EXAMPLES
    To delete the subnetwork subnet-1 in the us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud compute networks subnets delete subnet-1 \
            --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the subnetworks to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetworks to delete. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.
