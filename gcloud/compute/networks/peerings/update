NAME
    gcloud compute networks peerings update - update a Compute Engine network
        peering

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute networks peerings update NAME --network=NETWORK
        [--export-custom-routes] [--export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip]
        [--import-custom-routes] [--import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip]
        [--stack-type=STACK_TYPE] [--update-strategy=UPDATE_STRATEGY]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

EXAMPLES
    To update the peering named peering-name to both export and import custom
    routes, run:

        $ gcloud compute networks peerings update peering-name \
            --export-custom-routes --import-custom-routes

    To update the peering named peering-name to both export and import subnet
    routes with public ip, run:

        $ gcloud compute networks peerings update peering-name \
            --export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip \
            --import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the peering.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The name of the network in the current project to be peered with the
        peer network.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --export-custom-routes
        If set, the network will export custom routes to peer network. Use
        --no-export-custom-routes to disable it.

     --export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip
        If set, the network will export subnet routes with addresses in the
        public IP ranges to peer network. Use
        --no-export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip to disable it.

     --import-custom-routes
        If set, the network will import custom routes from peer network. Use
        --no-import-custom-routes to disable it.

     --import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip
        If set, the network will import subnet routes with addresses in the
        public IP ranges from peer network. Use
        --no-import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip to disable it.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        Stack type of the peering. If not specified, defaults to IPV4_ONLY.

        STACK_TYPE must be one of:

            IPV4_ONLY
               Only IPv4 traffic and routes will be exchanged across this peering.

            IPV4_IPV6
               IPv4 traffic and routes will be exchanged across this peering.
               IPv6 traffic and routes will be exchanged if the matching peering
               configuration also has stack_type set to IPV4_IPV6.

     --update-strategy=UPDATE_STRATEGY
        Update strategy of the peering. If not specified, defaults to
        INDEPENDENT.

        UPDATE_STRATEGY must be one of:

        INDEPENDENT Updates and deletes to the peering connection can be
        performed by either network admin.

        CONSENSUS Updates and deletes to the peering connection must be agreed
        upon by both network admins.
