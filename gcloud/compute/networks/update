DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute networks update is used to update Compute Engine networks.

EXAMPLES
    To update regional network with the name 'network-name' to global, run:

        $ gcloud compute networks update network-name \
            --bgp-routing-mode=global

    To update an auto subnet mode network with the name 'network-name' to
    custom subnet mode, run:

        $ gcloud compute networks update network-name \
            --switch-to-custom-subnet-mode

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network to operate on.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --[no-]enable-ula-internal-ipv6
        Enable/disable ULA internal IPv6 on this network. Enabling this feature
        will assign a /48 from google defined ULA prefix fd20::/20.

        Use --enable-ula-internal-ipv6 to enable and
        --no-enable-ula-internal-ipv6 to disable.

     --internal-ipv6-range=INTERNAL_IPV6_RANGE
        When enabling ULA internal IPv6, caller can optionally specify the /48
        range they want from the google defined ULA prefix fd20::/20.
        ULA_IPV6_RANGE must be a valid /48 ULA IPv6 address and within the
        fd20::/20. Operation will fail if the speficied /48 is already in used
        by another resource. If the field is not speficied, then a /48 range
        will be randomly allocated from fd20::/20 and returned via this field.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        that can be transmitted on this network. Default value is 1460 bytes.
        The minimum value is 1300 bytes and the maximum value is 8896 bytes.
        The MTU advertised via DHCP to all instances attached to this network.

     --network-firewall-policy-enforcement-order=NETWORK_FIREWALL_POLICY_ENFORCEMENT_ORDER
        The Network Firewall Policy enforcement order of this network. If not
        specified, defaults to AFTER_CLASSIC_FIREWALL.

        NETWORK_FIREWALL_POLICY_ENFORCEMENT_ORDER must be one of:

         AFTER_CLASSIC_FIREWALL
            Network Firewall Policy is enforced after classic firewall.
         BEFORE_CLASSIC_FIREWALL
            Network Firewall Policy is enforced before classic firewall.

     BGP Best Path Selection flags

     --bgp-best-path-selection-mode=BGP_BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE
        The BGP best path selection algorithm to be employed.
        BGP_BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE must be one of:

         LEGACY
            Dynamic routes are ranked based on the multiple exit-discriminator
            (MED) BGP attribute. When global routing is enabled, the MED of the
            routes received from other regions is the original MED plus the
            region-to-region cost.
         STANDARD
            Dynamic routes are ranked based on AS Path, Origin, Neighbor ASN
            and MED BGP attributes. When global routing is enabled,
            region-to-region cost is used as a tiebreaker. This mode offers
            customizations to fine-tune BGP best path routing with additional
            flags like --bgp-bps-always-compare-med and
            --bgp-bps-inter-region-cost

     --[no-]bgp-bps-always-compare-med
        Enables/disables the comparison of MED across routes with different
        Neighbor ASNs. This value can only be set if the
        --bgp-best-path-selection-mode is STANDARD. Use
        --bgp-bps-always-compare-med to enable and
        --no-bgp-bps-always-compare-med to disable.

     --bgp-bps-inter-region-cost=BGP_BPS_INTER_REGION_COST
        Defines the preferred approach for handling inter-region cost in the
        selection process. This value can only be set if the
        --bgp-best-path-selection-mode is STANDARD. BGP_BPS_INTER_REGION_COST
        must be one of:

         ADD_COST_TO_MED
            Adds inter-region cost to the MED before comparing the MED value.
            When multiple routes have the same value after the Add-cost-to-med
            comparison, the route selection continues and prefers the route
            with lowest cost.
         DEFAULT
            MED is compared as originally received from peers. When multiple
            routes have the same MED, cost is evaluated as the next step.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --bgp-routing-mode=MODE
          The target BGP routing mode for this network. MODE must be one of:

           global
              Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from all
              regions to their BGP peers, and program instances in all regions
              with the router's best learned BGP routes.
           regional
              Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from their
              local region only to their BGP peers, and program instances in
              their local region only with the router's best learned BGP
              routes.

       --switch-to-custom-subnet-mode
          Switch to custom subnet mode. This action cannot be undone.
