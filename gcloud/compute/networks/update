NAME
    gcloud compute networks update - update a Compute Engine network

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute networks update NAME [--async] [--mtu=MTU]
        [--bgp-routing-mode=MODE | --switch-to-custom-subnet-mode]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute networks update is used to update Compute Engine networks.

EXAMPLES
    To update regional network with the name 'network-name' to global, run:

        $ gcloud compute networks update network-name \
            --bgp-routing-mode=global

    To update an auto subnet mode network with the name 'network-name' to
    custom subnet mode, run:

        $ gcloud compute networks update network-name \
            --switch-to-custom-subnet-mode

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network to operate on.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        that can be transmitted on this network. Default value is 1460 bytes,
        and the maximum is 1500 bytes. The MTU advertised via DHCP to all
        instances attached to this network.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --bgp-routing-mode=MODE
          The target BGP routing mode for this network. MODE must be one of:

           global
              Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from all
              regions to their BGP peers, and program instances in all regions
              with the router's best learned BGP routes.
           regional
              Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from their
              local region only to their BGP peers, and program instances in
              their local region only with the router's best learned BGP
              routes.

       --switch-to-custom-subnet-mode
          Switch to custom subnet mode. This action cannot be undone.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
