DESCRIPTION
    Create Compute Engine commitments.

EXAMPLES
    To create a commitment called commitment-1 in the us-central1 region, with
    a 12-month plan, 9GB of memory and 4 vcpu cores, run:

        $ gcloud compute commitments create commitment-1 --plan=12-month \
            --resources=memory=9GB,vcpu=4 --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     COMMITMENT
        Name of the commitment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --plan=PLAN
        Duration of the commitment. PLAN must be one of: 12-month, 36-month.

     Manage the commitment for particular resources.

     At least one of these must be specified:

       --resources=[local-ssd=LOCAL-SSD],[memory=MEMORY],[vcpu=VCPU]
          Resources to be included in the commitment. For details and examples
          of valid specifications, refer to the custom machine type guide
          (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating-instance-with-custom-machine-type#specifications).
           memory
              The size of the memory, should include units (e.g. 3072MB or
              9GB). If no units are specified, GB is assumed.
           vcpu
              The number of the vCPU cores.
           local-ssd
              The size of local SSD.

       --resources-accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
          Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator cards
          to include in the commitment.
           count
              The number of accelerators to include.
           type
              The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for NVIDIA Tesla K80) of
              the accelerator. Use gcloud compute accelerator-types list to
              learn about all available accelerator types.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --auto-renew
        Enable auto renewal for the commitment.

     --custom-end-time=CUSTOM_END_TIME
        Specifies a custom future end date and extends the commitment's ongoing
        term.

     --merge-source-commitments=MERGE_SOURCE_COMMITMENTS
        Creates the new commitment by merging the specified source commitments
        and combining their resources.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the commitment to create. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --split-source-commitment=SPLIT_SOURCE_COMMITMENT
        Creates the new commitment by splitting the specified source commitment
        and redistributing the specified resources.

     --type=TYPE; default="general-purpose"
        Type of commitment. memory-optimized indicates that the commitment is
        for memory-optimized VMs. TYPE must be one of: accelerator-optimized,
        accelerator-optimized-a3, accelerator-optimized-a3-mega,
        accelerator-optimized-a3-ultra, accelerator-optimized-a4,

        storage-optimized-z3.

     Manage the reservations to be created with the commitment.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --existing-reservation=[name=NAME],[zone=ZONE]
          Details of the existing on-demand reservation or auto-created future
          reservation that you want to attach to your commitment. Specify a new
          instance of this flag for every existing reservation that you want to
          attach. The reservations must be in the same region as the
          commitment.
           name
              The name of the reservation.
           zone
              The zone of the reservation. For example, to attach an existing
              reservation named reservation-name in the zone reservation-zone,
              use the following text:
              --existing-reservation=name=reservation-name,zone=reservation-zone

       --reservations-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          Path to a YAML file of multiple reservations' configuration. Use a
          full or relative path to a local file containing the value of
          reservations.

       Manage the reservation to be created with the commitment.

         --reservation=RESERVATION
            Name of the reservation to operate on.

            This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --reservation-zone=RESERVATION_ZONE
            Zone of the reservation to operate on. If not specified and the
            compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a
            zone (interactive mode only).

            To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
            compute/zone property:

                $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

            A list of zones can be fetched by running:

                $ gcloud compute zones list

            To unset the property, run:

                $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

            Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
            CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

         Manage the specific SKU reservation properties to create.

           --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
              Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator
              cards attached.
               count
                  The number of accelerators to attach to each instance in the
                  reservation.
               type
                  The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla
                  K80) of accelerator to attach to instances in the
                  reservation. Use gcloud compute accelerator-types list to
                  learn about all available accelerator types.

           --local-ssd=[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
              Manage the size and the interface of local SSD to use. See
              https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for more
              information.
               interface
                  The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD.
                  Valid values are scsi and nvme. SCSI is the default and is
                  supported by more guest operating systems. NVME may provide
                  higher performance.
               size
                  The size of the local SSD in base-2 GB.

           --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
              The type of machine (name only) that has a fixed number of vCPUs
              and a fixed amount of memory. You can also specify a custom
              machine type by using the pattern
              custom-number_of_CPUs-amount_of_memory-for example,
              custom-32-29440.

           --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM
              Optional minimum CPU platform of the reservation to create.

           --require-specific-reservation
              Indicates whether the reservation can be consumed by VMs with
              "any reservation" defined. If enabled, then only VMs that target
              this reservation by name using --reservation-affinity=specific
              can consume from this reservation.

           --resource-policies=[KEY=VALUE,...]
              The resource policies to include in this reservation. If you omit
              this flag, no resource policies are added. You can specify any
              string as the key, and specify the name of a resource policy as
              the value.

           --vm-count=VM_COUNT
              The number of VM instances that are allocated to this
              reservation. The value of this field must be an int in the range
              [1, 1000].

         Manage the properties of a shared reservation to create

           --share-setting=SHARE_SETTING
              The projects that can use the reservation. SHARE_SETTING must be
              one of:

               local
                  Only your project can use the reservation. This is the
                  default value.
               projects
                  Your project and up to 100 other projects within your
                  project's organization can use the reservation. If you
                  specify this value, then you must also include the
                  --share-with flag in the command.

           --share-with=SHARE_WITH,[SHARE_WITH,...]
              If this reservation is shared (--share-setting=projects), then
              specify a comma-separated list of projects to share the
              reservation with. List projects using project IDs or project
              numbers.
