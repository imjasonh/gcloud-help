NAME
    gcloud compute resource-policies create workload-policy - create a Compute
        Engine workload resource policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute resource-policies create workload-policy NAME --type=TYPE
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--region=REGION]
        [--accelerator-topology=ACCELERATOR_TOPOLOGY
          | --max-topology-distance=MAX_TOPOLOGY_DISTANCE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create a Compute Engine workload resource policy.

EXAMPLES
    To create a workload policy:

        $ gcloud compute resource-policies create workload-policy NAME \
            --type=TYPE

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the resource policy to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --type=TYPE
        Type of the workload policy defining the high-level intent of the
        cluster. TYPE must be one of:

         HIGH_AVAILABILITY
            For workloads that aim to be highly available. Common examples are
            web / ML serving, or distributed database clusters. Compute Engine
            spreads VMs at best-effort to improve reliability of the
            distributed infrastructure.
         HIGH_THROUGHPUT
            For high throughput distributed workloads eg. HPC or ML training.
            Compute Engine collocates VMs at best-effort to reduce network
            latency between VMs.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the backend.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the resource policy to operate on. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --accelerator-topology=ACCELERATOR_TOPOLOGY
          Specifies the topology of placement and interconnection performance
          required to create a slice of VMs with interconnected accelerators.

       --max-topology-distance=MAX_TOPOLOGY_DISTANCE
          Specifies the topology of placement and interconnection network
          performance of the group of VMs (MIG / Multi-MIGs).
          MAX_TOPOLOGY_DISTANCE must be one of:

           BLOCK
              VMs are placed within the same block of capacity with improved
              latency compared to Cluster.
           CLUSTER
              VMs are placed within the same cluster of capacity with improved
              latency between them.
           SUBBLOCK
              Tightest collocation of VMs that provides minimized network
              latency. VMs are placed within the same rack of capacity with
              improved latency compared to Block.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute resource-policies create workload-policy

        $ gcloud beta compute resource-policies create workload-policy
