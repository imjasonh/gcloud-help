SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute resource-policies delete NAME [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete a Compute Engine resource policy.

EXAMPLES
    The following command deletes a Compute Engine resource policy.

        $ gcloud compute resource-policies delete my-resource-policy \
            --region=REGION

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the resource policy to operate on.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the resource policy to operate on. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.
