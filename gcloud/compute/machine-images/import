DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute machine-images import creates Compute Engine machine image
    from virtual appliance in OVA/OVF format.

    Importing OVF involves:
      ▪ Unpacking OVF package (if in OVA format) to Cloud Storage.
      ▪ Import disks from OVF to Compute Engine.
      ▪ Translate the boot disk to make it bootable in Compute Engine.
      ▪ Create a machine image using OVF metadata and imported disks.

    Virtual instances, images, machine images, and disks in Compute engine and
    files stored on Cloud Storage incur charges. See
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/importing-virtual-disks#resource_cleanup.

EXAMPLES
    To import an OVF package from Cloud Storage into a machine image named
    my-machine-image, run:

        $ gcloud compute machine-images import my-machine-image \
            --source-uri=gs://my-bucket/my-dir

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE
        Name of the machineImage to import.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --source-uri=SOURCE_URI
        Cloud Storage path to one of: OVF descriptor OVA file Directory with
        OVF package. For more information about Cloud Storage URIs, see
        https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints#json-api.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --no-address
        Temporary VMs are created in your project during machine image import.
        Set this flag so that these temporary VMs are not assigned external IP
        addresses.

        Note: The machine image import process requires package managers to be
        installed on the operating system for the virtual disk. These package
        managers might need to make requests to package repositories that are
        outside Google Cloud. To allow access for these updates, you need to
        configure Cloud NAT and Private Google Access. For more information,
        see https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/gce-example#create-nat and
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-access-options#pga.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --byol
        Specifies that you want to import an image with an existing license.
        Importing an image with an existing license is known as bring your own
        license (BYOL).

        --byol can be specified in any of the following ways:

            + `--byol --os=rhel-8`: imports a RHEL 8 image with an existing license.
            + `--os=rhel-8-byol`: imports a RHEL 8 image with an existing license.
            + `--byol`: detects the OS contained on the disk, and imports
               the image with an existing license.

        For more information about BYOL, see:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/bringing-your-own-licenses

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the VMs created from the imported machine image to
        send and receive packets with non-matching destination or source IP
        addresses.

     --compute-service-account=COMPUTE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        A temporary virtual machine instance is created in your project during
        machine image import. Machine image import tooling on this temporary
        instance must be authenticated.

        A Compute Engine service account is an identity attached to an
        instance. Its access tokens can be accessed through the instance
        metadata server and can be used to authenticate machine image import
        tooling on the instance.

        To set this option, specify the email address corresponding to the
        required Compute Engine service account. If not provided, the machine
        image import on the temporary instance uses the project's default
        Compute Engine service account.

        At minimum, the specified Compute Engine service account needs to have
        the following roles assigned:

        ◆ roles/compute.storageAdmin
        ◆ roles/storage.objectViewer

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a text description of the machine image.

     --guest-environment
        The guest environment will be installed on the machine image. Enabled
        by default, use --no-guest-environment to disable.

     --guest-flush
        Create an application-consistent machine image by informing the OS to
        prepare for the snapshot process.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --log-location=LOG_LOCATION
        Directory in Cloud Storage to hold build logs. If not set,
        gs://<project num>.cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/ is created
        and used.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network for the VMs that are created from the imported
        machine image. If --subnet is also specified, then the subnet must be a
        subnetwork of network specified by --network. If neither is specified,
        the default network is used.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the machine
        image. NETWORK_TIER must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default
        value is PREMIUM.

     --os=OS
        Specifies the OS of the machine image being imported. OS must be one
        of: centos-7, debian-10, debian-11, debian-8, debian-9, opensuse-15,
        rhel-6, rhel-6-byol, rhel-7, rhel-7-byol, rhel-8, rhel-8-byol, rocky-8,
        sles-12, sles-12-byol, sles-15, sles-15-byol, sles-sap-12,
        sles-sap-12-byol, sles-sap-15, sles-sap-15-byol, ubuntu-1404,

        windows-8-x64-byol, windows-8-x86-byol.

     --restart-on-failure
        The VMs created from the imported machine image are restarted if they
        are terminated by Compute Engine. This does not affect terminations
        performed by the user. Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure
        to disable.

     --storage-location=LOCATION
        Google Cloud Storage location, either regional or multi-regional, where
        machine image's content is to be stored. If absent, a nearby regional
        or multi-regional location is chosen automatically.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet for the VMs created from the imported machine
        image. If --network is also specified, the subnet must be a subnetwork
        of the network specified by --network.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the VMs created from the imported
        machine image. These tags allow network firewall rules and routes to be
        applied to specified VMs. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1)
        for more details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list VMs with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list VMs tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"
        Maximum time an import can last before it fails as "TIMEOUT". For
        example, if you specify 2h, the process fails after 2 hours. See $
        gcloud topic datetimes for information about duration formats.

        This timeout option has a maximum value of 24 hours.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the machine image to import. The zone in which to perform the
        import of the machine image. If not specified and the compute/zone
        property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive
        mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value specifying the number of cores that are needed
          in the custom machine type.

          For some machine types, shared-core values can also be used. For
          example, for E2 machine types, you can specify micro, small, or
          medium.

          This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed.

          This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies VM type. n1 - VMs with CPU platforms Skylake and older, n2
          - VMs with CPU platform Cascade Lake. n2 offers flexible sizing from
          2 to 80 vCPUs, and 1 to 640GBs of memory. It also features a number
          of performance enhancements including exposing a more accurate NUMA
          topology to the guest OS. The default is n1.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the machine image will be assigned the default
          scopes, described below. However, if neither --scopes nor --no-scopes
          are specified and the project has no default service account, then
          the machine image is imported with no scopes. Note that the level of
          access that a service account has is determined by a combination of
          access scopes and IAM roles so you must configure both access scopes
          and IAM roles for the service account to work properly.

          SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. Default
          scopes are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

       --no-scopes
          Import machine image without scopes

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          A service account is an identity attached to the machine image. Its
          access tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server
          and are used to authenticate applications on the instance. The
          account can be set using an email address corresponding to the
          required service account.

          If not provided, the machine image will use the project's default
          service account.

       --no-service-account
          Import machine image without service account
