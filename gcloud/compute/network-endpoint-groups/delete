NAME
    gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups delete - delete a Compute Engine
        network endpoint group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups delete NAME
        [--global | --region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete a Compute Engine network endpoint group.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a network endpoint group named my-neg:

        $ gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups delete my-neg \
            --zone=us-central1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network endpoint group to operate on.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the network endpoint group is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified
          and the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to
          select a zone (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
