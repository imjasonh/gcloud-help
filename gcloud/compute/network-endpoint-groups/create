DESCRIPTION
    Create a Compute Engine network endpoint group.

EXAMPLES
    To create a network endpoint group:

        $ gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups create my-neg \
            --zone=us-central1-a --network=my-network --subnet=my-subnetwork

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network endpoint group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --default-port=DEFAULT_PORT
        The default port to use if the port number is not specified in the
        network endpoint.

        If this flag isn't specified for a NEG with endpoint type
        gce-vm-ip-port or non-gcp-private-ip-port, then every network endpoint
        in the network endpoint group must have a port specified. For a NEG
        with endpoint type internet-ip-port and internet-fqdn-port. If the
        default port is not specified, the well-known port for your backend
        protocol is used (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

        This flag is not supported for NEGs with endpoint type serverless.

        This flag is not supported for NEGs with endpoint type
        private-service-connect.

     --network=NETWORK
        Name of the network in which the NEG is created. default project
        network is used if unspecified.

        This is only supported for NEGs with endpoint type gce-vm-ip-port,
        non-gcp-private-ip-port, gce-vm-ip, or private-service-connect.

        For Private Service Connect NEGs, you can optionally specify --network
        and --subnet if --psc-target-service points to a published service. If
        --psc-target-service points to the regional service endpoint of a
        Google API, do not specify --network or --subnet.

     --network-endpoint-type=NETWORK_ENDPOINT_TYPE; default="gce-vm-ip-port"
        Determines the spec of endpoints attached to this group.

         gce-vm-ip-port
            Endpoint IP address must belong to a VM in Compute Engine (either
            the primary IP or as part of an aliased IP range). The
            --default-port must be specified or every network endpoint in the
            network endpoint group must have a port specified.

         internet-ip-port
            Endpoint IP address must be a publicly routable address. If
            specified, the default port is used. If unspecified, the well-known
            port for your backend protocol is used as the default port (80 for
            HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

         internet-fqdn-port
            Endpoint FQDN must be resolvable to a public IP address via public
            DNS. The default port is used, if specified. If the default port is
            not specified, the well-known port for your backend protocol is
            used as the default port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

            After creating a NEG of this type, you can use the gcloud compute
            network-endpoint-groups update command with the --add-endpoint
            flag. Example: --add-endpoint="fqdn=backend.example.com,port=443"

         non-gcp-private-ip-port
            Endpoint IP address must belong to a VM not in Compute Engine and
            must be routable using a Cloud Router over VPN or an Interconnect
            connection. In this case, the NEG must be zonal. The --default-port
            must be specified or every network endpoint in the network endpoint
            group must have a port specified.

         serverless
            The network endpoint is handled by specified serverless
            infrastructure, such as Cloud Run, App Engine, or Cloud Function.
            Default port, network, and subnet are not effective for serverless
            endpoints.

         gce-vm-ip
            Endpoint must be the IP address of a VM's network interface in
            Compute Engine. Instance reference is required. The IP address is
            optional. If unspecified, the primary NIC address is used. A port
            must not be specified.

         private-service-connect
            The network endpoint corresponds to a service outside the VPC,
            accessed via Private Service Connect.

            NETWORK_ENDPOINT_TYPE must be one of: gce-vm-ip-port,
            internet-ip-port, internet-fqdn-port, non-gcp-private-ip-port,
            serverless, gce-vm-ip, private-service-connect.

     --psc-target-service=PSC_TARGET_SERVICE
        PSC target service name to add to the private service connect network
        endpoint groups (NEG).

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Name of the subnet to which all network endpoints belong.

        If not specified, network endpoints may belong to any subnetwork in the
        region where the network endpoint group is created.

        This is only supported for NEGs with endpoint type gce-vm-ip-port,
        gce-vm-ip, or private-service-connect. For Private Service Connect
        NEGs, you can optionally specify --network and --subnet if
        --psc-target-service points to a published service. If
        --psc-target-service points to the regional service endpoint of a
        Google API, do not specify --network or --subnet.

     The serverless routing configurations are only valid when endpoint type of
     the network endpoint group is serverless.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       Configuration for a Cloud Function network endpoint group. Cloud
       Function name must be provided explicitly or in the URL mask.

         --cloud-function-name=CLOUD_FUNCTION_NAME
            Cloud Function name to add to the Serverless NEG. The function must
            be in the same project and the same region as the Serverless
            network endpoint groups (NEG).

         --cloud-function-url-mask=CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL_MASK
            A template to parse function field from a request URL. URL mask
            allows for routing to multiple Cloud Functions without having to
            create multiple network endpoint groups and backend services.

       Configuration for a Cloud Run network endpoint group. Cloud Run service
       must be provided explicitly or in the URL mask. Cloud Run tag is
       optional, and may be provided explicitly or in the URL mask.

         --cloud-run-service=CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE
            Cloud Run service name to add to the Serverless network endpoint
            groups (NEG). The service must be in the same project and the same
            region as the Serverless NEG.

         --cloud-run-tag=CLOUD_RUN_TAG
            Cloud Run tag represents the "named revision" to provide additional
            fine-grained traffic routing configuration.

         --cloud-run-url-mask=CLOUD_RUN_URL_MASK
            A template to parse service and tag fields from a request URL. URL
            mask allows for routing to multiple Run services without having to
            create multiple network endpoint groups and backend services.

       Configuration for an App Engine network endpoint group. Both App Engine
       service and version are optional, and may be provided explicitly or in
       the URL mask. The app-engine-app flag is only used for default routing.
       The App Engine app must be in the same project as the Serverless network
       endpoint groups (NEG).

         --[no-]app-engine-app
            If set, the default routing is used. Use --app-engine-app to enable
            and --no-app-engine-app to disable.

         --app-engine-service=APP_ENGINE_SERVICE
            Optional serving service to add to the Serverless NEG.

         --app-engine-url-mask=APP_ENGINE_URL_MASK
            A template to parse service and version fields from a request URL.
            URL mask allows for routing to multiple App Engine services without
            having to create multiple network endpoint groups and backend
            services.

         --app-engine-version=APP_ENGINE_VERSION
            Optional serving version to add to the Serverless NEG.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the network endpoint group is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified
          and the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to
          select a zone (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.
