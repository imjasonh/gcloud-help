NAME
    gcloud compute target-ssl-proxies update - update a target SSL proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute target-ssl-proxies update NAME
        [--backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE] [--proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER]
        [--ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[...]]
        [--clear-ssl-policy | --ssl-policy=SSL_POLICY] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute target-ssl-proxies update is used to replace the SSL
    certificate, backend service, proxy header or SSL policy of existing target
    SSL proxies. A target SSL proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding
    rules which define which packets the proxy is responsible for routing. The
    target SSL proxy in turn points to a backend service which will handle the
    requests. The target SSL proxy also points to at most 15 SSL certificates
    used for server-side authentication. The target SSL proxy can be associated
    with at most one SSL policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target SSL proxy to update.

FLAGS
     --backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE
        A backend service that will be used for connections to the target SSL
        proxy.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER
        The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend.
        PROXY_HEADER must be one of:

         NONE
            No proxy header is added.
         PROXY_V1
            Enables PROXY protocol (version 1) for passing client connection
            information.

     --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[...]
        References to at most 15 SSL certificate resources that are used for
        server-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
        considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load
        balancer. The SSL certificates must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target SSL proxy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-ssl-policy
          Removes any attached SSL policy from the SSL proxy.

       --ssl-policy=SSL_POLICY
          A reference to an SSL policy resource that defines the server-side
          support for SSL features and affects the connections between clients
          and the SSL proxy load balancer. The SSL policy must exist and cannot
          be deleted while referenced by a target SSL proxy.
