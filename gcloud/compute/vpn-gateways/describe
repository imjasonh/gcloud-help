NAME
    gcloud compute vpn-gateways describe - describe a Compute Engine Highly
        Available VPN Gateway

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute vpn-gateways describe NAME [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute vpn-gateways describe is used to display all data associated
    with a Compute Engine Highly Available VPN Gateway in a project.

    Highly Available VPN Gateway provides a means to create a VPN solution with
    a higher availability SLA compared to Classic Target VPN Gateway. Highly
    Available VPN gateways are simply referred to as VPN gateways in the API
    documentation and gcloud commands. A VPN Gateway can reference one or more
    VPN tunnels that connect it to external VPN gateways or Cloud VPN Gateways.

EXAMPLES
    To describe a VPN gateway, run:

        $ gcloud compute vpn-gateways describe my-gateway \
          --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the VPN Gateway to describe.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the VPN Gateway to describe. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute vpn-gateways describe

        $ gcloud beta compute vpn-gateways describe
