NAME
    gcloud compute vpn-gateways delete - delete Compute Engine Highly Available
        VPN Gateways

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute vpn-gateways delete NAME [NAME ...] [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute vpn-gateways delete is used to delete one or more Compute
    Engine Highly Available VPN Gateways. VPN Gateways can only be deleted when
    no VPN tunnels refer to them.

    Highly Available VPN Gateway provides a means to create a VPN solution with
    a higher availability SLA compared to Classic Target VPN Gateway. Highly
    Available VPN gateways are simply referred to as VPN gateways in the API
    documentation and gcloud commands. A VPN Gateway can reference one or more
    VPN tunnels that connect it to external VPN gateways or Cloud VPN Gateways.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a VPN gateway, run:

        $ gcloud compute vpn-gateways delete my-gateway --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the VPN Gateways to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the VPN Gateways to delete. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:
