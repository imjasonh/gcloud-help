NAME
    gcloud compute routers nats rules delete - delete a Rule in a Compute
        Engine NAT

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute routers nats rules delete RULE_NUMBER [RULE_NUMBER ...]
        --nat=NAT --router=ROUTER [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute routers nats rules delete is used to delete a Rule on a
    Compute Engine NAT.

EXAMPLES
    To delete Rule 1 in NAT 'n1' in router 'r1', run:

        $ gcloud compute routers nats rules delete 1 --nat=n1 --router=r1 \
            --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RULE_NUMBER [RULE_NUMBER ...]
        Number that uniquely identifies the Rules to operate on

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --nat=NAT
        Name of the NAT that contains the Rule

     --router=ROUTER
        Router to use for NAT.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the NAT containing the Rules to delete. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute routers nats rules delete

        $ gcloud beta compute routers nats rules delete
