    gcloud compute routers create - create a Compute Engine router

SYNOPSIS

        [--advertisement-mode=MODE] [--asn=ASN] [--async]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--keepalive-interval=KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL]
        [--region=REGION] [--set-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]]
        [--set-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE=DESC,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute routers create is used to create a router to provide dynamic
    routing to VPN tunnels and interconnects.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the router to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The network for this router

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --advertisement-mode=MODE
        The new advertisement mode for this router. MODE must be one of:

         CUSTOM
            Custom (user-configured) BGP advertisements.
         DEFAULT
            Default (Google-managed) BGP advertisements.

     --asn=ASN
        The optional BGP autonomous system number (ASN) for this router. Must
        be a 16-bit or 32-bit private ASN as defined in
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6996, for example --asn=64512.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description of this router.

     --keepalive-interval=KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL
        The interval between BGP keepalive messages that are sent to the peer.
        If set, this value must be between 20 and 60 seconds. The default is 20
        seconds. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

        BGP systems exchange keepalive messages to determine whether a link or
        host has failed or is no longer available. Hold time is the length of
        time in seconds that the BGP session is considered operational without
        any activity. After the hold time expires, the session is dropped.

        Hold time is three times the interval at which keepalive messages are
        sent, and the hold time is the maximum number of seconds allowed to
        elapse between successive keepalive messages that BGP receives from a
        peer. BGP will use the smaller of either the local hold time value or
        the peer's hold time value as the hold time for the BGP connection
        between the two peers.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the router to create. If not specified, you might be prompted
        to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --set-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
        The list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to dynamically advertise on
        this router. This list can only be specified in custom advertisement
        mode.

        GROUP must be (currently only one value is supported):

         ALL_SUBNETS
            Automatically advertise all available subnets. This excludes any
            routes learned for subnets that use VPC Network Peering.

     --set-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE=DESC,...]
        The list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to dynamically
        advertise on this router. Each IP range can (optionally) be given a
        text description DESC. For example, to advertise a specific range, use
        --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24. To store a description with
        the range, use --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24=my-networks.
        This list can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS

    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
