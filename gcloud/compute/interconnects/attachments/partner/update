NAME
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update - update a Compute
        Engine partner interconnect attachment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update NAME
        [--candidate-cloud-router-ipv6-address=CANDIDATE_CLOUD_ROUTER_IPV6_ADDRESS]
        [--candidate-customer-router-ipv6-address=CANDIDATE_CUSTOMER_ROUTER_IPV6_ADDRESS]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--enable-admin] [--mtu=MTU]
        [--region=REGION] [--stack-type=STACK_TYPE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update is used to update
    partner interconnect attachments. A partner interconnect attachment binds
    the underlying connectivity of a provider's Interconnect to a path into and
    out of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to patch.

FLAGS
     --candidate-cloud-router-ipv6-address=CANDIDATE_CLOUD_ROUTER_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Single IPv6 address + prefix length to be configured on the cloud
        router interface for this interconnect attachment. Example:
        2001:db8::1/125

     --candidate-customer-router-ipv6-address=CANDIDATE_CUSTOMER_ROUTER_IPV6_ADDRESS
        Single IPv6 address + prefix length to be configured on the customer
        router interface for this interconnect attachment. Example:
        2001:db8::2/125

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. When this is
        enabled, the attachment is operational and will carry traffic. Use
        --no-enable-admin to disable it.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        passing through this interconnect attachment. Must be one of 1440,
        1460, 1500, or 8896. If not specified, the value will default to 1440.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to patch. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        Stack type of the protocol(s) enabled on this interconnect attachment.
        STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            Both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are enabled on this attachment.
         IPV4_ONLY
            Only IPv4 protocol is enabled on this attachment.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments partner update

        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments partner update
