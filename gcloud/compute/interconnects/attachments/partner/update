NAME
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update - update a Compute
        Engine partner interconnect attachment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update NAME
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--enable-admin] [--mtu=MTU]
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update is used to update
    partner interconnect attachments. A partner interconnect attachment binds
    the underlying connectivity of a provider's Interconnect to a path into and
    out of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to patch.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. When this is
        enabled, the attachment is operational and will carry traffic. Use
        --no-enable-admin to disable it.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        passing through this interconnect attachment. Only 1440 and 1500 are
        allowed values. If not specified, the value will default to 1440.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to patch. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
