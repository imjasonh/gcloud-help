DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create is used to create
    a dedicated interconnect attachments. An interconnect attachment is what
    binds the underlying connectivity of an interconnect to a path into and out
    of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interconnect=INTERCONNECT
        The interconnect for the interconnect attachment

     --router=ROUTER
        Google Cloud Router to use for dynamic routing.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --bandwidth=BANDWIDTH
        Provisioned capacity of the attachment. BANDWIDTH must be one of:

         50m
            50 Mbit/s
         100m
            100 Mbit/s
         200m
            200 Mbit/s

         10g
            10 Gbit/s
         20g

         100g
            100 Gbit/s

     --candidate-ipv6-subnets=[IPV6_SUBNET,...]
        The candididate-ipv6-subnets field is not available.

     --candidate-subnets=[SUBNET,...]
        Up to 16 candidate prefixes that can be used to restrict the allocation
        of cloudRouterIpAddress and customerRouterIpAddress for this
        attachment. All prefixes must be within link-local address space.
        Google attempts to select an unused subnet of SUBNET_LENGTH from the
        supplied candidate subnet(s), or all of link-local space if no subnets
        supplied. Google does not re-use a subnet already in-use by your
        project, even if it's contained in one of the candidate subnets. The
        request fails if all candidate subnets are in use at Google's edge.

     --cloud-router-ipv6-interface-id=INTERFACE_ID
        cloud-router-ipv6-interface-id field is not available.

     --customer-router-ipv6-interface-id=PEER_INTERFACE_ID
        customer-router-ipv6-interface-id field is not available.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. If not provided
        on creation, defaults to enabled. When this is enabled, the attachment
        is operational and will carry traffic. Use --no-enable-admin to disable
        it.

     --encryption=ENCRYPTION
        Indicates the user-supplied encryption option for this interconnect
        attachment (VLAN attachment).

        Possible values are:

        NONE - This is the default value, which means the interconnect
        attachment carries unencrypted traffic. VMs can send traffic to or
        receive traffic from such interconnect attachment.

        IPSEC - The interconnect attachment carries only traffic that is
        encrypted by an IPsec device; for example, an HA VPN gateway or
        third-party IPsec VPN. VMs cannot directly send traffic to or receive
        traffic from such an interconnect attachment. To use HA VPN over Cloud
        Interconnect, the interconnect attachment must be created with this
        option.

        ENCRYPTION must be one of: IPSEC, NONE.

     --ipsec-internal-addresses=[ADDRESSES]
        List of IP address range names that have been reserved for the
        interconnect attachment (VLAN attachment). Use this option only for an
        interconnect attachment that has its encryption option set as IPSEC.
        Currently only one internal IP address range can be specified for each
        attachment. When creating an HA VPN gateway for the interconnect
        attachment, if the attachment is configured to use a regional internal
        IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP address is allocated from the IP
        address range specified here. If this field is not specified when
        creating the interconnect attachment, then when creating any HA VPN
        gateways for this interconnect attachment, the HA VPN gateway's IP
        address is allocated from a regional external IP address pool.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet
        passing through this interconnect attachment. Must be one of 1440,
        1460, 1500, or 8896. If not specified, the value will default to 1440.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to create. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --stack-type=STACK_TYPE
        Stack type of the protocol(s) enabled on this interconnect attachment.
        STACK_TYPE must be one of:

         IPV4_IPV6
            Both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are enabled on this attachment.
         IPV4_ONLY
            Only IPv4 protocol is enabled on this attachment.

     --subnet-length=SUBNET_LENGTH
        Length of the IPv4 subnet mask for this attachment. 29 is the default
        value, except for attachments on Cross-Cloud Interconnects whose remote
        location's "constraints.subnetLengthRange" field specifies a minimum
        subnet length of 30. In that case, the default value is 30. The default
        value is recommended when there's no requirement on the subnet length.
        SUBNET_LENGTH must be one of: 29, 30.

     --vlan=VLAN
        Desired VLAN for this attachment, in the range 2-4093. If not supplied,
        Google will automatically select a VLAN.
