NAME
    gcloud compute project-info add-metadata - add or update project-wide
        metadata

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute project-info add-metadata
        [--metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute project-info add-metadata can be used to add or update
    project-wide metadata. Every instance has access to a metadata server that
    can be used to query metadata that has been set through this tool.
    Project-wide metadata entries are visible to all instances. To set metadata
    for individual instances, use gcloud compute instances add-metadata. For
    information on metadata, see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata

    Only metadata keys that are provided are mutated. Existing metadata entries
    will remain unaffected.

    If you are using this command to manage SSH keys for your project, please
    note the risks
    (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/adding-removing-ssh-keys#risks)
    of manual SSH key management as well as the required format for SSH key
    metadata, available at
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/adding-removing-ssh-keys

FLAGS
     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128
        bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for
        all metadata entries is 512 KB.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

        For startup scripts on Windows instances, the following metadata keys
        have special meanings: windows-startup-script-url,
        windows-startup-script-cmd, windows-startup-script-bat,
        windows-startup-script-ps1, sysprep-specialize-script-url,
        sysprep-specialize-script-cmd, sysprep-specialize-script-bat, and
        sysprep-specialize-script-ps1. For more information, see Running
        startup scripts (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript).

        At least one of [--metadata] or [--metadata-from-file] is required.

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

    At least one of [--metadata] or [--metadata-from-file] is required.
