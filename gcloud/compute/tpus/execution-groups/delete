NAME
    gcloud compute tpus execution-groups delete - delete TPU Node + VM created
        by execution group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute tpus execution-groups delete EXECUTION_GROUP_NAME
        [--tpu-only] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

EXAMPLES
    To delete both, the TPU and the VM, run:

        $ gcloud compute tpus execution-groups delete test-execution-group \
            --zone=test-zone --project=test-project

    To delete the TPU only, run:

        $ gcloud compute tpus execution-groups delete test-execution-group \
            --zone=test-zone --project=test-project --tpu-only

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     EXECUTION_GROUP_NAME
        The execution group name to delete.

FLAGS
     --tpu-only
        Do not delete VM, only delete the TPU.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the tpu to delete. If not specified and the compute/zone
        property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive
        mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute tpus execution-groups delete

        $ gcloud beta compute tpus execution-groups delete
