DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute health-checks create http2 is used to create a non-legacy
    health check using the HTTP/2 protocol. You can use this health check for
    Google Cloud load balancers or for managed instance group autohealing. For
    more information, see the health checks overview at:
    https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-check-concepts

EXAMPLES
    To create a HTTP2 health check with default options, run:

        $ gcloud compute health-checks create http2 my-health-check-name

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the HTTP2 health check to create.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value
        is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional string description for the HTTP2 health check.

     --enable-logging
        Enable logging of health check probe results to Stackdriver. Logging is
        disabled by default.

        Use --no-enable-logging to disable logging.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

     --host=HOST
        The value of the host header used for the health check. If unspecified,
        Google Cloud sets the host header to the IP address of the load
        balancer's forwarding rule.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER; default="NONE"
        The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend.
        PROXY_HEADER must be one of:

         NONE
            No proxy header is added.
         PROXY_V1
            Adds the header "PROXY UNKNOWN\r\n".

     --request-path=REQUEST_PATH; default="/"
        The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
        /healthcheck. The default value is ``/''.

     --response=RESPONSE
        When empty, status code of the response determines health. When not
        empty, presence of specified string in first 1024 characters of
        response body determines health. Only ASCII characters allowed.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. The default value is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the HTTP2 health check is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the HTTP2 health check to create. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     These flags configure the port that the health check monitors. If none is
     specified, the default port of 80 is used. If both --port and --port-name
     are specified, --port takes precedence.

       --port=PORT; default=80
          The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

       --port-name=PORT_NAME
          The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
          empty.

       --use-serving-port
          If given, use the "serving port" for health checks:

          ▸ When health checking network endpoints in a Network Endpoint
            Group, use the port specified with each endpoint.
            --use-serving-port must be used when using a Network Endpoint Group
            as a backend as this flag specifies the portSpecification option
            for a Health Check object.
          ▸ When health checking other backends, use the port or named port
            of the backend service.
