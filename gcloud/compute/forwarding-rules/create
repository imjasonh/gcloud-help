DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules create is used to create a forwarding rule.
    A forwarding rule directs traffic that matches a destination IP address
    (and possibly a TCP or UDP port) to a forwarding target (load balancer, VPN
    gateway or VM instance).

    Forwarding rules can be either global or regional, specified with the
    --global or --region=REGION flags. For more information about the scope of
    a forwarding rule, refer to
    https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts.

    Forwarding rules can be external, internal, internal managed, or internal
    self-managed, specified with the
    --load-balancing-scheme=[EXTERNAL|EXTERNAL_MANAGED|INTERNAL|INTERNAL_MANAGED|INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED]
    flag. External forwarding rules are accessible from the internet, while
    internal forwarding rules are only accessible from within their VPC
    networks. You can specify a reserved static external or internal IP address
    with the --address=ADDRESS flag for the forwarding rule. Otherwise, if the
    flag is unspecified, an ephemeral IP address is automatically assigned
    (global IP addresses for global forwarding rules and regional IP addresses
    for regional forwarding rules); an internal forwarding rule is
    automatically assigned an ephemeral internal IP address from the subnet
    specified with the --subnet flag. You must provide an IP address for an
    internal self-managed forwarding rule.

    Different types of load balancers work at different layers of the OSI
    networking model (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer). Layer 3/4
    targets include target pools, target SSL proxies, target TCP proxies, and
    backend services. Layer 7 targets include target HTTP proxies and target
    HTTPS proxies. For more information, refer to
    https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts.

    When creating a forwarding rule, exactly one of --target-instance,
    --target-pool, --target-http-proxy, --target-https-proxy,
    --target-grpc-proxy, --target-ssl-proxy, --target-tcp-proxy,
    --target-vpn-gateway, --backend-service or --target-google-apis-bundle must
    be specified.

EXAMPLES
    To create a global forwarding rule that will forward all traffic on port
    8080 for IP address ADDRESS to a target http proxy PROXY, run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules create RULE_NAME --global \
            --target-http-proxy=PROXY --ports=8080 --address=ADDRESS

    To create a regional forwarding rule for the subnet SUBNET_NAME on the
    default network that will forward all traffic on ports 80-82 to a backend
    service SERVICE_NAME, run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules create RULE_NAME \
            --load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL \
            --backend-service=SERVICE_NAME --subnet=SUBNET_NAME \
            --network=default --region=REGION --ports=80-82

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the forwarding rule to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE
          Target backend service that receives the traffic.

       --target-google-apis-bundle=TARGET_GOOGLE_APIS_BUNDLE
          Target bundle of Google APIs that will receive forwarded traffic via
          Private Service Connect. Acceptable values are all-apis, meaning all
          Google APIs, or vpc-sc, meaning just the APIs that support VPC
          Service Controls

       --target-grpc-proxy=TARGET_GRPC_PROXY
          Target gRPC proxy that receives the traffic.

       --target-http-proxy=TARGET_HTTP_PROXY
          Target HTTP proxy that receives the traffic. Acceptable values for
          --ports flag are: 80, 8080.

       --target-https-proxy=TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY
          Target HTTPS proxy that receives the traffic. Acceptable values for
          --ports flag are: 443.

       --target-instance=TARGET_INSTANCE
          Name of the target instance that receives the traffic. The target
          instance must be in a zone in the forwarding rule's region. Global
          forwarding rules cannot direct traffic to target instances. If not
          specified and the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be
          prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

       --target-pool=TARGET_POOL
          Target pool that receives the traffic. The target pool must be in the
          same region as the forwarding rule. Global forwarding rules cannot
          direct traffic to target pools.

       --target-service-attachment=TARGET_SERVICE_ATTACHMENT
          Target service attachment that receives the traffic. The target
          service attachment must be in the same region as the forwarding rule.

       --target-ssl-proxy=TARGET_SSL_PROXY
          Target SSL proxy that receives the traffic. For the acceptable ports,
          see Port specifications
          (https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications).

       --target-tcp-proxy=TARGET_TCP_PROXY
          Target TCP proxy that receives the traffic. For the acceptable ports,
          see Port specifications
          (https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications).

       --target-vpn-gateway=TARGET_VPN_GATEWAY
          Target VPN gateway (Cloud VPN Classic gateway) that receives
          forwarded traffic. Acceptable values for --ports flag are: 500, 4500.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --address=ADDRESS
        The IP address that the forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
        traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
        the target that you specify in the forwarding rule.

        If you don't specify a reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is
        assigned. You can specify the IP address as a literal IP address or as
        a reference to an existing Address resource. The following examples are
        all valid:
        ◆ 100.1.2.3
        ◆ 2600:1901::/96
        ◆ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project-1/regions/us-central1/addresses/address-1
        ◆ projects/project-1/regions/us-central1/addresses/address-1
        ◆ regions/us-central1/addresses/address-1
        ◆ global/addresses/address-1
        ◆ address-1

        The load-balancing-scheme (EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL,
        INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, INTERNAL_MANAGED) and the target of the
        forwarding rule determine the type of IP address that you can use. The
        address type must be external for load-balancing-scheme EXTERNAL or
        EXTERNAL_MANAGED. For other load-balancing-schemes, the address type
        must be internal. For detailed information, refer to
        https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications.

     --allow-global-access
        If True, then clients from all regions can access this internal
        forwarding rule. This can only be specified for forwarding rules with
        the LOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME set to INTERNAL or INTERNAL_MANAGED. For
        forwarding rules of type INTERNAL, the target must be either a backend
        service or a target instance.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Optional textual description for the forwarding rule.

     --disable-automate-dns-zone
        If specified, then a DNS zone will not be auto-generated for this
        Private Service Connect forwarding rule. This can only be specified if
        the forwarding rule's target is a service attachment
        (--target-service-attachment=SERVICE_ATTACHMENT) or Google APIs bundle
        (--target-google-apis-bundle=API_BUNDLE)

     --ip-protocol=IP_PROTOCOL
        IP protocol that the rule will serve. The default is TCP.

        Note that if the load-balancing scheme is INTERNAL, the protocol must
        be one of: TCP, UDP, L3_DEFAULT.

        For a load-balancing scheme that is EXTERNAL, all IP_PROTOCOL options
        are valid.

        IP_PROTOCOL must be one of: AH, ESP, ICMP, SCTP, TCP, UDP, L3_DEFAULT.

     --ip-version=IP_VERSION
        Version of the IP address to be allocated or assigned. The default is
        IPv4. IP_VERSION must be one of: IPV4, IPV6.

     --is-mirroring-collector
        If set, this forwarding rule can be used as a collector for packet
        mirroring. This can only be specified for forwarding rules with the
        LOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME set to INTERNAL.

     --load-balancing-scheme=LOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME
        This defines the forwarding rule's load balancing scheme. Note that it
        defaults to EXTERNAL and is not applicable for Private Service Connect
        forwarding rules. LOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME must be one of:

         EXTERNAL
            External load balancing or forwarding, used with one of
            --target-http-proxy, --target-https-proxy, --target-tcp-proxy,

        --load-balancing-scheme=EXTERNAL_MANAGED (regional) or
        --load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL_MANAGED) Network that this forwarding
        rule applies to. If this field is not specified, the default network is
        used. In the absence of the default network, this field must be
        specified.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Network tier to assign to the forwarding rules. NETWORK_TIER must be
        one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD, FIXED_STANDARD. The default value is
        PREMIUM.

     --service-directory-registration=SERVICE_DIRECTORY_REGISTRATION

        https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/dns-names/ The DNS label
        to use as the prefix of the fully qualified domain name for this
        forwarding rule. The full name will be internally generated and output
        as dnsName. If this field is not specified, no DNS record will be
        generated and no DNS name will be output. You cannot use the
        --service-label flag if the forwarding rule references an internal IP
        address that has the --purpose=SHARED_LOADBALANCER_VIP flag set.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        (Only for --load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL and
        --load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL_MANAGED) Subnetwork that this
