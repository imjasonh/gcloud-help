NAME
    gcloud compute config-ssh - populate SSH config files with Host entries
        from each instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute config-ssh [--dry-run] [--force-key-file-overwrite]
        [--remove] [--ssh-config-file=SSH_CONFIG_FILE]
        [--ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute config-ssh makes SSHing to virtual machine instances easier
    by adding an alias for each instance to the user SSH configuration
    (~/.ssh/config) file.

    In most cases, it is sufficient to run:

        $ gcloud compute config-ssh

    Each instance will be given an alias of the form NAME.ZONE.PROJECT. For
    example, if example-instance resides in us-central1-a, you can SSH to it by
    running:

        $ ssh example-instance.us-central1-a.MY-PROJECT

    On some platforms, the host alias can be tab-completed, making the long
    alias less daunting to type.

    The aliases created interface with SSH-based programs like scp(1), so it is
    possible to use the aliases elsewhere:

        $ scp ~/MY-FILE example-instance.us-central1-a.MY-PROJECT:~

    Whenever instances are added, removed, or their external IP addresses are
    changed, this command should be re-executed to update the configuration.

    This command ensures that the user's public SSH key is present in the
    project's metadata. If the user does not have a public SSH key, one is
    generated using ssh-keygen(1) (if the --quiet flag is given, the generated
    key will have an empty passphrase).

EXAMPLES
    To populate SSH config file with Host entries from each running instance,
    run:

        $ gcloud compute config-ssh

    To remove the change to the SSH config file by this command, run:

        $ gcloud compute config-ssh --remove

FLAGS
     --dry-run
        If provided, the proposed changes to the SSH config file are printed to
        standard output and no actual changes are made.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled, the gcloud command-line tool will regenerate and overwrite
        the files associated with a broken SSH key without asking for
        confirmation in both interactive and non-interactive environments.

        If disabled, the files associated with a broken SSH key will not be
        regenerated and will fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environments.

     --remove
        If provided, any changes made to the SSH config file by this tool are
        reverted.

     --ssh-config-file=SSH_CONFIG_FILE
        Specifies an alternative per-user SSH configuration file. By default,
        this is ~/.ssh/config.

     --ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
