SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-target-pools NAME
        --target-pools=[TARGET_POOL,...] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-target-pools sets the target
    pools for an existing managed instance group. Instances that are part of
    the managed instance group will be added to the target pool automatically.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --target-pools=[TARGET_POOL,...]
        Compute Engine Target Pools to add the instances to. Target Pools must
        be specified by name or by URL. Example:
        --target-pools=target-pool-1,target-pool-2. To clear the set of Target
        Pools pass in an empty list. Example: --target-pools=""

OPTIONAL FLAGS

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.
