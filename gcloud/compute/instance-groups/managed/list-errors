NAME
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed list-errors - list errors produced
        by managed instances in a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed list-errors NAME
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed list-errors List errors that are
    produced by managed instances in a managed instance group.

    The required permission to execute this command is
    compute.instanceGroupManagers.list. If needed, you can include this
    permission in a custom IAM role, or choose any of the following preexisting
    IAM roles that contain this particular permission:

      ▪ Compute Admin
      ▪ Compute Viewer
      ▪ Compute Instance Admin (v1)
      ▪ Compute Instance Admin (beta)
      ▪ Compute Network Admin
      ▪ Editor
      ▪ Owner
      ▪ Security Reviewer
      ▪ Viewer

    For more information regarding permissions required by managed instance
    groups, refer to Compute Engine's access control guide:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam#managed-instance-groups-and-iam.

EXAMPLES
    To list errors on managed instance group 'my-group', run:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed list-errors my-group \
          --format=yaml

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed list-errors

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed list-errors
