POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        Names of instances to stop.

OPTIONAL FLAGS

          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list
