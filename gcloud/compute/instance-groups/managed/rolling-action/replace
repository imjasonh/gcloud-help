NAME
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed rolling-action replace - replaces
        instances in a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed rolling-action replace NAME
        [--max-surge=MAX_SURGE] [--max-unavailable=MAX_UNAVAILABLE]
        [--replacement-method=REPLACEMENT_METHOD]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Deletes the existing instance and creates a new instance from the target
    template. The Updater creates a brand new instance with all new instance
    properties, such as new internal and external IP addresses.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --max-surge=MAX_SURGE
        Maximum additional number of instances that can be created during the
        update process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of
        size to the managed instance group (e.g. 10%). Defaults to 0 if the
        managed instance group has stateful configuration, or to the number of
        zones in which it operates otherwise.

     --max-unavailable=MAX_UNAVAILABLE
        Maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during the update
        process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of size to
        the managed instance group (e.g. 10%). Defaults to the number of zones
        in which the managed instance group operates.

     --replacement-method=REPLACEMENT_METHOD
        Type of replacement method. Specifies what action will be taken to
        update instances. Defaults to ``recreate`` if the managed instance
        group has stateful configuration, or to ``substitute`` otherwise.
        REPLACEMENT_METHOD must be one of:

         recreate
            Recreate instances and preserve the instance names. The instance
            IDs and creation timestamps might change.
         substitute
            Delete old instances and create instances with new names.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
