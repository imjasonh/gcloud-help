NAME
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed create-instance - create a new
        virtual machine instance in a managed instance group with a defined
        name and optionally its stateful configuration

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed create-instance NAME
        --instance=INSTANCE
        [--stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],
          [device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[source=SOURCE]]
        [--stateful-metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed create-instance creates a virtual
    machine instance with a defined name and optionally its stateful
    configuration: stateful disk and stateful metadata key-values. Stateful
    configuration is stored in the corresponding newly created per-instance
    config. An instance with a per-instance config will preserve its given
    name, specified disks, and specified metadata key-values during instance
    recreation, auto-healing, updates, and any other lifecycle transitions of
    the instance.

EXAMPLES
    To create an instance instance-1 in my-group (in region europe-west4) with
    metadata my-key: my-value and a disk disk-1 attached to it as the device
    device-1, run:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed create-instance my-group \
          --region=europe-west4 --instance=instance-1 \
          --stateful-disk='device-name=foo,source=https://compute.googleap\
        is.com/compute/alpha/projects/my-project/zones/europe-west4/disks/di\
        sk-1,mode=rw,auto-delete=on-permanent-instance-deletion' \
            --stateful-metadata='my-key=my-value'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to create instance in.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instance=INSTANCE
        Name of the new instance to create.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[source=SOURCE]
        Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Managed instance
        groups preserve and reattach stateful disks on VM autohealing, update,
        and recreate events.

        You can also attach and preserve disks, not defined in the group's
        instance template, to a given instance.

        The same disk can be attached to more than one instance but only in
        read-only mode.

     --stateful-metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Additional metadata to be made available to the guest operating system
        in addition to the metadata defined in the instance template.

        Stateful metadata may be used to define a key/value pair specific for
        the one given instance to differentiate it from the other instances in
        the managed instance group.

        Stateful metadata key/value pairs are preserved on instance recreation,
        autohealing, updates, and any other lifecycle transitions of the
        instance.

        Stateful metadata have priority over the metadata defined in the
        instance template. This means that stateful metadata that is defined
        for a key that already exists in the instance template overrides the
        instance template value.

        Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an equals sign.
        Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in length.
        Multiple entries can be passed to this flag, e.g., --stateful-metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to create instance in. If not
          specified, you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode
          only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to create instance in. If not
          specified, you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode
          only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.
