DESCRIPTION
    Update a Compute Engine managed instance group.

    gcloud compute instance-groups managed update allows you to specify or
    modify the description and group policies for an existing managed instance
    group, including the group's update policy and optional autohealing and
    stateful policies

    The group's update policy defines how an updated VM configuration is
    applied to existing VMs in the group. For more information, see [Applying
    new configurations]
    (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/updating-migs) to
    VMs in a MIG.

    A stateful policy defines which resources should be preserved across the
    group. When instances in the group are recreated, stateful resources are
    preserved. This command allows you to update stateful resources,
    specifically to add or remove stateful disks.

    When updating the autohealing policy, you can specify the health check,
    initial delay, or both. If either field is unspecified, its value won't be
    modified. If --health-check is specified, the health check monitors the
    health of your application. Whenever the health check signal for an
    instance becomes UNHEALTHY, the autohealer recreates the instance.

    If no health check exists, instance autohealing is triggered only by
    instance status: if an instance is not RUNNING, the group recreates it.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to update.

FLAGS
     --default-action-on-vm-failure=ACTION_ON_VM_FAILURE
        Specifies the action that a MIG performs on a failed or an unhealthy
        VM. A VM is marked as unhealthy when the application running on that VM
        fails a health check. By default, the value of the flag is set to
        repair. ACTION_ON_VM_FAILURE must be one of:

         do-nothing
            MIG does not repair a failed or an unhealthy VM.
         repair
            MIG automatically repairs a failed or an unhealthy VM.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description for this group. To clear the description, set
        the value to an empty string.

     --[no-]force-update-on-repair
        Specifies whether to apply the group's latest configuration when
        repairing a VM. If you updated the group's instance template or
        per-instance configurations after the VM was created, then these
        changes are applied when VM is repaired. If this flag is disabled with
        -no-force-update-on-repair, then updates are applied in accordance with
        the group's update policy type. By default, this flag is disabled. Use
        --force-update-on-repair to enable and --no-force-update-on-repair to
        disable.

     --instance-redistribution-type=TYPE
        Specifies the type of the instance redistribution policy. An instance
        redistribution type lets you enable or disable automatic instance
        redistribution across zones to meet the group's target distribution
        shape.

        An instance redistribution type can be specified only for a
        non-autoscaled regional managed instance group. By default it is set to
        proactive.

        TYPE must be one of:

         none
            The managed instance group does not redistribute instances across
            zones.
         proactive
            The managed instance group proactively redistributes instances to
            meet its target distribution.

     --list-managed-instances-results=MODE
        Pagination behavior for the group's listManagedInstances API method.
        This flag does not affect the group's gcloud or console list-instances
        behavior. By default it is set to pageless. MODE must be one of:

         pageless
            Pagination is disabled for the group's listManagedInstances API
            method. maxResults and pageToken query parameters are ignored and
            all instances are returned in a single response.
         paginated
            Pagination is enabled for the group's listManagedInstances API
            method. maxResults and pageToken query parameters are respected.

     --remove-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]
        Remove stateful configuration for the specified disks.

     --remove-stateful-external-ips=INTERFACE_NAME,[...]
        Remove stateful configuration for the specified interfaces for external
        IPs.

     --remove-stateful-internal-ips=INTERFACE_NAME,[...]
        Remove stateful configuration for the specified interfaces for internal
        IPs.

     --stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME]
        Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Managed instance
        groups preserve and reattach stateful disks on VM autohealing, update,
        and recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to update more disks.

        If a stateful disk with the given device name already exists in the
        current instance configuration, its properties will be replaced by the
        newly provided ones. Otherwise, a new stateful disk definition will be
        added to the instance configuration.

         device-name
            (Required) Device name of the disk to mark stateful.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Specifies the auto deletion policy of the stateful disk.
            The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete this disk. Instead, detach the
              disk when its instance is deleted.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the stateful disk when
              the instance that it's attached to is permanently deleted from
              the group; for example, when the instance is deleted manually or
              when the group size is decreased.

     --stateful-external-ip=[enabled],[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]
        Managed instance groups preserve stateful IPs on VM autohealing,
        update, and recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to update more IPs.

        If a stateful external IP with the given interface name already exists
        in the current instance configuration, its properties are replaced by
        the newly provided ones. Otherwise, a new stateful external IP
        definition is added to the instance configuration.

        At least one of the following is required:

         enabled
            Marks the IP address as stateful. The network interface named nic0
            is assumed by default when interface-name is not specified. This
            flag can be omitted when interface-name is provided explicitly.

         interface-name
            Marks the IP address from this network interface as stateful. This
            flag can be omitted when enabled is provided.

            Additional arguments:

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Prescribes what should happen to an associated static
            Address resource when a VM instance is permanently deleted.
            Regardless of the value of the delete rule, stateful IP addresses
            are always preserved on instance autohealing, update, and
            recreation operations. The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete the static IP address. Instead,
              unassign the address when its instance is permanently deleted and
              keep the address reserved.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the static IP address
              reservation when the instance that it's assigned to is
              permanently deleted from the instance group; for example, when
              the instance is deleted manually or when the group size is
              decreased.

     --stateful-internal-ip=[enabled],[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[interface-name=INTERFACE-NAME]
        Managed instance groups preserve stateful IPs on VM autohealing,
        update, and recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to update more IPs.

        If a stateful internal IP with the given interface name already exists
        in the current instance configuration, its properties are replaced by
        the newly provided ones. Otherwise, a new stateful internal IP
        definition is added to the instance configuration.

        At least one of the following is required:

         enabled
            Marks the IP address as stateful. The network interface named nic0
            is assumed by default when interface-name is not specified. This
            flag can be omitted when interface-name is provided explicitly.

         interface-name
            Marks the IP address from this network interface as stateful. This
            flag can be omitted when enabled is provided.

            Additional arguments:

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Prescribes what should happen to an associated static
            Address resource when a VM instance is permanently deleted.
            Regardless of the value of the delete rule, stateful IP addresses
            are always preserved on instance autohealing, update, and
            recreation operations. The following options are available:
            ▸ never: (Default) Never delete the static IP address. Instead,
              unassign the address when its instance is permanently deleted and
              keep the address reserved.
            ▸ on-permanent-instance-deletion: Delete the static IP address
              reservation when the instance that it's assigned to is
              permanently deleted from the instance group; for example, when
              the instance is deleted manually or when the group size is
              decreased.

     --target-distribution-shape=SHAPE
        Specifies how a regional managed instance group distributes its
        instances across zones within the region. The default shape is even.
        SHAPE must be one of:

         any
            The group picks zones for creating VM instances to fulfill the
            requested number of VMs within present resource constraints and to
            maximize utilization of unused zonal reservations. Recommended for
            batch workloads that do not require high availability.
         any-single-zone
            The group schedules all instances within a single zone. The zone is
            chosen based on hardware support, current resources availability,
            and matching reservations. The group might not be able to create
            the requested number of VMs in case of zonal resource availability
            constraints. Recommended for workloads requiring extensive
            communication between VMs.
         balanced
            The group prioritizes acquisition of resources, scheduling VMs in
            zones where resources are available while distributing VMs as
            evenly as possible across selected zones to minimize the impact of
            zonal failure. Recommended for highly available serving or batch
            workloads that do not require autoscaling.
         even
            The group schedules VM instance creation and deletion to achieve
            and maintain an even number of managed instances across the
            selected zones. The distribution is even when the number of managed
            instances does not differ by more than 1 between any two zones.
            Recommended for highly available serving workloads.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-autohealing
          Clears all autohealing policy fields for the managed instance group.

       --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY
          Specifies the number of seconds that a new VM takes to initialize and
          run its startup script. During a VM's initial delay period, the MIG
          ignores unsuccessful health checks because the VM might be in the
          startup process. This prevents the MIG from prematurely recreating a
          VM. If the health check receives a healthy response during the
          initial delay, it indicates that the startup process is complete and
          the VM is ready. The value of initial delay must be between 0 and
          3600 seconds. The default value is 0. See $ gcloud topic datetimes
          for information on duration formats.

       At most one of these can be specified:

         --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
            Name of the health check to operate on.

         --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
            (DEPRECATED) HTTP health check object used for autohealing
            instances in this group.

            HttpHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

         --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK
            (DEPRECATED) HTTPS health check object used for autohealing
            instances in this group.

            HttpsHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

     Parameters for setting update policy for this managed instance group.

       --update-policy-max-surge=MAX_SURGE
          Maximum additional number of VMs that can be created during the
          update process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage
          of size to the managed instance group (e.g. 10%).

       --update-policy-max-unavailable=MAX_UNAVAILABLE
          Maximum number of VMs that can be unavailable during the update
          process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of size
          to the managed instance group (e.g. 10%). Defaults to the number of
          zones in which the managed instance group operates.

       --update-policy-minimal-action=UPDATE_POLICY_MINIMAL_ACTION
          Use this flag to minimize disruption as much as possible or to apply
          a more disruptive action than is strictly necessary. The MIG performs
          at least this action on each VM while updating. If the update
          requires a more disruptive action than the one specified here, then
          the more disruptive action is performed. UPDATE_POLICY_MINIMAL_ACTION
          must be one of:

           none
              No action
           refresh
              Apply the new configuration without stopping VMs, if possible.
              For example, use ``refresh`` to apply changes that only affect
              metadata or additional disks.
           restart
              Apply the new configuration without replacing VMs, if possible.
              For example, stopping VMs and starting them again is sufficient
              to apply changes to machine type.
           replace
              Replace old VMs according to the
              --update-policy-replacement-method flag.

       --update-policy-most-disruptive-action=UPDATE_POLICY_MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ACTION
          Use this flag to prevent an update if it requires more disruption
          than you can afford. At most, the MIG performs the specified action
          on each VM while updating. If the update requires a more disruptive
          action than the one specified here, then the update fails and no
          changes are made. UPDATE_POLICY_MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ACTION must be one
          of:

           none
              No action
           refresh
              Apply the new configuration without stopping VMs, if possible.
              For example, use ``refresh`` to apply changes that only affect
              metadata or additional disks.
           restart
              Apply the new configuration without replacing VMs, if possible.
              For example, stopping VMs and starting them again is sufficient
              to apply changes to machine type.
           replace
              Replace old VMs according to the
              --update-policy-replacement-method flag.

       --update-policy-replacement-method=UPDATE_POLICY_REPLACEMENT_METHOD
          Type of replacement method. Specifies what action will be taken to
          update VMs. UPDATE_POLICY_REPLACEMENT_METHOD must be one of:

           recreate
              Recreate VMs and preserve the VM names. The VM IDs and creation
              timestamps might change.
           substitute
              Delete old VMs and create VMs with new names.

       --update-policy-type=UPDATE_TYPE
          Specifies the type of update process. You can specify either
          ``proactive`` so that the managed instance group proactively executes
          actions in order to bring VMs to their target versions or
          ``opportunistic`` so that no action is proactively executed but the
          update will be performed as part of other actions. UPDATE_TYPE must
          be one of:

           opportunistic
              Do not proactively replace VMs. Create new VMs and delete old
              ones on resizes of the group and when you target specific VMs to
              be updated or recreated.
           proactive
              Replace VMs proactively.
