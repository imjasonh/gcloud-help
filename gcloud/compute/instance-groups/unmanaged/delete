NAME
    gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged delete - delete Compute Engine
        unmanaged instance groups

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged delete deletes one or more Compute
    Engine unmanaged instance groups. This command just deletes the instance
    group and does not delete the individual virtual machine instances in the
    instance group. For example:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged delete \
            example-instance-group-1 example-instance-group-2 \
            --zone us-central1-a

    The above example deletes two instance groups, example-instance-group-1 and
    example-instance-group-2, in the us-central1-a zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the instance groups to delete.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance groups to delete. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
