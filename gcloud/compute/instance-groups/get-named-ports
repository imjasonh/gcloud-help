NAME
    gcloud compute instance-groups get-named-ports - lists the named ports for
        an instance group resource

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instance-groups get-named-ports NAME
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Named ports are key:value pairs metadata representing the service name and
    the port that it's running on. Named ports can be assigned to an instance
    group, which indicates that the service is available on all instances in
    the group. This information is used by the HTTP Load Balancing service.

    gcloud compute instance-groups get-named-ports lists the named ports (name
    and port tuples) for an instance group.

EXAMPLES
    For example, to list named ports for an instance group:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups get-named-ports \
            example-instance-group --zone=us-central1-a

    The above example lists named ports assigned to an instance group named
    'example-instance-group' in the us-central1-a zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the instance group to operate on. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the instance group to operate on. If not specified, you might
          be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change
        the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with
        --format, the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs
        alongside other keys instead, use the uri() transform.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups get-named-ports

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups get-named-ports
