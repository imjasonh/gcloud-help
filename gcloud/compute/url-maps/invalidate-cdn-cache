NAME
    gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache - invalidate specified objects
        for a URL map in Cloud CDN caches

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache URLMAP [--async] [--global]
        [--host=HOST] [--path=PATH] [--tags=TAGS] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache requests that Cloud CDN stop
    using cached content for resources at a particular URL path or set of URL
    paths.

    gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache may succeed even if no content
    is cached for some or all URLs with the given path.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URLMAP
        Name of the URL map to operate on.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --global
        (Default) The URL map is global. Regional URL maps are not supported.

     --host=HOST
        If set, this invalidation will apply only to requests to the specified
        host.

     --path=PATH
        A path specifying which objects to invalidate. PATH must start with
        ``/'' and the only place a ``*'' is allowed is at the end following a
        ``/''. It will be matched against URL paths, which do not include
        scheme, host, or any text after the first ``?'' or ``#'' (and those
        characters are not allowed here). For example, for the URL
        https://example.com/whatever/x.html?a=b, the path is /whatever/x.html.

        If PATH ends with ``*'', the preceding string is a prefix, and all URLs
        whose paths begin with it will be invalidated. If PATH doesn't end with
        ``*'', then only URLs with exactly that path will be invalidated.

        Examples:
        ◆ ``'', ``*'', anything that doesn't start with ``/'': error
        ◆ ``/'': just the root URL
        ◆ ``/*'': everything
        ◆ ``/x/y'': ``/x/y'' only (and not ``/x/y/'')
        ◆ ``/x/y/'': ``/x/y/'' only (and not ``/x/y'')
        ◆ ``/x/y/*'': ``/x/y/'' and everything under it

     --tags=TAGS
        A single tag or a comma-delimited list of tags. When multiple tags are
        specified, the invalidation applies them using boolean OR logic.

        Example:
        ◆ --tags=abcd,user123
