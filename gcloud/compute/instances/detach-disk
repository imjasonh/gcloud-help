NAME
    gcloud compute instances detach-disk - detach disks from Compute Engine
        virtual machine instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instances detach-disk INSTANCE_NAME
        (--device-name=DEVICE_NAME | --disk=DISK)
        [--disk-scope=DISK_SCOPE; default="zonal"] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instances detach-disk is used to detach disks from virtual
    machines.

    Detaching a disk without first unmounting it may result in incomplete I/O
    operations and data corruption. To unmount a persistent disk on a
    Linux-based image, ssh into the instance and run:

        $ sudo umount /dev/disk/by-id/google-DEVICE_NAME

EXAMPLES
    To detach a disk named 'my-disk' from an instance named 'my-instance', run:

        $ gcloud compute instances detach-disk my-instance --disk=my-disk

    To detach a device named 'my-device' from an instance named 'my-instance',
    run:

        $ gcloud compute instances detach-disk my-instance \
            --device-name=my-device

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --device-name=DEVICE_NAME
          Specifies a disk to detach by its device name, which is the name that
          the guest operating system sees. The device name is set at the time
          that the disk is attached to the instance, and needs not be the same
          as the persistent disk name. If the disk's device name is specified,
          then its persistent disk name must not be specified using the --disk
          flag.

       --disk=DISK
          Specifies a disk to detach by its resource name. If you specify a
          disk to remove by persistent disk name, then you must not specify its
          device name using the --device-name flag.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --disk-scope=DISK_SCOPE; default="zonal"
        The scope of the disk. DISK_SCOPE must be one of:

         regional
            The disk specified in --disk is interpreted as a regional disk in
            the same region as the instance. Ignored if a full URI is provided
            to the --disk flag.
         zonal
            The disk specified in --disk is interpreted as a zonal disk in the
            same zone as the instance. Ignored if a full URI is provided to the
            --disk flag.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
