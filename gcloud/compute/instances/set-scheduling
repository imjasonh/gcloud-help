DESCRIPTION
    $gcloud compute instances set-scheduling is used to update scheduling
    options for VM instances. You can only call this method on a VM instance
    that is stopped (a VM instance in a TERMINATED state).

EXAMPLES
    To set instance to be terminated during maintenance, run:

        $ gcloud compute instances set-scheduling example-instance \
            --maintenance-policy=TERMINATE --zone=us-central1-b

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --clear-min-node-cpu
        Removes the min-node-cpu field from the instance. If specified, the
        instance min-node-cpu will be cleared. The instance will not be
        overcommitted and utilize the full CPU count assigned.

     --local-ssd-recovery-timeout=LOCAL_SSD_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT
        Specifies the maximum amount of time a Local Ssd Vm should wait while
        recovery of the Local Ssd state is attempted. Its value should be in
        between 0 and 168 hours with hour granularity and the default value
        being 1 hour.

     --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the VMs when their host machines undergo
        maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. For more information, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/host-maintenance-options.
        MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

         MIGRATE
            The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
            temporarily impact the performance of instances during a migration
            event.
         TERMINATE
            The instances should be terminated.

     --min-node-cpu=MIN_NODE_CPU
        Minimum number of virtual CPUs this instance will consume when running
        on a sole-tenant node.

     --[no-]preemptible
        If provided, instances will be preemptible and time-limited. Instances
        might be preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and
        will only be able to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible
        instances can not be restarted and will not migrate. Use --preemptible
        to enable and --no-preemptible to disable.

     --provisioning-model=PROVISIONING_MODEL
        Specifies provisioning model, which determines price, obtainability,
        and runtime for the VM instance. PROVISIONING_MODEL must be one of:

         SPOT
            Spot VMs are spare capacity; Spot VMs are discounted to have much
            lower prices than standard VMs but have no guaranteed runtime. Spot
            VMs are the new version of preemptible VM instances, except Spot
            VMs do not have a 24-hour maximum runtime.
         STANDARD
            Default. Standard provisioning model for VM instances, which has
            user-controlled runtime but no Spot discounts.

     --[no-]restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user. This
        option is mutually exclusive with --preemptible. Use
        --restart-on-failure to enable and --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Discard Local SSDs At Termination Timestamp

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-discard-local-ssds-at-termination-timestamp
          Removes the discard-local-ssds-at-termination-timestamp field from
          the scheduling options.

       --discard-local-ssds-at-termination-timestamp=DISCARD_LOCAL_SSDS_AT_TERMINATION_TIMESTAMP
          Required to be set to true and only allowed for VMs that have one or
          more local SSDs, use --instance-termination-action=STOP, and use
          either --max-run-duration or --termination-time.

          This flag indicates the value that you want Compute Engine to use for
          the --discard-local-ssd flag in the automatic gcloud compute
          instances stop command. This flag only supports the true value, which
          discards local SSD data when automatically stopping this VM during
          its terminationTimestamp.

          For more information about the --discard-local-ssd flag, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#stop_instance.

     Instance Termination Action

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-instance-termination-action
          Disables the termination action for this VM if allowed OR sets
          termination action to the default value. Depending on a VM's
          availability settings, a termination action is either required or not
          allowed. This flag is required when you are updating a VM such that
          it's previously specified termination action is no longer allowed. If
          you use this flag when a VM requires a termination action, it's
          termination action is just set to the default value (stop).

       --instance-termination-action=INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION
          Specifies the termination action that will be taken upon VM
          preemption (--provisioning-model=SPOT) or automatic instance
          termination (--max-run-duration or --termination-time).

          INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION must be one of:

           DELETE
              Permanently delete the VM.
           STOP
              Default only for Spot VMs. Stop the VM without preserving memory.
              The VM can be restarted later.

     Max Run Duration

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-run-duration
          Removes the max-run-duration field from the scheduling options.

       --max-run-duration=MAX_RUN_DURATION
          Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a duration
          relative to the last time when the VM began running. Format the
          duration, MAX_RUN_DURATION, as the number of days, hours, minutes,
          and seconds followed by d, h, m, and s respectively. For example,
          specify 30m for a duration of 30 minutes or specify 1d2h3m4s for a
          duration of 1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4 seconds. Alternatively,
          to specify a timestamp, use --termination-time instead.

          If neither --max-run-duration nor --termination-time is specified
          (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or
          system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to
          be automatically terminated at the VM's termination timestamp
          (terminationTimestamp) using the action specified by
          --instance-termination-action.

          Note: The terminationTimestamp is removed whenever the VM is stopped
          or suspended and redefined whenever the VM is rerun. For
          --max-run-duration specifically, the terminationTimestamp is the sum
          of MAX_RUN_DURATION and the time when the VM last entered the RUNNING
          state, which changes whenever the VM is rerun.

     Sole Tenancy.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-node-affinities
          Removes the node affinities field from the instance. If specified,
          the instance node settings will be cleared. The instance will not be
          scheduled onto a sole-tenant node.

       --node=NODE
          The name of the node to schedule this instance on.

       --node-affinity-file=NODE_AFFINITY_FILE
          The JSON/YAML file containing the configuration of desired nodes onto
          which this instance could be scheduled. These rules filter the nodes
          according to their node affinity labels. A node's affinity labels
          come from the node template of the group the node is in.

          The file should contain a list of a JSON/YAML objects. For an
          example, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/provisioning-sole-tenant-vms#configure_node_affinity_labels.
          The following list describes the fields:

           key
              Corresponds to the node affinity label keys of the Node resource.
           operator
              Specifies the node selection type. Must be one of: IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to seek for matched nodes. NOT_IN: Requires
              Compute Engine to avoid certain nodes.
           values
              Optional. A list of values which correspond to the node affinity
              label values of the Node resource.

       --node-group=NODE_GROUP
          The name of the node group to schedule this instance on.

     Termination Time

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-termination-time
          Removes the termination-time field from the scheduling options.

       --termination-time=TERMINATION_TIME
          Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a time. Format
          the time, TERMINATION_TIME, as a RFC 3339 timestamp. For more
          information, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339. Alternatively,
          to specify a duration, use --max-run-duration instead.

          If neither --termination-time nor --max-run-duration is specified
          (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or
          system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to
          be automatically terminated at the VM's termination timestamp
          (terminationTimestamp) using the action specified by
          --instance-termination-action.

          Note: The terminationTimestamp is removed whenever the VM is stopped
          or suspended and redefined whenever the VM is rerun. For
          --termination-time specifically, the terminationTimestamp remains the
          same whenever the VM is rerun, but any requests to rerun the VM fail
          if the specified timestamp is in the past.
