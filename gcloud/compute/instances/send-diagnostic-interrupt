NAME
    gcloud compute instances send-diagnostic-interrupt - send a diagnostic
        interrupt to a virtual machine instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instances send-diagnostic-interrupt INSTANCE_NAME
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instances send-diagnostic-interrupt is used to send a
    diagnostic interrupt to a running instance, which triggers special
    interrupt handling logic inside VM.

    For instances with Intel or AMD processors, the guest OS on the instance
    will receive a non-maskable interrupt (NMI).

EXAMPLES
    To send a diagnostic interrupt to an instance named test-instance, run:

        $ gcloud compute instances send-diagnostic-interrupt test-instance

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
