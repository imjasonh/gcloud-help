NAME
    gcloud compute instances suspend - suspend a virtual machine instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instances suspend INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        [--async] [--discard-local-ssd[=DISCARD_LOCAL_SSD]] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instances suspend is used to suspend a Compute Engine
    virtual machine. Suspending a VM is the equivalent of sleep or standby
    mode: the guest receives an ACPI S3 suspend signal, after which all VM
    state is saved to temporary storage. An instance can only be suspended
    while it is in the RUNNING state. A suspended instance will be put in
    SUSPENDED state.

    Note: A suspended instance can be resumed by running the gcloud compute
    instances resume command.

    If a VM has any attached Local SSD disks, you can preserve the Local SSD
    data when you suspend the VM by setting --discard-local-ssd=False.
    Preserving the Local SSD disk data incurs costs and is subject to
    limitations.

    Limitations:

      ▪ Limitations for suspending a VM:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/suspend-resume-instance#limitations
      ▪ Limitations for preserving Local SSD data:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#stop_instance

EXAMPLES
    To suspend an instance named test-instance, run:

        $ gcloud compute instances suspend test-instance

    To suspend an instance named test-instance that has a Local SSD, run:

        $ gcloud compute instances suspend test-instance \
            --discard-local-ssd=True

    Using --discard-local-ssd without a value defaults to True.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --discard-local-ssd[=DISCARD_LOCAL_SSD]
        If set to true, local SSD data is discarded.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to operate on. If not specified, you might be
        prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to
        identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your
        currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud
        prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances suspend

        $ gcloud beta compute instances suspend
