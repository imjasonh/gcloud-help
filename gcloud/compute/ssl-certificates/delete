NAME
    gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete - delete Compute Engine SSL
        certificates

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete deletes one or more Compute Engine
    SSL certificate resources. SSL certificates can only be deleted when no
    other resources (for example, target HTTPS proxies) refer to them.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a certificate resource 'my-cert', run:

        $ gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete my-cert

    To delete certificate resources 'my-cert1', 'my-cert2' and 'my-cert3', run:

        $ gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete my-cert1 my-cert2 my-cert3

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the SSL certificates to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the SSL certificates are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the SSL certificates to delete. If not specified, you might
          be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates delete

        $ gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates delete
