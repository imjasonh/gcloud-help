SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute service-attachments delete NAME [NAME ...] [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete one or more Google Compute Engine service attachments.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a service attachment, run:

        $ gcloud compute service-attachments delete \
          SERVICE_ATTACHMENT_NAME --region=us-central1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the service attachments to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the service attachments to delete. If not specified, you
        might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.
