SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute network-firewall-policies associations delete

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute network-firewall-policies associations delete is used to
    delete network firewall policy associations. An network firewall policy is
    a set of rules that controls access to various resources.

EXAMPLES
    To delete an association from a global network firewall policy with NAME
    my-policy and association name my-association, run:

        $ gcloud compute network-firewall-policies associations delete \
            --firewall-policy=my-policy --name=my-association \
            --global-firewall-policy

    To delete an association from a regional network firewall policy with NAME
    my-policy in region region-a and association name my-association, run:

        $ gcloud compute network-firewall-policies associations delete \
            --firewall-policy=my-policy --name=my-association \
            --firewall-policy-region=region-a

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --firewall-policy=FIREWALL_POLICY
        Firewall policy ID with which to delete association.

     --name=NAME

          If set, the firewall policy is global.
