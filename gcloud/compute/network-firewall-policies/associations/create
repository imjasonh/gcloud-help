NAME
    gcloud compute network-firewall-policies associations create - create a new
        association between a firewall policy and a network

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute network-firewall-policies associations create
        --firewall-policy=FIREWALL_POLICY --network=NETWORK [--name=NAME]
        [--replace-association-on-target]
        [--firewall-policy-region=FIREWALL_POLICY_REGION
          | --global-firewall-policy] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute network-firewall-policies associations create is used to
    create network firewall policy associations. A network firewall policy is a
    set of rules that controls access to various resources.

EXAMPLES
    To associate a global network firewall policy with name my-policy to
    network my-network with an association named my-association, run:

        $ gcloud compute network-firewall-policies associations create \
            --firewall-policy=my-policy --network=my-network \
            --name=my-association --global-firewall-policy

    To associate a network firewall policy with name my-region-policy in region
    region-a to network my-network with an association named my-association,
    run:

        $ gcloud compute network-firewall-policies associations create \
            --firewall-policy=my-policy --network=my-network \
            --name=my-association --firewall-policy-region=region-a

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --firewall-policy=FIREWALL_POLICY
        Firewall policy ID with which to create association.

     --network=NETWORK
        Name of the network with which the association is created.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --name=NAME
        Name of the association.

     --replace-association-on-target
        By default, if you attempt to insert an association to a network that
        is already associated with a firewall policy the method will fail. If
        this is set, the existing association will be deleted at the same time
        that the new association is created.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --firewall-policy-region=FIREWALL_POLICY_REGION
          Region of the firewall policy to create. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

       --global-firewall-policy
          If set, the firewall policy is global.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute network-firewall-policies associations create

        $ gcloud beta compute network-firewall-policies associations create
