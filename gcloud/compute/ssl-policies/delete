NAME
    gcloud compute ssl-policies delete - delete Compute Engine SSL policies

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute ssl-policies delete SSL_POLICY [SSL_POLICY ...]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute ssl-policies delete is used to delete one or more Compute
    Engine SSL policies. SSL policies can only be deleted when no other
    resources (e.g., Target HTTPS proxies, Target SSL proxies) refer to them.

    An SSL policy specifies the server-side support for SSL features. An SSL
    policy can be attached to a TargetHttpsProxy or a TargetSslProxy. This
    affects connections between clients and the load balancer. SSL policies do
    not affect the connection between the load balancers and the backends. SSL
    policies are used by Application Load Balancers and proxy Network Load
    Balancers.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SSL_POLICY [SSL_POLICY ...]
        Names of the SSL policies to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the SSL policies are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the SSL policies to delete. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
