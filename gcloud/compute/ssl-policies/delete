NAME
    gcloud compute ssl-policies delete - delete Compute Engine SSL policies

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute ssl-policies delete SSL_POLICY [SSL_POLICY ...]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute ssl-policies delete is used to delete one or more Compute
    Engine SSL policies. SSL policies can only be deleted when no other
    resources (e.g., Target HTTPS proxies, Target SSL proxies) refer to them.

    An SSL policy specifies the server-side support for SSL features. An SSL
    policy can be attached to a TargetHttpsProxy or a TargetSslProxy. This
    affects connections between clients and the HTTPS or SSL proxy load
    balancer. SSL policies do not affect the connection between the load
    balancers and the backends.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SSL_POLICY [SSL_POLICY ...]
        Names of the SSL policies to delete.
