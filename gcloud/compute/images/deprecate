NAME
    gcloud compute images deprecate - manage deprecation status of Compute
        Engine images

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute images deprecate IMAGE_NAME --state=STATE
        [--replacement=REPLACEMENT]
        [--delete-in=DELETE_IN | --delete-on=DELETE_ON]
        [--deprecate-in=DEPRECATE_IN | --deprecate-on=DEPRECATE_ON]
        [--obsolete-in=OBSOLETE_IN | --obsolete-on=OBSOLETE_ON]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute images deprecate is used to deprecate images.

EXAMPLES
    To deprecate an image called 'IMAGE' immediately, mark it as obsolete in
    one day, and mark it as deleted in two days, use:

        $ gcloud compute images deprecate IMAGE --state=DEPRECATED \
            --obsolete-in=1d --delete-in=2d

    To un-deprecate an image called 'IMAGE' and clear times for deprecated,
    obsoleted, and deleted, use:

        $ gcloud compute images deprecate IMAGE --state=ACTIVE

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_NAME
        Name of the disk image to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --state=STATE
        The deprecation state to set on the image. STATE must be one of:

         ACTIVE
            The image is currently supported.
         DELETED
            New uses result in an error. Setting this state will not
            automatically delete the image. You must still make a request to
            delete the image to remove it from the image list.
         DEPRECATED
            Operations which create a new DEPRECATED resource return
            successfully, but with a warning indicating that the image is
            deprecated and recommending its replacement.
         OBSOLETE
            New uses result in an error.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --replacement=REPLACEMENT
        Specifies a Compute Engine image as a replacement for the image being
        phased out. Users of the deprecated image will be advised to switch to
        this replacement. For example, --replacement example-image or
        --replacement projects/google/global/images/example-image.

        This flag value is purely informational and is not validated in any
        way.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --delete-in=DELETE_IN
          Specifies a time duration in which the image should be marked as
          DELETED.

          Note: This is only informational and the image will not be deleted
          unless you manually delete it.

          For example, specifying 30d sets the planned DELETED time to 30 days
          from the current system time, but does not delete the image. You must
          manually delete the image in 30 days. See $ gcloud topic datetimes
          for information on duration formats.

          This flag is mutually exclusive with --delete-on.

       --delete-on=DELETE_ON
          Specifies a date when the image should be marked as DELETED.

          Note: This is only informational and the image will not be deleted
          unless you manually delete it.

          This flag is mutually exclusive with --delete-in.

          The date and time specified must be valid RFC 3339 full-date or
          date-time. For times in UTC, this looks like YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
          For example: 2020-01-02T00:00:00Z for midnight on January 2, 2020 in
          UTC.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --deprecate-in=DEPRECATE_IN
          Specifies a time duration in which the image should be marked as
          DEPRECATED.

          Note: This is only informational and the image will not be deprecated
          unless you manually deprecate it.

          This flag is mutually exclusive with --deprecate-on.

          For example, specifying 30d sets the planned DEPRECATED date to 30
          days from the current system time, but does not deprecate the image.
          You must manually deprecate the image in 30 days. See $ gcloud topic
          datetimes for information on duration formats.

       --deprecate-on=DEPRECATE_ON
          Specifies a date when the image should be marked as DEPRECATED.

          Note: This is only informational and the image will not be deprecated
          unless you manually deprecate it.

          This flag is mutually exclusive with --deprecate-in.

          The date and time specified must be valid RFC 3339 full-date or
          date-time. For times in UTC, this looks like YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
          For example: 2020-01-02T00:00:00Z for midnight on January 2, 2020 in
          UTC.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --obsolete-in=OBSOLETE_IN
          Specifies a time duration in which the image should be marked as
          OBSOLETE.

          Note: This is only informational and the image will not be obsoleted
          unless you manually obsolete it.

          This flag is mutually exclusive with --obsolete-on.

          For example, specifying 30d sets the planned OBSOLETE time to 30 days
          from the current system time, but does not obsolete the image. You
          must manually obsolete the image in 30 days. See $ gcloud topic
          datetimes for information on duration formats.

       --obsolete-on=OBSOLETE_ON
          Specifies a date when the image should be marked as OBSOLETE.

          Note: This is only informational and the image will not be obsoleted
          unless you manually obsolete it.

          This flag is mutually exclusive with --obsolete-in.

          The date and time specified must be valid RFC 3339 full-date or
          date-time. For times in UTC, this looks like YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
          For example: 2020-01-02T00:00:00Z for midnight on January 2, 2020 in
          UTC.
