NAME
    gcloud compute os-config patch-deployments create - create a patch
        deployment for a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute os-config patch-deployments create PATCH_DEPLOYMENT_ID
        --file=FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute os-config patch-deployments create creates a patch
    deployment in a project from a specified file. A patch deployment triggers
    a patch job to run at specific time(s) according to a schedule, and applies
    instance filters and other patch configurations to the patch job at run
    time. Alternatively, to run a patch job on-demand, see $ gcloud compute
    os-config patch-jobs execute.

EXAMPLES
    To create a patch deployment patch-deployment-1 in the current project,
    run:

        $ gcloud compute os-config patch-deployments create \
          patch-deployment-1 --file=path_to_config_file

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PATCH_DEPLOYMENT_ID

        This name must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens,
        start with a letter, end with a number or a letter, be between 1-63
        characters, and unique within the project.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --file=FILE
        The JSON or YAML file with the patch deployment to create. For
        information about the patch deployment format, see
