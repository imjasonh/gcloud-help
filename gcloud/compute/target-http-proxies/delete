NAME
    gcloud compute target-http-proxies delete - delete target HTTP proxies

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute target-http-proxies delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute target-http-proxies delete deletes one or more target HTTP
    proxies.

EXAMPLES
    Delete a global target HTTP proxy by running:

        $ gcloud compute target-http-proxies delete PROXY_NAME

    Delete a regional target HTTP proxy by running:

        $ gcloud compute target-http-proxies delete PROXY_NAME \
            --region=REGION_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the target HTTP proxies to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --global
          If set, the target HTTP proxies are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the target HTTP proxies to delete. If not specified, you
          might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.
