        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Deletes a view on a bucket.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a view on a bucket, run:

        $ gcloud logging views delete my-view --bucket=my-bucket \
           --location=global

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     VIEW_ID
        ID of the view to delete.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --bucket=BUCKET
        ID of bucket

     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the bucket.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Billing account of the view to delete.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the view to delete.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the view to delete.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the view to delete.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.
