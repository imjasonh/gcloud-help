DESCRIPTION
    Add IAM policy binding to a log view.

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role 'roles/my-role' for the user
    'my-user@gmail.com' on my-view, run:

        $ gcloud logging views add-iam-policy-binding my-view \
            --member='user:my-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/my-role' \
            --bucket=my-bucket --location=global

    To add a binding with a condition, run:

        $ gcloud logging views add-iam-policy-binding my-view \
            --member='user:my-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/my-role' \
            --bucket=my-bucket --location=global \
            --condition=expression=[expression],title=[title],\
        description=[description]

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details about
    IAM policies and member types.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     VIEW_ID
        ID of the view that contains the IAM policy.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --bucket=BUCKET
        ID of the bucket that contains the view.

     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the bucket that contains the view.

     --member=PRINCIPAL
        The principal to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Some resources also accept the following special values:
        ◆ allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        ◆ allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Role name to assign to the principal. The role name is the complete
        path of a predefined role, such as roles/logging.viewer, or the role ID
        for a custom role, such as
        organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/logging.viewer.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Billing account of the view that contains the IAM policy.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the view that contains the IAM policy.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the view that contains the IAM policy.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the view that contains the IAM policy.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          A condition to include in the binding. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a basic role. Basic roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer. For more on conditions, refer to the
          conditions overview guide:
          https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview

          When using the --condition flag, include the following key-value
          pairs:

           expression
              (Required) Condition expression that evaluates to True or False.
              This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

              If the condition expression includes a comma, use a different
              delimiter to separate the key-value pairs. Specify the delimiter
              before listing the key-value pairs. For example, to specify a
              colon (:) as the delimiter, do the following:
              --condition=^:^title=TITLE:expression=EXPRESSION. For more
              information, see
              https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/escaping.

           title
              (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the
              expression.

           description
              (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

       --condition-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition. Use a full or
          relative path to a local file containing the value of condition.
