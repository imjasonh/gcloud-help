NAME
    gcloud logging scopes create - create a log scope

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud logging scopes create LOG_SCOPE_ID
        --resource-names=[RESOURCE_NAMES,...] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    After creating a log scope, you can use it to view logs in 1 or more
    resources.

EXAMPLES
    To create a log scope in a project, run:

        $ gcloud logging scopes create my-scope \
            --resource-names=projects/my-project

    To create a log scope in a project with a description, run:

        $ gcloud logging scopes create my-scope \
            --resource-names=projects/my-project --description="my
        custom log scope"

    To create a log scope that contains more than 1 resource, such as projects
    and views, run:

        $ gcloud logging scopes create my-scope \
            --resource-names=projects/my-project,projects/my-project2, \
            projects/my-project/locations/global/buckets/my-bucket/views/\
        my-view1, \
            projects/my-project/locations/global/buckets/my-bucket/views/\
        my-view2,

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     LOG_SCOPE_ID
        ID of the log scope to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --resource-names=[RESOURCE_NAMES,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource names in this log scope. It could be
        one or more parent resources or one or more views. A log scope can
        include a maximum of 50 projects and a maximum of 100 resources in
        total. For example, projects/[PROJECT_ID],
        projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID]

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A textual description for the log scope.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the log scope to create.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the log scope to create.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the log scope to create.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
