NAME
    gcloud logging scopes delete - delete a log scope

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud logging scopes delete LOG_SCOPE_ID
        [--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

EXAMPLES
    To delete a log scope, run:

        $ gcloud logging scopes delete my-scope

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     LOG_SCOPE_ID
        ID of the log scope to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the log scope to delete.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the log scope to delete.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the log scope to delete.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
