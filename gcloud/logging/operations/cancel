NAME
    gcloud logging operations cancel - cancel a long running operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud logging operations cancel OPERATION_ID --location=LOCATION
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Cancel a long running operation with given OPERATION_ID in given LOCATION.
    This operation can be a copy_log_entries operation which is scheduled
    before.

EXAMPLES
    To cancel an operation, run:

        $ gcloud logging operations cancel OPERATION_ID --location=LOCATION

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION_ID
        The Id of the operation.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the operation.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Billing account of the operation to cancel.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the operation to cancel.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the operation to cancel.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the operation to cancel.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
