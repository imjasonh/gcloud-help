NAME
    gcloud logging operations list - list long running operations

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud logging operations list --location=LOCATION
        --operation-filter=OPERATION_FILTER [--page-token=PAGE_TOKEN]
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Return a list of long running operations in the given LOCATION. The
    operations were scheduled by other gcloud commands.

    For example, a CopyLogEntries operation may be scheduled by the command:
    gcloud logging copy BUCKET_ID DESTINATION --location=LOCATION.

    The --operation-filter flag is required and must specify the request_type.
    Supported request types include but are not limited to: CopyLogEntries,
    CreateBucket and UpdateBucket.

    Additional supported filter expressions include: operation_start_time,
    operation_finish_time and operation_state. These can be combined with the
    case-sensitive keyword AND between them.

    For operation_start_time and operation_end_time, the operators >=, >, <=,
    and < are supported.

    Timestamps must be in either RFC3339 or ISO8601 formats. If the timestamp
    contains a time value, then it must be quoted. For examples:
    "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ", "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ", "YY-MM-DD",
    "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-0000", "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM+0000", "YYYY-MM-DD",
    YYYY-MM-DD, YY-MM-DD, etc.

    The operation_state filter expression can be used to filter for operations
    that are in a specific state. The value can be one of the following:
    SCHEDULED, WAITING_FOR_PRECONDITIONS, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILURE, CANCELLED,
    PENDING.

    For operation_state, the operators = and != are supported.

    Other filter options are not supported.

EXAMPLES
    To list CopyLogEntries operations, run:

        $ gcloud logging operations list --location=LOCATION \
          --operation-filter='request_type=CopyLogEntries'

    To list CopyLogEntries operations that started after a specified time, run:

        $ gcloud logging operations list --location=LOCATION \
          --operation-filter='request_type=CopyLogEntries AND
        operation_start_time>="2023-11-20T00:00:00Z"'

    To list CopyLogEntries operations that finished before a specified time,
    run:

        $ gcloud logging operations list --location=LOCATION \
          --operation-filter='request_type=CopyLogEntries AND
        operation_finish_time<="2023-11-20T00:00:00Z"'

    To list CopyLogEntries operations that completed successfully, run:

        $ gcloud logging operations list --location=LOCATION \
          --operation-filter='request_type=CopyLogEntries AND
        operation_state=SUCCESS'

    To list CopyLogEntries operations that have not failed, run:

        $ gcloud logging operations list --location=LOCATION \
          --operation-filter='request_type=CopyLogEntries AND
        operation_state!=FAILURE'

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the operations.

     --operation-filter=OPERATION_FILTER
        Filter expression that specifies the operations to return.

FLAGS
     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        The next_page_token value returned from a previous List request, if
        any.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Billing account of the operations to list.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the operations to list.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the operations to list.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project of the operations to list.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha logging operations list

        $ gcloud beta logging operations list
