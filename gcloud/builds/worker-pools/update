DESCRIPTION
    Update a worker pool used by Google Cloud Build.

EXAMPLES
    To change the machine type and disk size of workers in a worker pool named
    wp1, run:

        $ gcloud builds worker-pools update wp1 --region=us-central1       \
                      --worker-machine-type=e2-standard-2                 \
            --worker-disk-size=64GB

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     WORKER_POOL
        Unique identifier for the worker pool to update. This value should be
        1-63 characters, and valid characters are [a-z][0-9]-

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud region where the worker pool is updated. See
        https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/locations for available locations.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE
          File that contains updates to the configuration for the worker pool.
          See
          https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/worker-pool-config-file-schema
          for options.

       Command-line flags to configure the private pool:

         Configuration to be used for creating workers in the worker pool:

           --worker-disk-size=WORKER_DISK_SIZE
              Size of the disk attached to the worker.

              If not given, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.

           --worker-machine-type=WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE
              Compute Engine machine type for a worker pool.

              If unspecified, Cloud Build uses a standard machine type.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --public-egress
              If set, workers in the worker pool are created with an external
              IP address.

           --no-public-egress
              If set, workers in the worker pool are created without an
              external IP address.

              If the worker pool is within a VPC Service Control perimeter, use
              this flag.
