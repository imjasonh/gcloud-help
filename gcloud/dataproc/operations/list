NAME
    gcloud dataproc operations list - view the list of all operations

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud dataproc operations list [--cluster=CLUSTER] [--region=REGION]
        [--state-filter=STATE_FILTER] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE; default=100] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    View a list of operations in a project. An optional filter can be used to
    constrain the operations returned. Filters are case-sensitive and have the
    following syntax:

        field = value [AND [field = value]] ...

    where field is either of status.state or labels.[KEY], where [KEY] is a
    label key. value can be * to match all values. status.state is one of:
    PENDING, ACTIVE, DONE. Only the logical AND operator is supported;
    space-separated items are treated as having an implicit AND operator.

EXAMPLES
    To see the list of all operations in Dataproc's 'us-central1' region, run:

        $ gcloud dataproc operations list --region='us-central1'

    To see the list of all create cluster operations in Dataproc's 'global'
    region, run:

        $ gcloud dataproc operations list --region='global' \
            --filter='operationType = CREATE'

    To see the list of all active operations in a cluster named 'mycluster'
    located in Dataproc's 'global' region, run:

        $ gcloud dataproc operations list --region='global' \
            --filter='status.state = RUNNING AND
          clusterName = mycluster'

    To see a list of all pending operations with the label env=staging on
    cluster mycluster located in Dataproc's 'us-central1' region, run:

        $ gcloud dataproc operations list --region='us-central1' \
            --filter='status.state = PENDING
          AND labels.env = staging AND clusterName = mycluster'

FLAGS
     --cluster=CLUSTER
        Restrict to the operations of this Dataproc cluster. This flag is
        ignored when --filter is specified. The equivalent term in a --filter
        expression is: clusterName = myclustername

     --region=REGION
        Dataproc region to use. Each Dataproc region constitutes an independent
        resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into Compute
        Engine zones inside the region. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

     --state-filter=STATE_FILTER
        Filter by cluster state. This flag is ignored when --filter is
        specified. The equivalent term in a --filter expression is:
        status.state = ACTIVE. STATE_FILTER must be one of: active, inactive.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE; default=100
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is 100.
        Paging may be applied before or after --filter and --limit depending on
        the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha dataproc operations list

        $ gcloud beta dataproc operations list
