POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DataSharingWithGoogleSetting resource - Name of the resource The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.
     (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
     set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument data_sharing_with_google_setting on the command
        line with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       DATA_SHARING_WITH_GOOGLE_SETTING
          ID of the dataSharingWithGoogleSetting or fully qualified identifier
          for the dataSharingWithGoogleSetting.

          To set the data_sharing_with_google_setting attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument data_sharing_with_google_setting on the
            command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the dataSharingWithGoogleSetting resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument data_sharing_with_google_setting on the

          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --request-id=REQUEST_ID
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request
        ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
        ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
        guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
        the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
        request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
        request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.
        This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID
        is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
