DESCRIPTION
    Delete a loggingSetting

EXAMPLES
    To delete the loggingSetting, run:

        $ gcloud gemini logging-settings delete

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     LoggingSetting resource - Name of the resource. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument logging_setting on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       LOGGING_SETTING
          ID of the loggingSetting or fully qualified identifier for the
          loggingSetting.

          To set the logging_setting attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument logging_setting on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the loggingSetting resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument logging_setting on the command line with a
            fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --request-id=REQUEST_ID
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request
        ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
        ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
        guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
        the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
        request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
        request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.
        This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID
        is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
