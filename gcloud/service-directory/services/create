POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - The Service Directory service to create. The service id
     must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
     [a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be
     a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase
     letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this

     can be set in other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument service on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SERVICE
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service. To
          set the service attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument service on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The name of the region for the service. To set the location
          attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument service on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --namespace on the command line.

FLAGS
     --annotations=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Annotations for the service.

        Annotations take the form of key/value string pairs. Keys are composed
        of an optional prefix and a name segment, separated by a slash(/).
        Prefixes and names must be composed of alphanumeric characters, dashes,
        and dots. Names may also use underscores. There are no character
        restrictions on what may go into the value of an annotation. The entire
        dictionary is limited to 2000 characters, spread across all key-value
        pairs.
