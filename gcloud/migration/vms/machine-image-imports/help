NAME
    gcloud migration vms machine-image-imports - imports machine images to
        Google Compute Engine from Google Cloud Storage

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud migration vms machine-image-imports COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud migration vms machine-image-imports provides a more robust and
    better supported method for importing machine images to Google Compute
    Engine. Other image-related operations (for example, list) can be done
    using gcloud compute images, as usual.

    The commands use VM Migration API which supports importing of a machine
    image from a Google Cloud Storage file (gs://...) to a target project. VM
    Migration API must be enabled in your project.

    gcloud migration vms machine-image-imports create creates a machine Image
    Import resource with a nested Image Import Job resource. The Image Import
    Job resource tracks the machine image import progress. After the Image
    Import Job completes, successfully or otherwise, there's no further use for
    the Image Import resource.

    The machine image is imported to a Google Cloud Project, desginated by the
    Target Project resource. To get a list of Target Projects, run the gcloud
    alpha migration vms target-projects list command. Use the Google Cloud
    console to add target project resources. For information on adding target
    projects, see
    https://cloud.google.com/migrate/virtual-machines/docs/5.0/how-to/target-project.

    A project can support up to a certain number of Image Import resources per
    project. Hence it's recommended to delete an Image Import resource after
    the Image Import Job is complete to avoid reaching the Image Import
    resources limit. Deletion of Image Import resource does not affect the
    imported machine image. For more information about the image import
    resource, see
    https://cloud.google.com/migrate/virtual-machines/docs/5.0/migrate/image_import.

    These flags are available to all commands: --help.
