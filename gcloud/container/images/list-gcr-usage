NAME
    gcloud container images list-gcr-usage - list Container Registry usage

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud container images list-gcr-usage
        (--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID) [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    List Container Registry usage for all projects in the specified scope
    (project/organization/folder). Caller must have
    cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources permission on the requested scope and
    storage.objects.list permission on the Cloud Storage buckets used by
    Container Registry.

    The tool returns the following lists of usage states:

    ACTIVE: Container Registry usage has occurred in the last 30 days. The host
    location and project are not redirected.

    INACTIVE: No Container Registry usage has occurred in the last 30 days. The
    host location and project are not redirected.

    REDIRECTED: The project has been redirected to Artifact Registry but still
    has Container Registry Cloud Storage buckets. This project will continue to
    function after Container Registry is turned down and no further action is
    required. You can reduce costs by deleting the Container Registry Cloud
    Storage buckets.

    REDIRECTION_INCOMPLETE: Requests are redirected to Artifact Registry, but
    data is still being copied from Container Registry.

    LEGACY: Container Registry usage is unknown. This state is caused by legacy
    Container Registry projects that store container image metadata files in
    Cloud Storage buckets. For more information on legacy Container Registry
    projects, see
    https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/deprecations/feature-deprecations#container_image_metadata_storage_change.

EXAMPLES
    To list Container Registry usage in a project:

        $ gcloud container images list-gcr-usage --project=my-proj

    To list Container Registry usage in an organization:

        $ gcloud container images list-gcr-usage --organization=my-org

    To list Container Registry usage in a folder:

        $ gcloud container images list-gcr-usage --folder=my-folder

    To list all active Container Registry usage in an organization:

        $ gcloud container images list-gcr-usage --organization=my-org \
            --filter="usage=ACTIVE"

    To list all projects that aren't redirected yet:

        $ gcloud container images list-gcr-usage --organization=my-org \
            --filter="usage!=REDIRECTED"

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder ID.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization ID.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project ID.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
