NAME
    gcloud container node-pools delete - delete an existing node pool in a
        running cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud container node-pools delete NAME [--async] [--cluster=CLUSTER]
        [--location=LOCATION | --region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud container node-pools delete deletes a node pool from a Google
    Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. When you delete a node pool, GKE drains
    all the nodes in the node pool. The draining process involves GKE evicting
    Pods on each node in the node pool. Each node in a node pool is drained by
    evicting Pods with an allotted graceful termination period of MAX_POD.
    MAX_POD is the maximum terminationGracePeriodSeconds set on the Pods
    scheduled to the node with a cap of one hour.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the "node-pool-1" node pool from the cluster "sample-cluster",
    run:

        $ gcloud container node-pools delete node-pool-1 \
            --cluster=sample-cluster

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the node pool to delete.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --cluster=CLUSTER
        The cluster from which to delete the node pool. Overrides the default
        container/cluster property value for this command invocation.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --location=LOCATION
          Compute zone or region (e.g. us-central1-a or us-central1) for the
          cluster.

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.
