NAME
    gcloud container aws clusters get-credentials - get credentials of an
        Anthos cluster on AWS

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud container aws clusters get-credentials
        (CLUSTER : --location=LOCATION) [--private-endpoint]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Fetch credentials for a running Anthos cluster on AWS.

    This command updates a kubeconfig file with appropriate credentials and
    endpoint information to point kubectl at a specific cluster on AWS.

    By default, credentials are written to HOME/.kube/config. You can provide
    an alternate path by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable. If
    KUBECONFIG contains multiple paths, the first one is used.

    This command enables switching to a specific cluster, when working with
    multiple clusters. It can also be used to access a previously created
    cluster from a new workstation.

    By default, the command will configure kubectl to automatically refresh its
    credentials using the same identity as the gcloud command-line tool. If you
    are running kubectl as part of an application, it is recommended to use
    application default credentials
    (https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production). To configure a
    kubeconfig file to use application default credentials, set the
    container/use_application_default_credentials Google Cloud CLI property
    (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/properties) to true before running the
    command.

    See https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/kubectl for kubectl
    documentation.

EXAMPLES
    To get credentials of a cluster named my-cluster managed in location
    us-west1, run:

        $ gcloud container aws clusters get-credentials my-cluster \
            --location=us-west1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - cluster to get credentials. The arguments in this group
     can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster. To
          set the cluster attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location for the cluster. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cluster on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property container_aws/location.

FLAGS
     --private-endpoint
        If set, use private VPC for authentication.
