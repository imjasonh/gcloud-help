NAME
    gcloud container clusters - deploy and teardown Google Kubernetes Engine
        clusters

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud container clusters COMMAND
        [--location=LOCATION | --region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The gcloud container clusters command group lets you deploy and teardown
    Google Kubernetes Engine clusters.

    See $ gcloud docker --help for information about deploying docker images to
    clusters.

FLAGS
     At most one of these can be specified:

       --location=LOCATION
          Compute zone or region (e.g. us-central1-a or us-central1) for the
          cluster. Overrides the default compute/region or compute/zone value
          for this command invocation. Prefer using this flag over the --region
          or --zone flags.

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for a regional cluster. Overrides
          the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for a zonal cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
