NAME
    gcloud container clusters delete - delete an existing cluster for running
        containers

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud container clusters delete NAME [NAME ...] [--async]
        [--location=LOCATION | --region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    When you delete a cluster, the following resources are deleted:

      ▪ The control plane resources
      ▪ All of the node instances in the cluster
      ▪ Any Pods that are running on those instances
      ▪ Any firewalls and routes created by Kubernetes Engine at the time of
        cluster creation
      ▪ Data stored in host hostPath and emptyDir volumes

    GKE will attempt to delete the following resources. Deletion of these
    resources is not always guaranteed:

      ▪ External load balancers created by the cluster
      ▪ Internal load balancers created by the cluster
      ▪ Persistent disk volumes

EXAMPLES
    To delete an existing cluster, run:

        $ gcloud container clusters delete sample-cluster

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        The names of the clusters to delete.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --location=LOCATION
          Compute zone or region (e.g. us-central1-a or us-central1) for the
          cluster.

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha container clusters delete

        $ gcloud beta container clusters delete
