NAME
    gcloud container hub memberships unregister - unregister a cluster from
        Fleet

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud container hub memberships unregister MEMBERSHIP_NAME
        (--gke-cluster=LOCATION/CLUSTER_NAME | --gke-uri=GKE_URI
          | [--context=CONTEXT : --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG])
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command unregisters a cluster with the fleet by:

        1. Deleting the Fleet Membership resource for this cluster (a.k.a
           `gcloud container hub memberships delete`).
        2. Removing the corresponding in-cluster Kubernetes Resources that make the
           cluster exclusive to one fleet (a.k.a `kubectl delete memberships
           membership`).
        3. Uninstalling the Connect Agent from this cluster (a.k.a
           `kubectl delete on the gke-connect namespace`).

    The unregister command makes additional internal checks to ensure that all
    three steps can be safely done to properly clean-up in-Fleet and in-cluster
    resources.

    To register a non-GKE cluster use --context flag (with an optional
    --kubeconfig flag).

    To register a GKE cluster use --gke-cluster or --gke-uri flag (no
    --kubeconfig flag is required).

    To only delete the Fleet membership resource, consider using the command:
    gcloud container hub memberships delete. This command is intended to delete
    stale Fleet Membership resources as doing so on a fully registered cluster
    will skip some of the steps above and orphan in-cluster resources and agent
    connections to Google.

EXAMPLES
    Unregister a non-GKE cluster referenced from a specific kubeconfig file:

        $ gcloud container hub memberships unregister my-membership \
            --context=my-cluster-context \
            --kubeconfig=/home/user/custom_kubeconfig

    Unregister a non-GKE cluster referenced from the default kubeconfig file:

        $ gcloud container hub memberships unregister my-membership \
            --context=my-cluster-context

    Unregister a GKE cluster referenced from a GKE URI:

        $ gcloud container hub memberships unregister my-membership \
            --gke-uri=my-cluster-gke-uri

    Unregister a GKE cluster referenced from a GKE Cluster location and name:

        $ gcloud container hub memberships unregister my-membership \
            --gke-cluster=my-cluster-region-or-zone/my-cluster

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     MEMBERSHIP_NAME
        The membership name that corresponds to the cluster being unregistered.
        To get list of all the memberships on the Fleet, consider using the
        command: gcloud container hub memberships list.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Cluster identifier.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --gke-cluster=LOCATION/CLUSTER_NAME
          The location/name of the GKE cluster. The location can be a zone or a
          region for e.g us-central1-a/my-cluster.

       --gke-uri=GKE_URI
          The URI of a GKE cluster that you want to register to Hub; for
          example,
          'https://container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/clusters/my-cluster'.
          To obtain the URI, you can run 'gcloud container clusters list
          --uri'. Note that this should only be provided if the cluster being
          registered is a GKE cluster. The service will validate the provided
          URI to confirm that it maps to a valid GKE cluster."

       Non-GKE cluster identifier.

         --context=CONTEXT
            The cluster context as it appears in the kubeconfig file. You can
            get this value from the command line by running command: kubectl
            config current-context.

            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG
            The kubeconfig file containing an entry for the cluster. Defaults
            to $KUBECONFIG if it is set in the environment, otherwise defaults
            to $HOME/.kube/config.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister

        $ gcloud beta container hub memberships unregister
