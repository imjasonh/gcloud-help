NAME
    gcloud container fleet memberships get-credentials - fetch credentials for
        a fleet-registered cluster to be used in Connect Gateway

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud container fleet memberships get-credentials MEMBERSHIP
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud container fleet memberships get-credentials updates the kubeconfig
    file with the appropriate credentials and endpoint information to send
    kubectl commands to a fleet-registered and connected cluster through
    Connect Gateway Service.

    It takes a project, passed through by set defaults or flags. By default,
    credentials are written to $HOME/.kube/config. You can provide an alternate
    path by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable. If KUBECONFIG contains
    multiple paths, the first one is used.

    Upon success, this command will switch current context to the target
    cluster, when working with multiple clusters.

        $ gcloud container fleet memberships get-credentials my-cluster
