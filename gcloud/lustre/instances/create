DESCRIPTION
    Creates a Managed Lustre instance.

EXAMPLES
    To create an instance my-instance in location us-central1-a with 18000 Gib
    capacity run:

        $ gcloud lustre instances create my-instance --capacity-gib=18000 \
            --location=us-central1-a \
            --network=projects/my-project/global/networks/default \
            --filesystem=lustrefs --per-unit-storage-throughput=1000

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - Identifier. The name of the instance. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance.

          To set the instance attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the instance resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument instance on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --capacity-gib=CAPACITY_GIB
        The storage capacity of the instance in gibibytes (GiB). Allowed values
        are from 18000 to 954000, in increments of 9000.

     --filesystem=FILESYSTEM
        The filesystem name for this instance. This name is used by client-side
        tools, including when mounting the instance. Must be eight characters
        or less and can only contain letters and numbers.

     Network resource - The full name of the VPC network to which the instance
     is connected. Must be in the format
     projects/{project_id}/global/networks/{network_name}. This represents a
     Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --network on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       --network=NETWORK
          ID of the network or fully qualified identifier for the network.

          To set the network attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument --network on the command line.

     --per-unit-storage-throughput=PER_UNIT_STORAGE_THROUGHPUT
        The throughput of the instance in MB/s/TiB. Valid values are 125, 250,
        500, 1000.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A user-readable description of the instance.

     --gke-support-enabled
        Indicates whether you want to enable support for GKE clients. By
        default, GKE clients are not supported.

     --labels=[LABELS,...]
        Labels as key value pairs.

         KEY
            Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
            (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers.

         VALUE
            Values must contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase
            characters, and numbers.

        Shorthand Example:

            --labels=string=string

        JSON Example:

            --labels='{"string": "string"}'

        File Example:

            --labels=path_to_file.(yaml|json)

     --request-id=REQUEST_ID
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request
        ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
        ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
        guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
        the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
        request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
        request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.
        This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID
        is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
