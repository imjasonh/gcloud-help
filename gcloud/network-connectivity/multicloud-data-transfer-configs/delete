SYNOPSIS
    gcloud network-connectivity multicloud-data-transfer-configs delete

DESCRIPTION
    Delete a multicloudDataTransferConfig

EXAMPLES
    To delete the multicloudDataTransferConfig, run:

    $ gcloud network-connectivity multicloud-data-transfer-configs \        delete config-1 --location=europe-west1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     MulticloudDataTransferConfig resource - The name of the
     MulticloudDataTransferConfig resource to delete. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument multicloud_data_transfer_config on the command
        line with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       MULTICLOUD_DATA_TRANSFER_CONFIG
          ID of the multicloudDataTransferConfig or fully qualified identifier
          for the multicloudDataTransferConfig.

          To set the multicloud_data_transfer_config attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument multicloud_data_transfer_config on the
            command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the multicloudDataTransferConfig resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument multicloud_data_transfer_config on the
            command line with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --etag=ETAG
        The etag is computed by the server, and might be sent with update and
        delete requests so that the client has an up-to-date value before
        proceeding.

     --request-id=REQUEST_ID
        A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that
        if you must retry your request, the server can ignore the request if it
        has already been completed. The server waits for at least 60 minutes
        since the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
        the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
        request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
        request ID was received, and if so, can ignore the second request. This
        prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate
        MulticloudDataTransferConfig resources.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID
        (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) isn't supported.
