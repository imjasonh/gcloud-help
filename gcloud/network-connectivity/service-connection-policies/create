DESCRIPTION
    Create a new Service Connection Policy with the given name.

EXAMPLES
    Create a Service Connection Policy with name my-service-conn-policy for
    network projects/my-project/global/networks/net1 and service class
    my-service-class-ad32fa4b in region us-central1 using subnet
    projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/subnet1 subject to
    custom-resource-hierarchy-levels that allows connections from
    Google-managed producer instances in projects/my-project.

        $ gcloud network-connectivity service-connection-policies create \
            my-service-conn-policy \
            --network="projects/my-project/global/networks/net1" \
            --service-class=my-service-class-ad32fa4b --region=us-central1 \
            --subnets=projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/\
        subnet1 --psc-connection-limit=100 \
            --producer-instance-location=custom-resource-hierarchy-levels \
            --allowed-google-producers-resource-hierarchy-level=projects/\
        my-project

          ▸ provide the argument service_connection_policy on the command
            line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Network resource - Network that this service connection policy applies to.
     E.g. projects/my-project/global/networks/net1 This represents a Cloud
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument --network on the command line with a fully

          ▸ provide the argument --network on the command line.

     --service-class=SERVICE_CLASS
        Service class that this policy is created for. E.g.
        my-service-class-ad32fa4b

     This must be specified.

       Subnetwork resource - Subnetwork to use for IP address management. This
       represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
       arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

       To set the project attribute:
        ▸ provide the argument --subnets on the command line with a fully

         --subnets=[SUBNETS,...]
            IDs of the subnetworks or fully qualified identifiers for the
            subnetworks.

            To set the subnetwork attribute:
            ▫ provide the argument --subnets on the command line.

       --allowed-google-producers-resource-hierarchy-level=[ALLOWED_GOOGLE_PRODUCERS_RESOURCE_HIERARCHY_LEVEL,...]
          List of projects, folders, or orgs where the producer instance can be
          located in the form "projects/123456789", folders/123456789", or

       --producer-instance-location=PRODUCER_INSTANCE_LOCATION
          Option that determines where the producer instances can be located
          for which connections can be created in the network controlled by
          this policy. PRODUCER_INSTANCE_LOCATION must be one of:

           custom-resource-hierarchy-levels
              The producer instance must be located in one of the values
              provided in the allowed-google-producers-resource-hierarchy-level
              flag.
           none
              The producer instance must be within the same project as this
              connection policy.

       --psc-connection-limit=PSC_CONNECTION_LIMIT
          Max number of PSC connections for this policy.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the Service Connection Policy to be created.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

     --region=REGION
        For resources [service_connection_policy, subnets], provides fallback
        value for resource region attribute. When the resource's full URI path
        is not provided, region will fallback to this flag value.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
