SYNOPSIS
    gcloud network-connectivity spokes linked-interconnect-attachments create
        (SPOKE : --region=REGION) --hub=HUB
        --interconnect-attachments=[INTERCONNECT_ATTACHMENTS,...] [--async]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--include-import-ranges=[INCLUDE_IMPORT_RANGES,...]]

DESCRIPTION
    Create a new VLAN attachment spoke
    (https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/network-connectivity-center/how-to/working-with-hubs-spokes#create-vlan-spoke).

EXAMPLES
    To create a spoke in region us-central1 that uses data transfer and has two
    VLAN attachments, run:

        $ gcloud network-connectivity spokes \
            linked-interconnect-attachments create my-spoke \
            --hub="https://www.googleapis.com/networkconnectivity/v1/project\
        s/my-project/locations/global/hubs/my-hub" --region=us-central1 \
            --interconnect-attachments=https://www.googleapis.com/compute/\
        v1/projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/interconnectAttachments/\
        ic1,https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/\
        regions/us-central1/interconnectAttachments/ic2 \
            --site-to-site-data-transfer

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Spoke resource - Name of the spoke to be created. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument spoke on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       SPOKE
          ID of the spoke or fully qualified identifier for the spoke.

          To set the spoke attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument spoke on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The location Id.

          To set the region attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument spoke on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --hub=HUB
        Hub that the spoke will attach to. The hub must already exist.

     --interconnect-attachments=[INTERCONNECT_ATTACHMENTS,...]
        VLAN attachments that the spoke provides connectivity to. The resources
        must already exist.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the spoke to create.

     --include-import-ranges=[INCLUDE_IMPORT_RANGES,...]
        IP address range(s) allowed to be imported from hub subnets. Only
        ``ALL_IPV4_RANGES`` can be added to the list. If it's empty, the spoke
        does not import any subnets from the hub.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --site-to-site-data-transfer
        Whether to enable site-to-site data transfer for this spoke. Data
        transfer is available only in supported locations
        (https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/network-connectivity-center/concepts/locations).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
