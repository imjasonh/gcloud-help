EXAMPLES
    To grant a user the roles/networkconnectivity.groupUser role on the group
    called my-group in the hub called my-hub', run the following command:

        $ gcloud network-connectivity hubs groups add-iam-policy-binding \
            my-group --member="user:username@gmail.com" \
            --role="roles/networkconnectivity.groupUser" --hub="my-hub"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Group resource - The group that you want to update. The arguments in this

      ◆ provide the argument group on the command line with a fully specified
        name;

      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

          To set the group attribute:

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --hub=HUB
          Id of the hub.

          To set the hub attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument group on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --hub on the command line.
