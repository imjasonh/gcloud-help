        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--max-backoff=MAX_BACKOFF; default="1h"]

DESCRIPTION
    Create a Cloud Scheduler job with a Pub/Sub target.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a job that publishes a message with the body
    'Hello' to the Pub/Sub topic 'cron-topic' every 3 hours:

        $ gcloud scheduler jobs create pubsub my-job \
            --schedule="0 */3 * * *" --topic=cron-topic \
            --message-body="Hello"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Job resource - Job to create. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument job on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       JOB
          ID of the job or fully qualified identifier for the job. To set the
          job attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument job on the command line.

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the job. By default, uses the location of the current
          project's App Engine app if there is an associated app.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument job on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ defaults to App Engine's app location if not provided & an app
            exists.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --schedule=SCHEDULE
        Schedule on which the job will be executed.

        As a general rule, execution n + 1 of a job will not begin until
        execution n has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two
        simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that
        if the n+1 execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the n execution
        takes until 16:15, the n+1 execution will not start until 16:15. A
        scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not
        ended when its scheduled time occurs.

        If --retry-count > 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a
        total of --retry-count times, with exponential backoff, until the next
        scheduled start time.

        The schedule can be either of the following types:
        ◆ Crontab: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview
        ◆ English-like schedule:
          https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/quickstart#defining_the_job_schedule

     --topic=TOPIC
        Name of the Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic to publish to when the job runs.

     Body of the message to publish to the given topic name. Information on
     message formatting and size limits can be found at:
     https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publisher#publish

    At least one of these must be specified:

         --attributes=ATTRIBUTES
            Comma-separated list of attributes. Each attribute has the form
            "NAME=VALUE". You can specify up to 100 attributes.

         At most one of these can be specified:

           --message-body=MESSAGE_BODY
              Body of the message.

           --message-body-from-file=MESSAGE_BODY_FROM_FILE
              Path to a file containing the body of the message.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable description of the job.

     --max-backoff=MAX_BACKOFF; default="1h"
        Maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it fails.
        For example, 10m. Default is 1h.

     --max-doublings=MAX_DOUBLINGS; default=16
        Maximum number of times that the interval between failed job retries
        will be doubled before the increase becomes constant.

     --max-retry-attempts=MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS
        Number of times to retry the request if it fails or times out. Must be
        in range 0-5 inclusive. Default is 0.

     --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
        Time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was
        first run. If specified with --max-retry-attempts greater than 0, the
        task will be retried until both limits are reached. Default is 0 (which
        means unlimited).

     --min-backoff=MIN_BACKOFF; default="5s"
        Minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it fails.
        For example, 10s. Default is 5s.

     --time-zone=TIME_ZONE; default="Etc/UTC"
        Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting --schedule. The
        value of this field must be a time zone name from the tz database
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

        Note that some time zones include a provision for daylight savings
        time. The rules for daylight saving time are determined by the chosen
        time zone.

        For UTC use the string "utc". Default is "utc".
