DESCRIPTION
    Update a Cloud Scheduler job with an App Engine target.

EXAMPLES
    Update my-job's retry attempt limit:

        $ gcloud scheduler jobs update app-engine my-job \
            --max-retry-attempts=2

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Job resource - Job to update. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument job on the command line with a fully specified
        name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       JOB
          ID of the job or fully qualified identifier for the job.

          To set the job attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument job on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the job. By default, uses the location of the current
          project's App Engine app if there is an associated app.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument job on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ defaults to App Engine's app location if not provided & an app
            exists.

FLAGS
     --attempt-deadline=ATTEMPT_DEADLINE
        The deadline for job attempts. If the request handler doesn't respond
        by this dealine, the request is cancelled and the attempt is marked as
        failed. For example, 20s.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable description of the job.

     --http-method=HTTP_METHOD; default="post"
        HTTP method to use for the request. HTTP_METHOD must be one of: delete,
        get, head, post, put.

     --schedule=SCHEDULE
        Schedule on which the job will be executed.

        As a general rule, execution n + 1 of a job will not begin until
        execution n has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two
        simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that
        if the n+1 execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the n execution
        takes until 16:15, the n+1 execution will not start until 16:15. A
        scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not
        ended when its scheduled time occurs. Learn more about the cron job
        format
        (https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/cron-job-schedules).

        If --retry-count > 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a
        total of --retry-count times, with exponential backoff, until the job
        succeeds or the number of retries is exhausted. Note that the next
        scheduled execution time might be skipped if the retries continue
        through that time. For more information, see Retry jobs
        (https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/retry-jobs).

     --version=VERSION
        Version of the App Engine service to send the request to.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-headers
          Clear the list of HTTP headers.

       Or at least one of these can be specified:

         --remove-headers=[REMOVE_HEADERS,...]
            KEY1,KEY2 list of HTTP headers to remove from the request.
            --remove-headers Accept-Language,Accept

         --update-headers=[KEY=VALUE,...]
            KEY=VALUE pairs of HTTP headers to include in the request. Cannot
            be repeated. For example: --update-headers
            Accept-Language=en-us,Accept=text/plain

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-backoff
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-backoff.

       --max-backoff=MAX_BACKOFF; default="3600s"
          Maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails.
          For example, 60s. Default is 3600s (1 hour).

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-doublings
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-doublings.

       --max-doublings=MAX_DOUBLINGS; default=5
          Maximum number of times that the interval between failed job retries
          will be doubled before the increase becomes constant.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-retry-attempts
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-retry-attempts.

       --max-retry-attempts=MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS
          Number of times to retry the request if it fails or times out. Must
          be in range 0-5 inclusive. Default is 0.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-max-retry-duration
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-retry-duration.

       --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
          Time limit for retrying a failed job, measured from when the job was
          first run. If specified with --max-retry-attempts greater than 0, the
          job will be retried until both limits are reached. Default is 0
          seconds (which means unlimited); however, if --max-retry-attempts is
          also 0, a job attempt won't be retried if it fails.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-message-body
