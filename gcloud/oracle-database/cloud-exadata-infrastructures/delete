POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CloudExadataInfrastructure resource - The name of the Cloud Exadata
     Infrastructure in the following format:
     projects/{project}/locations/{location}/cloudExadataInfrastructures/{cloud_exadata_infrastructure}.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument cloud_exadata_infrastructure on the command line
        with a fully specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CLOUD_EXADATA_INFRASTRUCTURE
          ID of the cloudExadataInfrastructure or fully qualified identifier
          for the cloudExadataInfrastructure.

          To set the cloud_exadata_infrastructure attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cloud_exadata_infrastructure on the command
            line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the cloudExadataInfrastructure resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument cloud_exadata_infrastructure on the command
            line with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --force
        If set to true, all VM clusters for this Exadata Infrastructure will be
        deleted. An Exadata Infrastructure can only be deleted once all its VM
        clusters have been deleted.

     --request-id=REQUEST_ID
        An optional ID to identify the request. This value is used to identify
        duplicate requests. If you make a request with the same request ID and
        the original request is still in progress or completed, the server
        ignores the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally
        creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID
        is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
