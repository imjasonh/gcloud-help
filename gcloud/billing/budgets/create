            --threshold-rule=percent=0.50 \
            --threshold-rule=percent=0.75,basis=forecasted-spend

     budget. This represents a Cloud resource.

     This must be specified.

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT
          ID of the billing-account or fully qualified identifier for the
          billing-account.

        User data for display name in UI. Must be less than or equal to 60
        characters.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --budget-amount=BUDGET_AMOUNT
          Specify the amount of the budget. If a currency type is included, it
          must be the currency associated with the billing account. If

          billing account.

       --last-period-amount
          Use the amount of last period's budget.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --credit-types-treatment=CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT
        Whether to include all credit types when calculating the actual spend
        against the budget. If this is not specified, then all credit types are
        used in the calculation. If this is set to include-specified-credits,
        then --filter-credit-types must be specified with a nonempty list of
        credits. CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT must be one of:
        credit-types-treatment-unspecified, exclude-all-credits,
        include-all-credits, include-specified-credits.

     --disable-default-iam-recipients

        is exceeded. Default notifications are sent to those with Billing
        Account Administrator and Billing Account User IAM roles for the target
        account.

     --filter-credit-types=[FILTER_CREDIT_TYPES,...]
        Set of credit types, specifying that usage from only this set of
        credits should be included in the budget. If a nonempty list is
        specified, then --credit-types-treatment must be
        include-specified-credits.

     --filter-labels=FILTER_LABELS
        Single label and value pair specifying that usage from only this set of
        labeled resources should be included in the budget. Currently, multiple
        entries or multiple values per entry are not allowed. If omitted, the
        report will include all labeled and unlabeled usage.

     --filter-projects=[FILTER_PROJECTS,...]
        Set of projects in the form projects/{project_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of projects should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, all projects will be included.

     --filter-services=[FILTER_SERVICES,...]
        Set of services of the form services/{service_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of services should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, the report will include usage for all services. The service
        names are available through the Catalog API:
        https://cloud.google.com/billing/v1/how-tos/catalog-api.

        that usage from only this set of subaccounts should be included in the
        budget. If a subaccount is set to the name of the parent account, usage
        from the parent account will be included. If omitted, the report will
        include usage from the parent account and all subaccounts, if they
        exist.

     --notifications-rule-monitoring-notification-channels=[NOTIFICATIONS_RULE_MONITORING_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS,...]
        Targets to send notifications to when a threshold is exceeded. This is
        in addition to default recipients who have billing account IAM roles.
        The value is the full REST resource name of a monitoring notification
        channel in the form
        projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id}. A maximum of 5
        channels is allowed. See
        https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-notification-recipients
        for more details.

     --notifications-rule-pubsub-topic=NOTIFICATIONS_RULE_PUBSUB_TOPIC
        Name of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic where budget related messages will be
        published, in the form projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}.

     --threshold-rule=THRESHOLD_RULE
        Rule that triggers alerts (notifications of thresholds being crossed)
        when spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget. This flag
        can be repeated to provide multiple thresholds above which an alert is
        sent.

         percent
            Number between 0.0 and 1.0. This is a 1.0-based percentage; for
            example 0.5 equals 50 percent. An alert is sent for anything above
            the value set.

         basis
            Type of basis used to determine if spend has passed the threshold.
            Must be one of: 'current-spend' or 'forecasted-spend'. Behavior
            defaults to 'current-spend' if not set.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --calendar-period=CALENDAR_PERIOD
          Specifies to track usage over recurring calendar period. If you're
          creating a budget with a custom time period, omit this flag.
          CALENDAR_PERIOD must be one of: calendar-period-unspecified, month,
          quarter, year.

       --start-date=START_DATE
          Specifies to track usage after any start date. This time period is
          static, it does not recur.

          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --end-date=END_DATE
          Specifies to track usage before any end date. This time period is
          static, it does not recur. If specified, --start-date must also be
          specified.
