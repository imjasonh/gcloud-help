POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FrameworkDeployment resource - The name of the framework deployment that
     you want to delete, in the format
     organizations/{organization}/locations/{location}/frameworkDeployments/{framework_deployment_id}.
     The only supported location is global. The arguments in this group can be
     used to specify the attributes of this resource.

     This must be specified.

       FRAMEWORK_DEPLOYMENT
          ID of the frameworkDeployment or fully qualified identifier for the
          frameworkDeployment.

          To set the framework_deployment attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument framework_deployment on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location id of the frameworkDeployment resource.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument framework_deployment on the command line
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization id of the frameworkDeployment resource.

          To set the organization attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument framework_deployment on the command line
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --organization on the command line.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --etag=ETAG
        An opaque identifier for the current version of the resource.

        If you provide this value, then it must match the existing value. If
        the values don't match, then the request fails with an
        [ABORTED][google.rpc.Code.ABORTED] error.

        If you omit this value, then the resource is deleted regardless of its
        current etag value.
