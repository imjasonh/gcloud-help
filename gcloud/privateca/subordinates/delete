NAME
    gcloud privateca subordinates delete - delete a subordinate certificate
        authority

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud privateca subordinates delete
        (CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY : --location=LOCATION --pool=POOL)
        [--ignore-active-certificates] [--skip-grace-period]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete a Subordinate Certificate Authority. Deleted Subordinate Certificate
    Authorities may be recovered with the gcloud privateca subordinates
    undelete command within a grace period of 30 days.

    Use the --skip-grace-period flag to delete as soon as possible without the
    30-day grace period to undelete.

    Note that any user-managed KMS keys or Google Cloud Storage buckets will
    not be affected by this operation. You will need to delete the user-
    managed resources separately once the CA is deleted. Any Google-managed
    resources will be cleaned up.

    The CA specified in this command MUST:

        1) be in the DISABLED or STAGED state.
        2) have no un-revoked or un-expired certificates. Use the revoke command
           to revoke any active certificates.

    Use the --ignore-active-certificates flag to remove 2) as a requirement.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a subordinate CA:

        $ gcloud privateca subordinates delete server-tls-1 --pool=my-pool \
            --location=us-west1

    To delete a CA while skipping the confirmation input:

        $ gcloud privateca subordinates delete server-tls-1s \
            --pool=my-pool --location=us-west1 --quiet

    To undo the deletion for a subordinate CA:

        $ gcloud privateca subordinates undelete server-tls-1 \
            --pool=my-pool --location=us-west1

          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

FLAGS
     --ignore-active-certificates

        after the grace period.

     --skip-grace-period
        If this flag is set, the Certificate Authority will be deleted as soon
        as possible without a 30-day grace period where undeletion would have
