NAME
    gcloud privateca pools delete - delete a CA pool

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud privateca pools delete (CA_POOL : --location=LOCATION)
        [--ignore-dependent-resources] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Note that all certificate authorities must be removed from the CA Pool
    before the CA pool can be deleted.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a CA pool:

        $ gcloud privateca pools delete my-pool --location=us-west1

    To delete a CA pool while skipping the confirmation input:

        $ gcloud privateca pools delete my-pool --location=us-west1 --quiet

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CA POOL resource - The ca pool to delete. The arguments in this group can
     be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument CA_POOL on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CA_POOL
          ID of the CA_POOL or fully qualified identifier for the CA_POOL.

          To set the pool attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument CA_POOL on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the CA_POOL.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument CA_POOL on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property privateca/location.

FLAGS
     --ignore-dependent-resources
        This field skips the integrity check that would normally prevent
        breaking a CA Pool if it is used by another cloud resource and allows
        the CA Pool to be in a state where it is not able to issue
        certificates. Doing so may result in unintended and unrecoverable
        effects on any dependent resource(s) since the CA Pool would not be
        able to issue certificates.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
