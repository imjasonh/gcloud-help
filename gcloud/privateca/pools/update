NAME
    gcloud privateca pools update - update an existing CA Pool

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud privateca pools update (CA_POOL : --location=LOCATION)
        [--issuance-policy=ISSUANCE_POLICY] [--no-publish-ca-cert]
        [--no-publish-crl]
        [--publishing-encoding-format=PUBLISHING_ENCODING_FORMAT;
          default="pem"] [--update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--clear-labels | --remove-labels=[KEY,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

EXAMPLES
    To update labels on a CA pool:

        $ gcloud privateca pools update my-pool --location=us-west1 \
            --update-labels=foo=bar

    To disable publishing CRLs on a CA pool:

        $ gcloud privateca pools update my-pool --location=us-west1 \
            --no-publish-crl

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CA POOL resource - The ca pool to update. The arguments in this group can
     be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument CA_POOL on the command line with a fully
        specified name;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line;
      ◆ set the property core/project.

     This must be specified.

       CA_POOL
          ID of the CA_POOL or fully qualified identifier for the CA_POOL.

          To set the pool attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument CA_POOL on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the CA_POOL.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument CA_POOL on the command line with a fully
            specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property privateca/location.

FLAGS
     --issuance-policy=ISSUANCE_POLICY
        A YAML file describing this CA Pool's issuance policy.

     --publish-ca-cert
        If this is enabled, the following will happen: 1) The CA certificates
        will be written to a known location within the CA distribution point.
        2) The AIA extension in all issued certificates will point to the CA
        cert URL in that distribution point.

        If this gets disabled, the AIA extension will not be written to any
        future certificates issued by this CA. However, an existing bucket will
        not be deleted, and the CA certificates will not be removed from that
        bucket.

        Note that the same bucket may be used for the CRLs if --publish-crl is
        set.

        Enabled by default, use --no-publish-ca-cert to disable.

     --publish-crl
        If this gets enabled, the following will happen: 1) CRLs will be
        written to a known location within the CA distribution point. 2) The
        CDP extension in all future issued certificates will point to the CRL
        URL in that distribution point.

        If this gets disabled, the CDP extension will not be written to any
        future certificates issued by CAs in this pool, and new CRLs will not
        be published to that bucket (which affects existing certs). However, an
        existing bucket will not be deleted, and any existing CRLs will not be
        removed from that bucket.

        Note that the same bucket may be used for the CA cert if
        --publish-ca-cert is set.

        CRL publication is not supported for CAs in the DevOps tier.

        Enabled by default, use --no-publish-crl to disable.

     --publishing-encoding-format=PUBLISHING_ENCODING_FORMAT; default="pem"
        The encoding format of the content published to storage buckets.
        PUBLISHING_ENCODING_FORMAT must be one of: der, pem.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value
        is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these can be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud privateca pools update --clear-labels

          To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:

              $ gcloud privateca pools update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --update-labels is applied first.
