NAME
    gcloud components - list, install, update, or remove Google Cloud CLI
        components

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud components GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The gcloud components command group lets you control which tools are
    installed in the Google Cloud CLI. It can be used to install, update and
    remove components of the Google Cloud CLI, ensuring a lean, up-to-date
    installation.

    gcloud components regularly checks whether updates are available for the
    tools you already have installed, and gives you the opportunity to upgrade
    to the latest version.

    Certain components have dependencies. gcloud components will install any
    dependencies, and during removal, any dependant components will be
    uninstalled automatically.

EXAMPLES
    To see all available components:

        $ gcloud components list

    To install a component you don't have:

        $ gcloud components install COMPONENT

    To remove a component you no longer need:

        $ gcloud components remove COMPONENT

    To update all components you have to their latest version:

        $ gcloud components update

    To update all installed components to version 1.2.3:

        $ gcloud components update --version 1.2.3
