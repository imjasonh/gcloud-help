NAME
    gcloud components reinstall - reinstall the Google Cloud CLI with the same
        components you have now

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud components reinstall [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    If your Google Cloud CLI installation becomes corrupt, this command
    attempts to fix it by downloading the latest version of the Google Cloud
    CLI and reinstalling it. This will replace your existing installation with
    a fresh one. The command is the equivalent of deleting your current
    installation, downloading a fresh copy of the gcloud CLI, and installing in
    the same location.

EXAMPLES
    To reinstall all components you have installed, run:

        $ gcloud components reinstall

    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
