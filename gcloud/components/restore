NAME
    gcloud components restore - restore the Google Cloud CLI installation to
        its previous state

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud components restore [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This is an undo operation, which restores the Google Cloud CLI installation
    on the local workstation to the state it was in just before the most recent
    gcloud components update, gcloud components remove, or gcloud components
    install command. Only the state before the most recent such state is
    remembered, so it is impossible to restore the state that existed before
    the two most recent update commands, for example. A restore command does
    not undo a previous restore command.

EXAMPLES
    To restore Google Cloud CLI installation to its previous state, run:

        $ gcloud components restore

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
