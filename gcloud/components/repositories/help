NAME
    gcloud components repositories - manage additional component repositories
        for Trusted Tester programs

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud components repositories COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    List, add, and remove component repositories for Trusted Tester programs.
    If you are not participating in a Trusted Tester program, these commands
    are not necessary for updating your Google Cloud CLI installation.

    If you are participating in a Trusted Tester program, you will be
    instructed on the location of repositories that you should add. These
    commands allow you to manage the set of repositories you have registered.

    Once you have a repository registered, the component manager will use that
    location to locate new Google Cloud CLI components that are available, or
    possibly different versions of existing components that can be installed.

    If you want to revert to a standard version of the Google Cloud CLI at any
    time, you may remove all repositories and then run:

        $ gcloud components update

    to revert to a standard installation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
