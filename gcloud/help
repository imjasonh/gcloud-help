NAME
    gcloud help - search gcloud help text

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud help [COMMAND ...] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT; default=5]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]; default="~relevance"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...] [-- SEARCH_TERMS ...]

DESCRIPTION
    If a full gcloud command is specified after the help operand, gcloud help
    prints a detailed help message for that command.

    Otherwise, gcloud help runs a search for all commands with help text
    matching the given argument or arguments. It prints the command name and a
    summary of the help text for any command that it finds as a result.

    To run a search directly, you can use remainder arguments, following a --.

    By default, command results are displayed in a table that shows the name of
    the command and snippets of the help text that relate to your search terms.

    By default, search results are sorted from most to least relevant by
    default, using a localized rating based on several heuristics. These
    heuristics may change in future runs of this command.

EXAMPLES
    To get the help for the command gcloud projects describe, run:

        $ gcloud help projects describe

    To search for all commands whose help text contains the word project, run:

        $ gcloud help -- project

    To search for commands whose help text contains the word project and the
    string --foo, run:

        $ gcloud help -- project --foo

    To search and receive more than the default limit of 5 search results, run:

        $ gcloud help --limit=20 -- project

    To search for a term and sort the results by a different characteristic,
    such as command name, run:

        $ gcloud help --sort-by=name -- project

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [COMMAND ...]
        Sequence of names representing a gcloud group or command name.

        If the arguments provide the name of a gcloud command, the full help
        text of that command will be displayed. Otherwise, all arguments will
        be considered search terms and used to search through all of gcloud's
        help text.

     [-- SEARCH_TERMS ...]
        Search terms. The command will return a list of gcloud commands that
        are relevant to the searched term. If this argument is provided, the
        command will always return a list of search results rather than
        displaying help text of a single command.

        For example, to search for commands that relate to the term project or
        folder, run:

            $ gcloud help -- project folder

        The '--' argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
        left and SEARCH_TERMS on the right.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT; default=5
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is 5. This flag
        interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: --flatten,
        --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]; default="~relevance"
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit. The
        default is ~relevance.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha help

        $ gcloud beta help
