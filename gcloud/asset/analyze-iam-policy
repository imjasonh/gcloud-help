DESCRIPTION
    Analyzes IAM policies that match a request.

EXAMPLES
    To find out which users have been granted the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
    permission on a service account, run:

        $ gcloud asset analyze-iam-policy --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID \
            --full-resource-name=YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FULL_RESOURCE_NAME \
            --permissions='iam.serviceAccounts.actAs'

    To find out which resources a user can access, run:

        $ gcloud asset analyze-iam-policy --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID \
            --identity='user:u1@foo.com'

    To find out which roles or permissions a user has been granted on a
    project, run:

        $ gcloud asset analyze-iam-policy --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID \
            --full-resource-name=YOUR_PROJECT_FULL_RESOURCE_NAME \
            --identity='user:u1@foo.com'

    To find out which users have been granted the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
    permission on any applicable resources, run:

        $ gcloud asset analyze-iam-policy --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID \
            --permissions='iam.serviceAccounts.actAs'

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder ID on which to perform the analysis. Only policies defined at
          or below this folder will be targeted in the analysis.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization ID on which to perform the analysis. Only policies
          defined at or below this organization will be targeted in the
          analysis.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project ID or number on which to perform the analysis. Only policies
          defined at or below this project will be targeted in the analysis.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     The hypothetical context to evaluate IAM conditions.

       --access-time=ACCESS_TIME
          The hypothetical access timestamp to evaluate IAM conditions.

     Specifies a resource for analysis. Leaving it empty means ANY.

       --full-resource-name=FULL_RESOURCE_NAME
          The full resource name.

     Specifies an identity for analysis. Leaving it empty means ANY.

       --identity=IDENTITY
          The identity appearing in the form of principals in the IAM policy
          binding.

     The analysis options.

       --analyze-service-account-impersonation
          If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to
          resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive
          operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly
          recommend you use AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning rpc instead. Default is
          false.

       --execution-timeout=EXECUTION_TIMEOUT
          The amount of time the executable has to complete. See JSON
          representation of Duration
          (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
          Deafult is empty.

       --expand-groups
          If true, the identities section of the result will expand any Google
          groups appearing in an IAM policy binding. Default is false.

       --expand-resources
          If true, the resource section of the result will expand any resource
          attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource
          hierarchy. Default is false.

       --expand-roles
          If true, the access section of result will expand any roles appearing
          in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions. Default is
          false.

       --output-group-edges
          If true, the result will output the relevant membership relationships
          between groups. Default is false.

       --output-resource-edges
          If true, the result will output the relevant parent/child
          relationships between resources. Default is false.

       --show-response
          If true, the response will be showed as-is in the command output.

     Specifies roles or permissions for analysis. Leaving it empty means ANY.

       --permissions=[PERMISSIONS,...]
          The permissions to appear in the result.

       --roles=[ROLES,...]
          The roles to appear in the result.
