NAME
    gcloud asset feeds delete - delete a Cloud Asset Inventory Feed

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud asset feeds delete FEED_ID
        (--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete a Cloud Asset Inventory Feed.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a feed 'feed1' in project 'p1', run:

        $ gcloud asset feeds delete feed1 --project=p1

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FEED_ID
        Asset feed identifier to delete.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the feed.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the feed.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          project of the feed.

          The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
          then the current project is assumed; the current project can be
          listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can
          be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
