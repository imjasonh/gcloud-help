NAME
    gcloud firebase test android list-device-capacities - list capacity
        information for Android models & versions

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud firebase test android list-device-capacities [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    List device capacity information (high/medium/low/none) for all Android
    models & versions which are available for testing and have capacity
    information published.

    Device capacity is the number of online devices in Firebase Test Lab. For
    physical devices, the number is the average of online devices in the last
    30 days. It's important to note that device capacity does not directly
    reflect any real-time data, like the length of the test queue, or the
    available/busy state of the devices based on current test traffic.

EXAMPLES
    To list all published capacity information for Android devices, run:

        $ gcloud firebase test android list-device-capacities

    To list capacity only for the model named 'redfin', run:

        $ gcloud firebase test android list-device-capacities --filter=redfin

    To list capacities only for models that support API version 30, run:

        $ gcloud firebase test android list-device-capacities --filter=30

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
