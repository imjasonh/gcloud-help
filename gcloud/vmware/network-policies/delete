SYNOPSIS
    gcloud vmware network-policies delete
        (NETWORK_POLICY : --location=LOCATION) [--async] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete a VMware Engine network policy.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a network policy called my-network-policy in project my-project
    and region us-west2, run:

        $ gcloud vmware network-policies delete my-network-policy \
            --location=us-west2 --project=my-project

    Or:

        $ gcloud vmware network-policies delete my-network-policy

    In the second example, the project and the location are taken from gcloud
    properties core/project and compute/region respectively.
