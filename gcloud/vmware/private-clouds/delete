NAME
    gcloud vmware private-clouds delete - delete a Google Cloud VMware Engine
        private cloud

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud vmware private-clouds delete (PRIVATE_CLOUD : --location=LOCATION)
        [--async] [--delay-hours=DELAY_HOURS; default=3] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Marks a VMware Engine private cloud for deletion. The resource is deleted 3
    hours after being marked for deletion. This process can be reversed by
    using gcloud vmware private-clouds undelete.

EXAMPLES
    To mark a private cloud called my-private-cloud for deletion, run:

        $ gcloud vmware private-clouds delete my-private-cloud \
            --location=us-west2-a --project=my-project

    Or:

        $ gcloud vmware private-clouds delete my-private-cloud

    In the second example, the project and location are taken from gcloud
    properties core/project and compute/zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Private cloud resource - private_cloud. The arguments in this group can be
     used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.

      ◆ provide the argument private_cloud on the command line with a fully
        specified name;

          cloud.

          To set the private-cloud attribute:
