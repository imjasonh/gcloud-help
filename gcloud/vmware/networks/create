NAME
    gcloud vmware networks create - create a Google Cloud VMware Engine network

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud vmware networks create (VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK : --location=LOCATION)
        --type=TYPE [--async] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create a VMware Engine network. VMware Engine network creation is
    considered finished when the VMware Engine network is in ACTIVE state.
    Check the progress of a VMware Engine network creation using gcloud vmware
    networks list.

EXAMPLES
    To create a VMware Engine network of type STANDARD, run:

        $ gcloud vmware networks create my-network --type=STANDARD \
            --location=global --project=my-project

    Or:

        $ gcloud vmware networks create my-network --type=STANDARD

    In the second example, the project is taken from gcloud properties
    core/project and the location is taken as global.

    To create a VMware Engine network of type LEGACY in the us-west2 region,
    run:

        $ gcloud vmware networks create my-network --type=LEGACY \
            --location=us-west2 --project=my-project

    Or:

        $ gcloud vmware networks create my-network --type=LEGACY \
            --location=us-west2

    In the last example, the project is taken from gcloud properties
    core/project. For VMware Engine networks of type LEGACY, you must always
    specify a region as the location.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     VMware Engine network resource - vmware_engine_network. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument vmware_engine_network on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK
          ID of the VMware Engine network or fully qualified identifier for the
          VMware Engine network.

          To set the vmware-engine-network attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument vmware_engine_network on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The resource name of the location.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument vmware_engine_network on the command line
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set location as 'global' (default) or a region.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --type=TYPE
        Type of the VMware Engine network. TYPE must be one of:

         LEGACY
            Network type used by private clouds created in projects without a
            network of type STANDARD. This network type is only used for new
            PCs in existing projects that continue to use LEGACY network. A
            VMware Engine network of type LEGACY is a regional resource.
         STANDARD
            Standard network type used for private cloud connectivity. A VMware
            Engine network of type STANDARD is a global resource.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete. The default is True. Enabled by default, use --no-async to
        disable.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Text describing the VMware Engine network.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
