NAME
    gcloud vmware networks delete - delete a Google Cloud VMware Engine network

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud vmware networks delete (VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK : --location=LOCATION)
        [--async] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete a VMware Engine network.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a network called my-network of type STANDARD in project
    my-project and region global, run:

        $ gcloud vmware networks delete my-network --location=global \
            --project=my-project

    Or:

        $ gcloud vmware networks delete my-network

    In the second example, the project is taken from gcloud properties
    core/project and the location is taken as global.

    To delete a network called my-network of type LEAGACY in project my-project
    and region us-west2, run:

        $ gcloud vmware networks delete my-network --location=us-west2 \
            --project=my-project

    Or:

        $ gcloud vmware networks delete my-network --location=us-west2

    In the last example, the project is taken from gcloud properties
    core/project. For VMware Engine networks of type LEGACY, you must always
    specify a region as the location.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     VMware Engine network resource - vmware_engine_network. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways. To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument vmware_engine_network on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK
          ID of the VMware Engine network or fully qualified identifier for the
          VMware Engine network. To set the vmware-engine-network attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument vmware_engine_network on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The resource name of the location. To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument vmware_engine_network on the command line
            with a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set location as 'global' (default) or a region.
