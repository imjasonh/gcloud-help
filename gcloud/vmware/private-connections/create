NAME
    gcloud vmware private-connections create - create a Google Cloud Private
        Connection

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud vmware private-connections create
        (PRIVATE_CONNECTION : --location=LOCATION)
        --service-project=SERVICE_PROJECT --type=TYPE
        --vmware-engine-network=VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK [--async]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--routing-mode=ROUTING_MODE]
        [--service-network=SERVICE_NETWORK] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a new private connection to connect VMware Engine Network to the
    specified VPC network. This establishes private IP connectivity between the
    VPC network and all the VMware Private Clouds attached to the VMware Engine
    Network. Private connection creation is considered finished when the
    connection is in ACTIVE state. Check the progress of the private connection
    using gcloud vmware private-connections list.

EXAMPLES
    To create a Private Connection of type PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS, first obtain
    the service-project by listing vpc-peerings, run:

        $ gcloud compute networks peerings list --network=my-vpc \
            --project=my-project

    where my-vpc is the VPC on which a private service access connection is
    created and project is the one in which the private connection will be
    created.

    The response will be of this format:

    NAME NETWORK PEER_PROJECT

    servicenetworking-googleapis-com my-vpc td096d594ece09650-tp

    The PEER_PROJECT field in the output of the command will provide the value
    for the service-project required for creating the private connection.

    To create a Private Connection called my-private-connection of type
    PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS in project my-project and region us-west1 with
    routing_mode REGIONAL to connect service networking VPC from project
    td096d594ece09650-tp to legacy VMware Engine Network us-west1-default, run:

        $ gcloud vmware private-connections create my-private-connection \
            --location=us-west1 --project=my-project \
            --vmware-engine-network=us-west1-default \
            --description="A short description for the new private \
        connection" --routing-mode=REGIONAL \
            --service-project=td096d594ece09650-tp \
            --type=PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS

    Or:

        $ gcloud vmware private-connections create my-private-connection \
            --vmware-engine-network=us-west1-default \
            --description="A short description for the new private \
        connection" --routing-mode=REGIONAL \
            --service-project=td096d594ece09650-tp \
            --type=PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS

        In the second example, the project and location are taken from gcloud properties core/project and compute/region, respectively.

    To create a Private Connection called my-private-connection of type
    THIRD_PARTY_SERVICE in project my-project and region us-west1 to connect
    VPC my-service-network from project td096d594ece09650-tp to legacy VMware
    Engine Network us-west1-default, run:

        $ gcloud vmware private-connections create my-private-connection \
            --location=us-west1 --project=my-project \
            --vmware-engine-network=us-west1-default \
            --description="A short description for the new private \
        connection" --service-network=my-service-network \
            --service-project=td096d594ece09650-tp \
            --type=THIRD_PARTY_SERVICE

    Or:

        $ gcloud vmware private-connections create my-private-connection \
            --vmware-engine-network=us-west1-default \
            --description="A short description for the new private \
        connection" --service-network=my-service-network \
            --service-project=td096d594ece09650-tp \
            --type=THIRD_PARTY_SERVICE

        In the above example, the project and location are taken from gcloud properties core/project and compute/region, respectively.

    If you try to create a private connection of type=THIRD_PARTY_SERVICE, and
    do not provide the service-network field, an error will be thrown with the
    message:

    Missing required argument [--service-network]: For private connection of
    type THIRD_PARTY_SERVICE, service-network field is required

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Private Connection resource - private_connection. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways.

     To set the project attribute:
      ◆ provide the argument private_connection on the command line with a
        fully specified name;
      ◆ set the property core/project;
      ◆ provide the argument --project on the command line.

     This must be specified.

       PRIVATE_CONNECTION
          ID of the Private Connection or fully qualified identifier for the
          Private Connection.

          To set the private-connection attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument private_connection on the command line.

          This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The resource name of the location.

          To set the location attribute:
          ▸ provide the argument private_connection on the command line with
            a fully specified name;
          ▸ provide the argument --location on the command line;
          ▸ set the property compute/region.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --service-project=SERVICE_PROJECT
        Project ID or project number of the service network.

     --type=TYPE
        Type of private connection. TYPE must be one of:

        specified in the private connection resource.

OPTIONAL FLAGS

          set to servicenetworking and cannot be changed.
        ◆ For type=NETAPP_CLOUD_VOLUME, this field represents NetApp service
          VPC. In this case the field value will be automatically set to
