SYNOPSIS
    gcloud vmware private-connections describe
        (PRIVATE_CONNECTION : --location=LOCATION) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

    the private connection, such as service_network, vmware_engine_network,
    routing_mode and state.

EXAMPLES
    To get the information about a private connection resource called
    my-private-connection in project my-project and region us-west1, run:

        $ gcloud vmware private-connections describe my-private-connection \
            --location=us-west1 --project=my-project

    Or:

        $ gcloud vmware private-connections describe my-private-connection

    In the second example, the project and location are taken from gcloud
    properties core/project and compute/region, respectively.
